*  Before, uh, sorry, go ahead. Oh, can I plug gigs real quick? Oh yeah. I got a busy weekend. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=28.36s)]
*  Uh, I got Raleigh, North Carolina, Hampstead, North Carolina, Myrtle beach. And then I'm [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=34.2s)]
*  off to Oakland, the city, Granbury, Texas, Shreveport, Louisiana, and the secret group. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=38.04s)]
*  All the links are on portstore.com except for the secret group, which you can find on [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=43.04s)]
*  their website. And then of course you and I, we got big gigs coming up. Oh yeah. We [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=46.28s)]
*  got, uh, Denver comedy works, uh, Cleveland hilarities, uh, the camp, uh, Denver and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=50.72s)]
*  Cleveland coming up real soon. Those are the next two and they are going to, I, I, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=56.56s)]
*  this is my first time doing Denver comedy works, but like all of my, all of my, uh, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=60.32s)]
*  bros are like, it's their favorite club, like Ari and Jay and all those guys always say [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=66.48s)]
*  they love Denver comedy work. So, and I know for years we have a big fan base out in Denver [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=71.68s)]
*  and, uh, we've never done a show there together, me and you. So I'm very excited to do a full [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=78.44s)]
*  weekend at Denver comedy works. And then Cleveland hilarities is just, that's up there [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=83.04s)]
*  in a very short list of like my absolute favorite comedy clubs in the country. So I'm very [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  excited to be back at both those places. And then I got the comedy mothership, the best, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  the biggest one. Um, so I got a lot of fun stuff coming up comic Dave Smith.com for all [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=97.56s)]
*  of those ticket links. Okay. So, whoo. What a 24 hours. What I mean, look, I got to say, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  man, and I've been, you know, I've been, I've been obsessed with politics for, uh, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=112.16s)]
*  just under 20 years. It was, uh, in 2007, Ron Paul's presidential campaign that I, uh, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=119.32s)]
*  I really got interested in this stuff. So it's whatever that is 18 years. Um, I've just been [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=126.12s)]
*  obsessed with this stuff. I've been podcasting about it for probably, you know, I think I've [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=131.76s)]
*  been doing part of the problem in one capacity or another for about 13 years. And then we've [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=137.44000000000003s)]
*  done it for me and you have done it together now for, um, when was it 2016? Me and you started, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  I think you came on the podcast eight or nine years or something. Something like that. We're, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  we're, we're closing in on a decade of me and you doing this together. And the, I will say [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  the last week has, it has been up there with the craziest weeks of us covering stuff. I mean, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=161.04s)]
*  you know, there's, we've, we've in this decade, we've seen some things, we saw lockdowns and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=169.12s)]
*  riots and wars and all types of different crazy shit. Um, but this is just, this has been wild [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=173.92s)]
*  and just the last 24 hours. I mean, we were, we were recording yesterday at this time. So 24 hours [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=181.04s)]
*  ago today, the word was Iran just launched a bunch of, uh, missiles toward us bases. And it [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=190.0s)]
*  seemed like this could be the, um, the start of a major escalation in this war. Um, what happened [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=197.68s)]
*  in the 24 hours since is quite a lot. So we'll try to get through all of it. But of course, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=206.16s)]
*  as you guys probably know by now, it came out, um, there were there, maybe even, I think there were, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=211.04s)]
*  I said, I believe on the show, I read one report that Iran had given advanced warning. Um, that, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=216.56s)]
*  that was confirmed by all sides, uh, very shortly after we got off the podcast. So the Qataris, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=223.68s)]
*  the Iranians and the Americans, Donald Trump himself, all confirmed that yes, Iran gave [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=230.4s)]
*  advanced warning. So that to, as to minimize casualties, which ended up, uh, being zero. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=236.0s)]
*  So they didn't kill anybody because they let everybody know exactly where they were targeting. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=242.8s)]
*  And Donald Trump seemed to, uh, signal that he was going to take that off ramp and that that would [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=247.44s)]
*  be, you know, this would be the end of it. Okay. They, you know, they responded, but the response [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  didn't do anything. So now we're gonna, we're going to move toward peace. Donald Trump then [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=261.04s)]
*  announced that a ceasefire agreement had been reached between, uh, Israel, Iran, and the United [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=265.12s)]
*  States of America. The Iranians then said, we've never even been showed a ceasefire agreement, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=271.28s)]
*  let alone come to an agreement on one. Then they, they were saying, yes, we will agree to a ceasefire. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  Then the Israelis, uh, bombed Iran again. And then Trump got very upset about that. Um, so well, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=285.2s)]
*  I guess let's just go right into, cause there's so many different angles here to cover. Sorry, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  go ahead. I would only add one, uh, uh, detail to that, which is the ceasefire, at least the way [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=299.6s)]
*  it was tweeted in classic Trump fashion. We haven't actually seen what the arrangement was or proof [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  that everyone agreed to it or what exactly was worked out. Uh, but in classic Trump fashion, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=310.16s)]
*  he claimed, Hey, deals already been done. And the deal included off the top of my head, it was 12 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  more hours of strikes that the Iranians were allowed to engage in and 24 more hours of strike [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=321.12s)]
*  that the Israelis were allowed to engage in. It's a little bit odd to have a ceasefire, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=325.92s)]
*  but allow people to get in their last licks. That does seem like there's still room for escalations. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=330.16s)]
*  It's odd for one party to get 12 hours and the other 24 hours. And then the issue of discontent, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  or at least from Trump's press conference was that the first round of bombing from Israel, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=340.56s)]
*  I think was the biggest one yet, uh, within the 24 hour period. And then apparently Israel claims [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=345.12s)]
*  that Iran struck him back just after the time period. And so that they were then firing back [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=350.88s)]
*  on Iran, uh, Trump claiming that that was a very small attack and that perhaps was fired before [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=356.48s)]
*  the deadline kind of speaks to the stupidity of the 12 and 24 hour periods of continuous strikes. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=361.6s)]
*  Uh, but Trump does seem to be pretty adamant of, Hey, you told me that there was one objective here, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=367.12s)]
*  which was taking out their nuclear program. That's done. I mean, he's not going to give [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=372.48s)]
*  us any proof of the fact that that's been completely neutralized, but as far as Trump's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=376.32s)]
*  concerned, that is completely neutralized. And so there's no reason for any future escalations. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=379.6s)]
*  And Israel needs to stop now trying to provoke a bigger fight because it's over. That seems to be [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=385.04s)]
*  where we're at, but Donald Trump's like flipping a coin where the news might change in 10 minutes [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  and I look like an asshole again. Yeah. Well, that's, that's exactly right. I mean, we look, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=394.16s)]
*  we have no idea right now. And Donald Trump was calling for Tehran to be evacuated and regime [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=398.88s)]
*  change a couple of days ago. And now he's calling for this, but he also was saying that they were [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=405.84s)]
*  negotiating a week ago or two weeks ago and then turned around and said, ah, the negotiations were [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  just a ruse in order to trick the Iranians. So maybe this is another ruse to trick the Iranian. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=418.4s)]
*  Like we don't know for sure. I will say that things look much more promising today than they [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=423.44s)]
*  did yesterday at this time. And, you know, I'm, I'm certain. So I'd just like to clarify one more [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=430.08s)]
*  thing. Peace in the world is more important than whether or not I look like an asshole. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=435.52s)]
*  And the tea leaves that I was going off of was really the JD Vance and Marco Ruby interviews, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=439.12s)]
*  where they just seem to be so flagrantly lying about not looking for escalations while taking [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=445.36s)]
*  very provoking actions such as striking the country and without giving evidence of more [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=451.36s)]
*  of a plan or the end of the nuclear program. So that's kind of what it seemed to me like they [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=456.72s)]
*  were looking for escalations. But the latest indicator from Donald Trump is that he would [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  like to be out and done with this, which is more important than whether or not yesterday I thought [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=465.36s)]
*  it looked like they were actually trying to escalate it. All right, guys, let's take a moment [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=470.24s)]
*  and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is the wellness company. Have you been feeling off [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=473.92s)]
*  since taking the COVID vaccine? You're not alone and new research backs it up in a groundbreaking [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=478.88000000000005s)]
*  study risk stratification for future cardiac arrest after the jab. Dr. Peter McCullough, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=484.72s)]
*  who many of you know was an absolute hero throughout the entire COVID insanity. He [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=491.36s)]
*  highlights an alarming rise in sudden cardiac events among young and previously healthy [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=496.16s)]
*  individuals. His study found that tiny hidden patches of heart inflammation, often missed by [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  doctors could silently be building up leading to a sudden heart attack during exercise or sleep. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=507.36s)]
*  That's why the wellness company created the three in one ultimate spike detox crafted with 100% [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=513.6s)]
*  natural ingredients specifically designed to help your body clear harmful spike proteins, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  reduce inflammation and support heart health. Don't wait until symptoms strike. Experience the only [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=526.4s)]
*  formula approved and used by Dr. McCullough, a top freedom fighting doctor who risked it all to tell [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=533.36s)]
*  the truth during COVID. Head on over to TWC.health slash problem and use the promo code problem to get [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=540.08s)]
*  10% off plus free shipping. Again, that's TWC.health slash problem promo code problem for 10% off and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=548.64s)]
*  free shipping. All right, let's get back into the show. Oh, I will I will gladly take avoiding a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=557.6s)]
*  catastrophe here and dealing with people saying, oh, you were an alarmist or you you know, you [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=563.2s)]
*  dropped Donald Trump too quickly or something like that. But you know, I gotta say, I am again, I look, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=567.92s)]
*  I don't really think we were wrong yesterday. The fact that a catastrophe may be averted doesn't [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=575.28s)]
*  mean we weren't flirting with a catastrophe. And the the fact is that the president of the United [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  States was screaming about regime change, like which is would have led to an absolute disaster. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=588.88s)]
*  So I don't think we were wrong to be speaking up against that. You know, I've heard from people on [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=594.72s)]
*  Twitter who are like, Oh, Dave, this was I thought this was supposed to turn into World War Three, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=600.32s)]
*  where's your World War Three? And like, first of all, I never predicted that this was going to turn [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=604.32s)]
*  into World War Three. I said that look, here's the thing that I think is like, it, there's a lot of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=608.4s)]
*  stuff I think that happened here. And this is maybe one of the positives of it. But I think [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=615.28s)]
*  there's a lot of kind of eye opening things that have happened even just in the last 24 hours, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=619.36s)]
*  like just the last day. And I'm hoping that some people see this. Number one, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  and I think maybe I made this point yesterday on on the show. But now that it's happened, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=631.28s)]
*  I think it's really important to hit this home again. Number one, there is something very [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=635.84s)]
*  revealing, like there's a lot of information that you get from the fact that once again, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  just like after Soleimani was killed, but except this time, it's a much bigger deal, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=647.92s)]
*  they just take off, you know, killing array in Iranian general in Iraq, they bombed the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=651.92s)]
*  heck out of the country and bombed their their, like legal nuclear program. And still, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=657.5999999999999s)]
*  Iran gives advanced notice so that Americans aren't killed. Now, I'm sorry, but that tells [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  you something about that regime. And it really, really undercuts the entire neocon premise for [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=675.28s)]
*  why we have to be in a conflict with Iran to begin with. Their whole argument is that if Iran gets [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=683.36s)]
*  nukes, Iran is so evil and crazy that they will just use them because they're religious fanatics [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=689.04s)]
*  who don't care about their own survival. They're essentially a regime of suicide bombers. So if [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=696.4s)]
*  they get a nuke, they're going to nuke Israel and then they don't even care that they know nukes are [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=701.28s)]
*  going to be flying back in their directions. That foundational claim to this entire conflict [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=705.12s)]
*  is just been so tremendously weakened at this point, because you're telling me that these are [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=713.6s)]
*  suicidal maniacs. But even when their country has been attacked, you know, in a war of aggression, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=718.8s)]
*  even when they've been attacked, they still don't want it, which is what this is consistent with [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=726.4s)]
*  everything Iran has done for the last 25 years. They do not want it. They don't. And for very [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=733.68s)]
*  obvious reasons. Of course, they want it. They don't want to actually end up killing Americans, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=740.72s)]
*  because if they did kill a bunch of Americans, what do you think Donald Trump's response to that [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=745.1999999999999s)]
*  would have been? It would have been total destruction of the country and that catastrophe [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=749.52s)]
*  that we were talking about. But it's a catastrophe, first and foremost, for the mullahs. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=753.6s)]
*  The ayatollah is not coming out of that thing alive if we went that direction. And so actually, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=759.12s)]
*  it seems that, like most human beings, they are motivated by self-preservation and that they would [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  much rather continue to rule their country than be killed. That's how human beings tend to be. And [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=773.44s)]
*  even really, really bad people, you know, Joseph Stalin had nuclear weapons and Mao Zedong had [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=781.6s)]
*  nuclear weapons. These are amongst the most evil human beings who have ever lived. But they didn't [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  just go and nuke another country for no reason, because even they knew that if they did that, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=790.96s)]
*  nukes would be flying back at them and then they would die. And they did not wish to die. They [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=796.48s)]
*  wished to rule. And so I think that is one of the first, like, and most important takeaways of the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=800.72s)]
*  last 24 hours. But if you think about it, you know, because I've had quite a few people telling [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=807.28s)]
*  me that, you know, I was wrong to denounce Donald Trump and to rescind my support for him and all [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=815.12s)]
*  of that. But I don't think I was. And I wouldn't do it any different if I could go back, you know, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=822.0799999999999s)]
*  like this is the look, think about the position that Donald Trump put this country in for absolutely [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=828.48s)]
*  no reason, for absolutely no reason. He put us in the position that we were relying on Iranian [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=834.8s)]
*  restraint. You know, this country that everyone tells you is the big bad wolf is such a thing that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=842.16s)]
*  must be confronted and all of this. He put us in a position where it was only their restraint that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  allowed us to not get pulled into this war. Because look, we all know, we all know that if [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=854.9599999999999s)]
*  Iran had killed a bunch of Americans yesterday, which they could have done, and they chose not [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=860.64s)]
*  to do that, we would have just been lighting up Tehran right now. Today, we would be we would be [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=865.76s)]
*  doing a much different podcast today. If Iran hadn't given advanced warning to ensure that there [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=871.6s)]
*  were no casualties, we would be doing a much different podcast, we'd be lighting up Tehran [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=876.96s)]
*  right now, and probably thinking about invading the country. And so thank God it didn't come to [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=881.6800000000001s)]
*  that. What a risky game to play. You know, I as I always have with Donald Trump, as you always have [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=888.24s)]
*  with Donald Trump, Rob, we'll call balls and strikes here. I will hammer him when he does [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=894.24s)]
*  bad things and praise him when he does good things. So very stupid to get us involved in this war. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=898.96s)]
*  Incredibly reckless and risky, but good for Donald Trump. It's absolutely all of that being done. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=905.04s)]
*  It's amazing if he can try to push a ceasefire deal now and pull us out of this. But I don't [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=912.32s)]
*  really think I don't know, I'm not seeing how we were wrong. I didn't I didn't say ever that this [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=917.92s)]
*  will search with certainty be another Iraq style war. I always said the danger is in the escalation. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=923.28s)]
*  And it was the Iranians who gave us an off ramp. And in this case, that's just the facts, like [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=930.56s)]
*  however people feel about that. And then the other thing that I hope is is revealed to some people [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=935.52s)]
*  is is how much the Israelis just like it doesn't matter. It is such an [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=941.2s)]
*  outrage that they would do this after Donald Trump decided he didn't want to like imagine [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=948.88s)]
*  that our fat welfare mom of a country who can't who can't do anything without us who just gets [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=954.88s)]
*  has gotten 10s of billions of dollars of support from America and we prop them up and we protect [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=961.84s)]
*  them and we fight wars on their behalf. We just fought a 12 day war on their behalf and then [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=967.76s)]
*  they'll turn around and not only not not try to convince Donald Trump, but go ahead and try to [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=972.4s)]
*  get him go ahead and do it and then try to get him dragged back into the war. I just don't like how [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  do you not treat a country like that as an enemy of your country? It is just beyond wild to me. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=984.48s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Massa chips. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=990.4s)]
*  Did you know all chips and fries used to be cooked in tallow up until the 1990s when big [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=994.72s)]
*  corporations switched to cheap processed seed oils today seed oils make up to 20% of the average [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1000.08s)]
*  Americans daily calories and recent studies have linked seed oils to metabolic health issues and [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1006.4s)]
*  inflammation in the body. Massa decided to do something about it. They created a tasty and [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1011.84s)]
*  delicious tortilla chip with just three ingredients and no seed oils. These chips don't only avoid all [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1017.28s)]
*  of the bad stuff, but they taste great too. Massa is crunchier tastier and sturdier than other chips, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1023.44s)]
*  so you won't spill your guac. Snacking on Massa chips is nothing like eating regular chips with [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1029.44s)]
*  Massa. You feel satisfied, light and energetic with no crash, no blow and no gross sluggish feeling [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1034.24s)]
*  afterward. And as an added bonus, the beef tallow makes the chips much more satiating, so you won't [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1040.96s)]
*  find yourself binging and still feeling hungry afterward. Massa chips are beloved by tens of [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1046.48s)]
*  thousands of customers and have been endorsed by industry leading health and nutrition experts [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1052.0s)]
*  like Ben Greenfield and Gary Brekka. If you're ready to give Massa a try, go to massachips.com [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1057.04s)]
*  slash Dave and use the promo code Dave for 25% off your first order. That's massachips.com slash [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1064.16s)]
*  Dave and use the promo code Dave for 25% off your first order. All right, let's get back into the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1072.64s)]
*  show. Well, I think that really speaks to my personal confusion about where we're at at the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1078.32s)]
*  moment, because it seems like the Israelis still want regime change, and I guess they're without [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1085.2s)]
*  their lie at the moment of that Iran is looking to go nuclear. On the same note, if Iran was always [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1090.24s)]
*  looking to go nuclear, I don't exactly understand why after what just happened, they wouldn't [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  continue to pursue those efforts or they would just be done with those efforts. It could be, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1102.08s)]
*  I guess, that they've got some sort of a security guarantee almost in Donald Trump's ego, that if [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1106.56s)]
*  Donald Trump can claim that he took away their entire nuclear program, he's not going to turn [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1111.6799999999998s)]
*  his back on them. And they can now actually sell oil in a more legitimate fashion to China and not [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1116.8799999999999s)]
*  have to hear that they're the enemy of the entire world. So maybe at least for the next couple years, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1124.24s)]
*  that's the best option that they've ever had. And they're actually willing to trust Donald Trump, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1129.04s)]
*  even though there were definitely some deeks in the current process so far by him. It just seems [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1133.52s)]
*  like, I don't know, it seemed like a remarkable claim when he just said, hey, there's a ceasefire, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1141.44s)]
*  and then there was reporting the Iranians didn't know about it, that there's a 12 and 24 hour period [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1145.2s)]
*  that the Iranians were not looking to respond more aggressively and ramp up the cost for kind [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1150.4s)]
*  of bullying them in this fashion. And it's like, I don't know, on both sides, I could see the [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1157.12s)]
*  Iranians now being more aggressive. And that wouldn't validate that the previous theory had [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1162.48s)]
*  been true. But at the moment, they seem to be just not looking for the action, not looking for the [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1166.88s)]
*  fight. So I don't know, to me, it's just, I'm a little bit confused as to what happened here. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1171.76s)]
*  And the most striking lie to me at the moment is just the idea that they were both 14 days away, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1177.28s)]
*  and that this single strike, which has yet to be confirmed by anyone other than Donald Trump going, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1182.88s)]
*  no, believe me, I'm telling you, that's what happened. And then, you know, it's the classic [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1188.32s)]
*  bluster. Well, I don't know, as the intelligence community validated the fact that these assets [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1191.84s)]
*  have been completely taken out. Do you know where the centrifuges are? Do you know that you took [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1197.28s)]
*  out all the centrifuges? Do you know what happened to all the enriched uranium? No, just trust me, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1201.12s)]
*  I'm telling you, it's completely done and it's finished. So I find myself more lost in this [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1205.9199999999998s)]
*  storyline than the typical storylines that we cover. Well, yeah, I mean, I think it's because [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1210.6399999999999s)]
*  it's just very unclear what is actually happening. And the point that you made there is absolutely [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1216.0s)]
*  correct. That should be, which is one of the most important ones that it's just, it is completely [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1222.64s)]
*  ridiculous to sit here and claim that we've completely obliterated their nuclear capabilities. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1227.8400000000001s)]
*  We have nothing to back that up. We really don't even know what exactly we've done and what we [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1233.04s)]
*  haven't done. And, you know, the regime is still in power. It looks like that's not going anywhere [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1237.44s)]
*  now because really you need America to overthrow that regime. If Israel could do it on their own, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1244.48s)]
*  they would have done it a long time ago. They can't and that's why they are constantly trying [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1249.6s)]
*  to pressure America into doing it. But they already have the knowledge. I mean, they mastered the fuel [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  cycle. They have the sciences. They can get materials. They can rebuild what they have. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1261.04s)]
*  And of course, we have now incentivized them more than ever to pursue nuclear weapons. So the whole [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1266.16s)]
*  thing just seems ridiculous and unnecessary. Let's play the clip that was, you know, making [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1272.24s)]
*  all the waves this morning. This is quite a turnaround for Donald Trump in the last few [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1280.64s)]
*  days. But here is what Donald Trump had to say earlier today. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1287.36s)]
*  Yes, they violated it, but Israel violated it too. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1302.48s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1308.96s)]
*  which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. You [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1313.52s)]
*  know, when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour, just drop [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1318.96s)]
*  everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. But I'm [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1324.32s)]
*  really unhappy of Israel's going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land that was [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1329.28s)]
*  shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. I'm not happy about that. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1334.72s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1341.76s)]
*  that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. Do you understand that? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1346.96s)]
*  You have to respond to Rob. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1350.16s)]
*  All right. So that was President Trump giving his thoughts on the violations of the ceasefire by both [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1355.6000000000001s)]
*  Israel and Iran. And I will say I like when presidents curse. I do enjoy that. I think [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1364.0s)]
*  it's something that men should do. Let me say this, and then you can give your thoughts on it, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1372.4s)]
*  Rob. But let me just say this. You know, a lot of people, as I mentioned yesterday, a lot of people [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1379.12s)]
*  were like a lot of a lot of Trump supporters were like thrilled with me. You know, I've had this [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1388.6399999999999s)]
*  relationship with with Trump supporters for many years at this point. My profile is higher than [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1394.0s)]
*  ever. So I get more of it now. But for many years, Rob, as you know, you know, Trump supporters would [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1399.6s)]
*  love me because, you know, I was, you know, me and you were like amongst the best at smacking down [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1406.0s)]
*  the Russiagate bullshit. That was like a big focus on the show for many years. Maybe was probably our [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1413.28s)]
*  number one issue for a while. And we were great at defending how he had obviously been framed by his [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1420.24s)]
*  intelligence agencies and then, you know, framing the sitting president of the United States of [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1426.88s)]
*  America for treasons. Pretty big deal. And so we were very good on that. So the Trump supporters [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1430.8s)]
*  love that. But then I'd come out and criticize his foreign policy or whatever. And you know, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1434.72s)]
*  the Trump supporters would be mad at me. They'd be like, you know, when I came out and supported [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1439.04s)]
*  him and said I was going to vote for him, a lot of the Trump supporters were thrilled about that. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1442.8s)]
*  When I came out and said I regret my vote and I take it back, a lot of them were furious at me about [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1445.84s)]
*  that. Look, when it comes down to it, my my role in all of this, as I've always said, is like, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1450.96s)]
*  I have to tell the truth. That's my promise to the audience. That's my job. My job is to make [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1460.72s)]
*  people laugh in comedy clubs and tell the truth on podcasts. That's what I'm supposed to do. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1470.16s)]
*  And that's in these times. I'm not capable, I'm not smart enough or dishonest enough to like take [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1475.44s)]
*  into account all of the different calculations and all of this. It's like just tell the truth. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1487.36s)]
*  When there's a storm going on, you tell the truth. You just truth your way out of it. That's how I've [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1491.84s)]
*  always operated. That's what's gotten me here. And that's what I'm going to keep doing. There [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1496.24s)]
*  are a lot of Trump supporters, a lot. And some of them might be right to make this decision. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1500.08s)]
*  There's a lot of very influential kind of right wingers in this country who simply will not [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1505.28s)]
*  criticize Donald Trump himself. They'll criticize everyone else around him. They'll be against a [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1510.24s)]
*  policy that he's pursuing, but they will find a way not to criticize Donald Trump because that [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1515.28s)]
*  turns off a big part of their audience. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to be the guy who [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1520.56s)]
*  plays that game. And I'm also not going to just let him off the hook. And like this is, you know, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1526.16s)]
*  okay. He said here, oh, I'm mad at Israel. No, Israel shouldn't have done that. And now everybody's [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1532.8s)]
*  making a big deal about it. Oh, he said, you know, he cursed and he brought up Israel. He was actually [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1539.44s)]
*  kind of harsh about them. This is the harshest we've ever seen him about Israel. It's like, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1543.92s)]
*  okay, you just launched a war on their behalf, dude. You just took our country to the brink of [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1547.76s)]
*  catastrophe for this country that is now spitting in your face. It was Iranian restraint that kept [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1553.92s)]
*  us from being in a goddamn catastrophe right now, all on behalf of the Israelis. So is this all you [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1561.68s)]
*  got? Is this it? And what do we do after that? After this? Go back to unconditionally supporting [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1567.28s)]
*  them. You know, Donald Trump at this point, he's been in for a while. Israel has kept up the [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1573.12s)]
*  destruction of Gaza this entire time. And Donald Trump's been financing it and arming the whole [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1578.9599999999998s)]
*  thing. So like, I'll believe this or I'll be impressed by this when it comes with anything [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1583.36s)]
*  of substance, anything, you know, is it so like, what do you, you're telling me that you want peace [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1590.7199999999998s)]
*  and Israel is undermining that, but they still get more foreign aid than any other country from [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1599.8400000000001s)]
*  you. They still get all of this support. Why? Why should that be the case? So I'm sorry, like, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1605.76s)]
*  this is, this isn't like winning me back over or convincing me I was wrong to be so harsh on [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1614.16s)]
*  Donald Trump for this. Donald Trump, you know, he calls it the 12 day war. That's what he dubbed it. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1620.64s)]
*  It's not clear that that's over at all. Usually you wait to be sure that conclusion. Like, I don't [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1626.88s)]
*  know, Rob, like, I don't know, by the way, this is a question for a historian that I do not know the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1631.6000000000001s)]
*  answer to. But I don't know when the 1967 war between Egypt, Jordan and Israel got dubbed the [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1636.48s)]
*  six day war. But my guess is what it wasn't on the sixth day. You know what I'm saying? Like, I don't, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1644.0s)]
*  I don't think they decided on the sixth day, we will now call this the six day war. I think [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1650.16s)]
*  probably they waited a couple days to like know that it was over. But maybe I'm wrong. I honestly [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1654.72s)]
*  don't know the answer to that question. When was was the war dubbed the six day war? But like, okay, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1661.92s)]
*  you want to call this the 12 day war? Okay, fine. But it was a war. You know, you led us to war on [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1666.24s)]
*  behalf of a foreign nature and risked a catastrophe that was only averted by Iranian restraint. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1672.0s)]
*  On behalf of Israel, I'm sorry, that is not something that like, I don't regret calling him out for that. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1678.16s)]
*  And the other thing I'll say, I'm sorry, I will throw this over to you, Rob, is that it was, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1686.96s)]
*  look, I don't know what role if any, the, you know, people with with these, these shows played. But I [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1692.0s)]
*  will say that all of the people, there were so many hardcore Trump supporters who came out against [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1702.88s)]
*  this thing, that it's not, it's possible that that played some degree of a role that he knew he was [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1708.3200000000002s)]
*  really going to permanently fracture his coalition if he did any more than this. And so at the time, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1714.16s)]
*  I'm not even saying that made the difference. I'm totally speculating. I have no idea if that made [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1721.1200000000001s)]
*  the difference or not. But we didn't really have any other power than that. So like, I don't regret [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1725.2s)]
*  going as hard as we went. I think it's the it was the right thing to do. Anyway, your thoughts, Rob, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1730.32s)]
*  on Donald Trump saying Iran and Israel do not know what the fuck is going on, or what the fuck they're [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1735.9199999999998s)]
*  doing. I was saying, you know, I think this was a month ago, I talked about this around your mouth. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1741.04s)]
*  The Israelis were claiming that they just needed one targeted strike and they could get rid of the [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1747.4399999999998s)]
*  nuclear program. And I said, if that's true, then go ahead and do it. And if it's not true, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1750.96s)]
*  it's time to break up with this crazy girlfriend is just trying to get us into a fight. And so [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1754.6399999999999s)]
*  it looks like Trump's finally learning that they're the crazy girlfriend. Everyone keeps telling them, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1759.28s)]
*  hey, that lady's just creating a problem for you. I don't think you want her in your life. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1763.28s)]
*  And they finally just pushed far enough and that they are not adhering to the ceasefire, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1767.2s)]
*  that even Trump's like, yeah, I think I need out of this relationship. Now, what's kind of most [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1772.48s)]
*  interesting to me is there's a lot of people that speculate that Netanyahu bitched Trump out with [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1778.3999999999999s)]
*  the initial strike. And usually, when that kind of thing happens, Trump would turn around, go [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1783.84s)]
*  scorched earth and go, hey, I was working on a deal. I would have gotten you guys a deal. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1788.4s)]
*  And that's it. We're done with you. For some reason, Israel seems to have a special place [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1792.16s)]
*  in Trump's heart and have a special hold over him that he's willing to play ball with them in a way [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1797.6000000000001s)]
*  that he won't anywhere else. And so it's interesting that they pushed hard enough on this one that at [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1802.64s)]
*  least there was a moment of the real Trump that you got to see live in camera saying these people [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1808.24s)]
*  are fucking idiots and then walking off in the coolest fashion, almost pulling a Biden where [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1813.3600000000001s)]
*  he wasn't sure if he was supposed to get on the helicopter or not, but then committed to the walk [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1817.76s)]
*  off. So you have to continue the walk off. You got to go. You're like, I don't know. You got [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1821.2s)]
*  to take me somewhere now, dude. I already walked over here. Yeah, I can't go back in front of those [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1824.56s)]
*  two. I don't know, dude. Do a couple laps and then bring me right back down here. But I got to, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1828.96s)]
*  I have to finish this walk off. But as we've seen, it's hard to tell with Trump and particularly the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1833.44s)]
*  Israelis to what extent things are theater was the meeting with Witkoff that was supposed to [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1838.8799999999999s)]
*  take place with the Iranians theater was when he, when he didn't visit Israel was that theater. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1843.52s)]
*  So it's just hard to tell, but it does seem like Israel almost bluff by saying, hey, we just need [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1848.48s)]
*  to take this action and we can get rid of their nukes. And then Netanyahu even went on air and said, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1854.32s)]
*  we have, we've gotten rid of the nuke thing. And so now Trump is going, all right, then that's what [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1860.0s)]
*  you guys told me we needed to do. So we can be done with this regime change, which would be a [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1864.16s)]
*  giant mistake. And I think now the Israelis are trying to re strategize and figure out, well, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1867.92s)]
*  how do we keep this fight continuing? Because that's really what we were looking for. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1873.44s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, I think it's just the idea to me again, I'm just, look, I'm not gonna, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1878.88s)]
*  I'm not going to treat Donald Trump like he's a baby. This is the idea that he's just now figuring [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1887.44s)]
*  out that Israel's trying to drag us into wars is just to me, even if, if that were the case, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1894.0s)]
*  then it's like, dude, how the fuck did you not figure that out already? By the way, just to [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1899.1200000000001s)]
*  give some more updates to this. So then Donald Trump takes to truth social. This is from the, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1904.24s)]
*  this more, this is from six hours ago. So Donald Trump, please Lord Trump, our fewer, if you could [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1911.2s)]
*  not do anything within the next four hours of this episode coming out. Yeah, at least try. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1917.2s)]
*  If you could break, if you could try to keep it till after 1pm, Monday through Thursday, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1922.3200000000002s)]
*  we'd really appreciate that. So Donald Trump takes to truth social and says Israel, all capital [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1928.96s)]
*  letters, not sure why, but this is Donald Trump. He's, he does all caps and air quotes sometimes [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1934.48s)]
*  that just don't make sense. But anyway, or I guess not air quotes, they would be quotes, just quotes. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1941.68s)]
*  Anyway, he said Israel, all capital letters is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1947.36s)]
*  around and head home while doing a friendly plane wave to Iran. Nobody will be hurt. The ceasefire [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1956.4799999999998s)]
*  is in effect. Thank you for your attention to this matter, which is what he says lately. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1964.32s)]
*  Okay. Then he had a post about how we are finally entering our golden age. Then, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1970.32s)]
*  and this is as of about an hour ago, Israel's chief of staff. I don't know what that position [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1979.9199999999998s)]
*  means in Israel, but Israel's chief of staff, quote, campaign against Iran is not over. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1990.48s)]
*  So, I mean, look, even just that, you're like, dude, what are you, what are you guys doing? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=1997.04s)]
*  Like, it's just such an outrage. It's like, look, man, I, if you want to make some type of like [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2003.28s)]
*  sovereignty argument to me or something like that, then fine. Like, okay, Israel's its own country. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2008.16s)]
*  They, Donald Trump is not their boss, clearly. And so if they want to go like, no, you told us not to [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2013.84s)]
*  attack, but we're not done. We're going to keep attacking. Fine. But then he says, well, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2020.16s)]
*  not done. We're going to keep attacking. Fine. But like, do it with your own weapons and your [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2024.48s)]
*  own money. You don't get to do it with ours. If you're doing it with ours, then our president [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2029.76s)]
*  gets to decide what we're doing here. And like, oh, so do it, do it on your own. Oh, that's right. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2034.72s)]
*  But you can't do it on your own. Can you? You can't do anything on your own. And this, you know, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2039.68s)]
*  imagine what this would look like without American weapons, without American money, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2044.88s)]
*  and without America's protection, shooting down the missiles that are headed back toward Israel. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2048.96s)]
*  You know, they brag so much about their iron dome. They've always bragged about this for many, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2053.76s)]
*  many years, but every time someone launches missiles, Adam, they pick up the phone and call [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2058.4s)]
*  uncle Sam and go, you got to help us shoot these things down. Yeah. I mean, I guess it's, it's [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2063.6000000000004s)]
*  pretty good at, you know, knocking down the, the home made, the homemade rockets from Gaza, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2068.48s)]
*  you know, the rockets that are like made out of cleaning supplies. Yeah. They shoot those things [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2076.0800000000004s)]
*  down, but it doesn't seem to work too good against Iranian missiles. And so again, it's just, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2081.04s)]
*  just a total outrage that like, it's just, you see the way Israel is treating Donald Trump, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2088.16s)]
*  who just launched, launched a war on their behalf. I just don't understand how any American could [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2093.92s)]
*  not be just like appalled by that. Just absolutely appalled. All right. So maybe this is a good time [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2100.0s)]
*  to, there's interesting, another interesting angle here. And this is perhaps the best indicator [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2108.64s)]
*  of a potential positive outcome here is that the Warhawks are now furious with Donald Trump. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2118.7999999999997s)]
*  Have you, have you seen any of that Rob? I've seen it. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2125.68s)]
*  Bolton who was praising him yesterday is I think now saying the job's not done. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2128.08s)]
*  Yeah. Isn't it unbelievable. It's like, well, anyone with any sense about them is concerned [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2133.92s)]
*  with like the potential catastrophe in this situation. You actually see who is upset that [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2140.0s)]
*  we avoided it. Like it's just unbelievable. But Mark Levin and all of these guys, there was one, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2146.4s)]
*  this, which I actually couldn't believe she said this, let me see if I could find it. But there was [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2153.04s)]
*  one, the Israeli woman who I was arguing with, oh yeah, it's Emily Schrader. I'm not sure how [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2159.44s)]
*  to pronounce that. But so, so when Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, he said, Israel, do not [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2169.84s)]
*  drop those bombs. If you do it, it is a major violation. Bring your pilots home now, Donald J [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2176.6400000000003s)]
*  Trump, president of the United States. And she tweeted, uh, someone's in bed with Qatar. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2183.76s)]
*  Like she's going to him the same thing they say about me and like Candace Owens and Tucker [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2190.8s)]
*  Carlson or whatever they go, they're all paid by Qatar. By the way, I'm, I'm still waiting on this [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2196.2400000000002s)]
*  Katari check that's supposedly coming my way. Yeah. All right. Well, there you go. Rob wants jet. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2201.6800000000003s)]
*  Would that be crazy if a jet just showed up outside your house right now? And they were like, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2208.7200000000003s)]
*  it was the first time you asked you want the jet, you object. Um, you can't park it here. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2212.48s)]
*  He goes, oh, you didn't, you didn't ask for a parking spot. You just asked for jets. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2218.32s)]
*  We deliver Jack. Um, no, so the, but like this is Mark Levin's been freaking out at him. All of [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2222.48s)]
*  these Hawks now are turning on Donald Trump, which is just like another, I don't know. It's another [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2228.16s)]
*  wrinkle of just kind of hilarity in all of this is that of course, as these things are swinging, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2232.32s)]
*  so like first he off the non-intervention aside. Now he's off, uh, the Hawks, but you know, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2237.92s)]
*  look, there's a few things here. Number one, it, you know, it's like, look, make no mistake about [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2245.28s)]
*  it. Like the Hawks goal, as it always has been, is a regime change here. And they are looking at [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2251.44s)]
*  this and seeing this as probably their best opportunity to get a regime change. Like they, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2258.16s)]
*  they actually got America to launch a war against Iran. And so once you've gotten that, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2265.44s)]
*  I mean, that's a huge part of the, the, you know, that that's a big first step. And so they are [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2272.08s)]
*  going to be very upset if it actually is the case that this is ending here and there's going to be [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2277.92s)]
*  a ceasefire and the Molas are going to remain in power. They're not going to be happy about that. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2282.96s)]
*  So they're furious about Donald Trump now. Um, and it's so now this is, you know, there's the, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2287.44s)]
*  the interesting split between MAGA is, is kind of fascinating here, but I, you know, I will say, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2295.04s)]
*  because there's kind of, you know, this dynamic where like, you know, I made some waves by [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2303.6s)]
*  denouncing Donald Trump a few days ago, and now you got these guys denouncing Donald Trump, uh, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2309.04s)]
*  over this, but they're really, there is an obvious asymmetry between the two, you know, it's like, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2316.32s)]
*  I myself, and then other people who were obviously were not as personally harsh on Donald Trump and [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2324.08s)]
*  some of them for good reason, but you know, people far more influential than me, you know, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2330.16s)]
*  people like Tucker Carlson and, and Steve Bannon, um, were, were really, you know, they were excellent [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2334.24s)]
*  on this. Um, and this was a moment too, that was one of the things that really came out of this is [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2340.96s)]
*  you kind of like, there's a real moment to see who's who and see who's really, you know, gonna [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2345.92s)]
*  be strong even when Donald Trump's leading in a, in a terrible direction. But there were a lot of [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2351.36s)]
*  people who really passed that test with flying colors and, but like the difference between them [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2356.6400000000003s)]
*  is that like, so like I was denouncing Donald Trump because I was, I was concerned that he was [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2363.84s)]
*  leading us into a catastrophe for the United States of America. These people are now furious [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2370.56s)]
*  with Donald Trump because he didn't get the regime change that Israel wants a catastrophe for America [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2377.2799999999997s)]
*  come if it may, like there's a real difference between the two there and the fact that people [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2385.6s)]
*  like Mark Levin and this crazy Israeli lady and John Bolton and Lindsey Graham and Bill Crystal [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2392.96s)]
*  and all of these guys who are out there, um, uh, you know, pushing for a regime change. And now [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2400.7200000000003s)]
*  many of them are out there trashing Donald Trump for talking about a ceasefire. These people are [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2407.04s)]
*  the, the people who cheerlead the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan and the war in Libya and [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2412.64s)]
*  the war in Syria and Syria and the war in, in Somalia and the war in Yemen and the drone bomb [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2418.08s)]
*  campaign in, in Pakistan and the special ops campaigns in Niger and all this stuff, all of [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2424.4s)]
*  them. And they're just chilly and none of them show the slightest concern that what they're [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2431.44s)]
*  cheerleading now could be as catastrophic as those are maybe even worse. Like there's just no concern [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2437.68s)]
*  about it. It's just totally like, no, do it, go for the regime change because the truth is, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2442.88s)]
*  and I hope this is laid bare. It's a case I've been making for years, but it's so obvious now [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2448.4s)]
*  is that they want this regime change for Israel. And that's that. And they, if a catastrophe comes [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2453.12s)]
*  with it, you know, then that's that it's like, they, they look back at Iraq and go, well, we [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2459.44s)]
*  did get Saddam out of there. You know, they achieved their goal and sure, you know, a million [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2464.7200000000003s)]
*  people died and including, you know, thousands of American soldiers and sure it costs trillions of [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2470.48s)]
*  dollars and destabilize the region. But yeah, they, you know, mission accomplished for them. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2476.08s)]
*  That banner is real. The mission was accomplished. And so they, they're happy with it and they would [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2481.44s)]
*  have been happy to see that again here. And that is just like, I don't know. I just think that is, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2486.88s)]
*  that is, it's like such a profound crime as people should never listen to these guys again. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2492.4s)]
*  It's just totally outrageous. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2501.52s)]
*  today's show, which is monetary metals, an amazing company run by great guys that I've been promoting [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2505.8399999999997s)]
*  for a long time. They have really revolutionized the gold and silver space for many years. Many of [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2511.2799999999997s)]
*  us have owned gold and silver as a hedge against inflation, but typically we either have physical [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2517.6s)]
*  bars that are just collecting dust in our homes, or you're having them professionally stored and [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2522.56s)]
*  then you're paying fees for having it stored. But now there's a new alternative option and a much [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2527.2s)]
*  better one, which is monetary metals with monetary metals. Not only do you own physical gold and [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2532.48s)]
*  silver, but you own physical gold and silver that works for you accruing interest, which is paid in [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2537.68s)]
*  additional ounces. So you're growing your total amount of gold or your total amount of silver, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2543.6s)]
*  and it's being stored for you for free. This is a no brainer. If you own gold and silver, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2548.48s)]
*  this is the best way to do it. Go check them out at monetary dash metals.com. That's monetary dash [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2553.8399999999997s)]
*  metals.com. All right, let's get back into the show. Let's, let's go to the Steve Bannon clip, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2560.16s)]
*  because here was Steve Bannon talking about this, this very dynamic. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2567.12s)]
*  You have the gall, particularly of what this guy did for you and the grief he's taken over here. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2574.08s)]
*  You had the gall when he said, this is what I've done and I need you to be a partner. I need you to [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2581.44s)]
*  stand down. First is where I can't stand. I can't stop at all, which is another lie of the many [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2589.52s)]
*  lies we've gotten from the Netanyahu government. A bald faced lie. Well, then he says, okay, I need [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2596.96s)]
*  it. I need you to stand down. I can't have any scale. If you can't get some guys back, it's fine. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2604.96s)]
*  Goes to bed, gets a couple hours sleep, wakes up and you lied to him. That's why he's furious. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2608.48s)]
*  That's as mad as I've ever seen the president of the United States. And think about it. How [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2615.28s)]
*  did you get his anger like that? Given everything he's done for you and the pressure he's under and [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2618.4s)]
*  a couple hours sleep, and he's got it in a freaking plane and fly for what? Six, eight hours [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2623.6s)]
*  to sit down with this crowded NATO, which you know, he's just wildly enthusiastic about doing [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2628.96s)]
*  that. And plus putting himself going in the air at a time when you're in a shooting conflict in [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2633.12s)]
*  the world, putting his life at risk to do that. And this is what he gets. This is the thanks he [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2638.4s)]
*  gets. So don't sit there and don't glazing. Netanyahu goes on Israel TV and glazes him. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2643.92s)]
*  Don't glazing. Don't slobber all over him. It doesn't mean anything. You showed what you [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2650.16s)]
*  really thought of him last night. Oh, President Trump's the greatest. You showed exactly [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2655.7599999999998s)]
*  your appreciation last night. You showed exactly. And do I see any of the the Baghdad, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2662.56s)]
*  Bob equivalents, the Tel Aviv, Levins or any of this crowd today calling him out? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2668.16s)]
*  They never call it Netanyahu who got Israel into this. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2673.6s)]
*  And for supporters of Israel, which is kind of on the ropes about this, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2678.96s)]
*  makes it very hard when someone when your top guys dealing from the bottom of the deck [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2686.56s)]
*  is not straight. And the fact not only not straight, he's a bald faced liar. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2693.44s)]
*  But the games you want to play, if you support Israel and you love Israel, you want to see [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2698.4s)]
*  Israel not just survive, but thrive, you better be asking hard questions. You better be asking [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2705.2799999999997s)]
*  hard questions. You better be asking hard questions and demanding straight answers. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2712.7999999999997s)]
*  It is a it just cannot be overstated how remarkable it is. The transformation in the way [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2718.8s)]
*  very, very influential people in the Republican Party are talking about Israel these days, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2731.44s)]
*  first years ago. It's just unbelievable. And now you've seen now Steve Bannon, of course, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2738.8s)]
*  for saying this is being really attacked by the Mark Levin crowd. But ultimately, I think they [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2744.64s)]
*  kind of seem in a way they seem to be out of bullets in terms of like moving the needle with [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2753.3599999999997s)]
*  people. You know, they're not out of bullets in terms of moving the needle with the Trump [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2761.8399999999997s)]
*  administration. But they really do seem to be like out of it's like, who? I don't know, Rob, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2766.4s)]
*  I mean, what do you think? Who can even argue with what Steve Bannon's saying right now? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2771.84s)]
*  And of course, I saw the thing Mark Levin was just smearing him, you know, you're an anti-Semite or [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2775.28s)]
*  something like that, because that's like the only thing they can say. It's like, what other argument [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2779.36s)]
*  do you actually have? It's as clear as day that like that, that Israel is trying to drag America [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2783.04s)]
*  into another war for on their behalf. And who I just don't understand who can support that. I [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2790.6400000000003s)]
*  don't know. Any thoughts, Rob? They're going to have to start making claims of that the nuclear [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2796.56s)]
*  program wasn't actually destroyed and Donald Trump didn't complete his mission. And my guess [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2801.2s)]
*  is that they don't want to criticize Trump in that fashion, at least not yet, which doesn't leave them [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2805.2799999999997s)]
*  with too many cards for as to why we need to be continuing this, this operation. Yeah, no, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2811.2799999999997s)]
*  that's right. And by the way, it should be mentioned that there's I think it was actually, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2817.3599999999997s)]
*  let me check the number on this. It was according to the Associated Press. This is what happened [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2821.52s)]
*  today, because it's another day. Death toll of aid seekers near Gaza, near Gaza hubs rises to 44. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2829.36s)]
*  Witnesses and hospitals say Israeli forces and drones open fire toward hundreds of Palestinians [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2840.96s)]
*  waiting for aid in separate incidents in southern and central Gaza, killing at least 44. Witnesses [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2848.0800000000004s)]
*  and hospitals said as health authorities announced, the number of Palestinian killed [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2856.0s)]
*  in the war has risen above 56,000. So literally, this is yet another incident of Gazans being killed [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2860.56s)]
*  as they're trying to get aid in in Gaza. This is you know, it's funny, because I've done, oh my god, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2872.8s)]
*  so many of these debates at this point, and the way every Israel supporter always says like, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2880.24s)]
*  we're targeting Hamas, and we're unintentionally killing some innocent people. And yet you just [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2886.08s)]
*  see video after video report after report of people trying to get food. Have you seen any [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2891.6s)]
*  of the videos, Rob, of where they're like running up to the food aid? It is the most it is the [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2896.7999999999997s)]
*  darkest thing you'll ever see in your life. It's like, because the people are so desperate for food, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2901.9199999999996s)]
*  and then the food comes in, and then they're like, they got to fight for it. You know, they're like [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2907.04s)]
*  all in there like wrestling, you know, like the way you see videos of, you know, like on, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2910.88s)]
*  I don't think I think the Cyber Monday kind of killed it. But if you remember years ago, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2916.8s)]
*  you see those Black Friday videos, where people are like trampling at a Walmart for a big screen TV. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2920.2400000000002s)]
*  But you look at that, you just kind of have contempt for the people because you're like, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2925.6s)]
*  Jesus, dude, you need a big screen TV this much. But this is food. These are hungry people looking [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2928.48s)]
*  for food. And then they just open fire on them. There's open fire and kill a whole bunch of [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2933.2s)]
*  starving innocent people. And so anyway, I bring that up. Just to mention that. How? Look, how do [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2937.2799999999997s)]
*  these guys like, even like to what Steve Bannon is just saying right there, it's like, like, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2946.7999999999997s)]
*  connect the two pieces here, man. It's like, so this is this regime that's being this like, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2952.08s)]
*  um, um, treacherous to the to the country that supports them. They're also sitting here just [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2958.4s)]
*  massacring these people still, still, dude, it is like, it is not October of 2023. We're in the [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2966.48s)]
*  summer of 2025. And they're still massacring these people. And we are, we're funding it. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2976.88s)]
*  We're funding and arming the thing. Like, I don't know, call me crazy. But I think if a country that [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2984.24s)]
*  is dependent on you is like totally undermining your, uh, your goals of peace and trying to pull [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=2992.0s)]
*  you into a catastrophic war, I think while they're doing that, we should not fund their genocide. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3000.48s)]
*  What? Oh, come on. I take a bold, radical stance because it is funny, uh, is that I've always gotten [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3006.72s)]
*  this for many, many years now. I've always gotten this thing, which I always find kind of interesting [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3014.3999999999996s)]
*  is, uh, a lot of people, like when I, when I would do, like when I do Rogan, like when I do big [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3020.8799999999997s)]
*  podcasts or people who are hearing me for the first time, or maybe they've heard me a couple [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3026.16s)]
*  times or they don't like know me that well, but they would say, uh, that, and I got this comment [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3030.88s)]
*  a lot. They would say that what they like about me is that I'm a, I'm a centrist. A lot of people [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3036.32s)]
*  would go like, I like that Dave comes on and just like, it's just common sense centrist stuff. And [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3043.12s)]
*  it's funny because I am not at all a centrist. Like that is not at all what I am. I am far more [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3048.1600000000003s)]
*  radical than just, I, I don't, I don't think there's anyone with the, uh, the exception of Michael [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3054.24s)]
*  Malice. Um, you know, Tom woods and guys like that, but at this point, like I do the, the rounds of [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3061.44s)]
*  like the big show is probably even more than, than those guys do. Um, but like, I don't, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3069.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know that there's anyone maybe, uh, you know, like depending on how you, you look at it [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3075.68s)]
*  some like, um, like Nick Fuentes maybe, but I'm trying to think like, who is actually more radical [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3081.12s)]
*  than me in their political views? I mean, I am, uh, I'm an ANCAP, I'm an anarchist. I don't, you [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3086.3199999999997s)]
*  know what I mean? I didn't know. I'm, I'm also like a pragmatic anarchist. So like, I don't think that [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3095.3599999999997s)]
*  like the governments are going to be abolished anytime soon and we'll, we'll just have a market [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3099.8399999999997s)]
*  economy for government. I'm not saying that's going to happen anytime soon, but like, I do [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3105.2799999999997s)]
*  think that is the correct position. And, um, but I would certainly, you know, I'm like, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3109.04s)]
*  I don't know, eliminate 90% of the federal government. If I had, you know, my way right [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3115.52s)]
*  now today, it's not a, that's not a centrist position or a moderate position. And yet I get [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3121.44s)]
*  called both those things a lot when I'll, I'll go on Rogan or like a big show, I get called moderate [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3127.12s)]
*  and a centrist. And I think what it is is that people go like, they go, they, they kind of use [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3133.68s)]
*  that as a placeholder for common sense. They just mean like, oh, he's not like a Democrat or [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3139.68s)]
*  Republican. He's not like a liberal or a conservative. He's just talking common sense. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3146.3999999999996s)]
*  And so that's kind of like the, but the funny thing is that it's like in, you know, like where [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3151.8399999999997s)]
*  they say in the, in the land of the blind, the man with one eye is King or something like that. It's [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3156.72s)]
*  like, well, in the land of an insane establishment, the radical is the only one talking common sense. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3161.28s)]
*  And so like what I'm saying here is actually, I guess, a radical proposal by today's standards, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3170.0s)]
*  but Hey, I think if a country is working to undermine you at every single turn, you shouldn't [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3176.48s)]
*  finance their genocide while they're doing that. Now that is actually a radical position to take [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3182.0800000000004s)]
*  in American politics today, but it is the most common sense position. There is nothing that makes [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3187.28s)]
*  more sense than that. It's just like the most obvious thing in the freaking world. This show [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3192.7200000000003s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. Any other thoughts on any of this stuff, Rob? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3246.1600000000003s)]
*  No, other than it's incredible how much of a whirlwind it is and the extent by which Donald [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3253.04s)]
*  Trump is more than happy to contradict himself within 24 hours. And the current situation makes [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3258.4s)]
*  little sense to me. And I'm fascinated to see how it plays out, particularly because [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3264.48s)]
*  Israel doesn't seem to want to be done with this. And it seems like Trump at the moment's [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3270.96s)]
*  taken a real line of like, no, that's it. But I don't know how Trump's going to treat the news [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3275.68s)]
*  if it comes out in the next couple of weeks that we didn't actually completely get rid of the [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3280.2400000000002s)]
*  Iranian nuclear program. I don't know exactly how he's going to play that other than to say, no, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3284.88s)]
*  I worked it out with them. They saw our might. And so they wouldn't dare do anything that they [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3289.68s)]
*  would have done a month ago. Yeah, that's there. No, that will be the interesting dynamic moving [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3294.64s)]
*  forward, assuming that this is even real and that we're not just tomorrow saying, oh, look, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3300.56s)]
*  we just bombed him again or something like that. It's really hard to say at this point. But I guess [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3306.08s)]
*  I would say kind of like in closing, I'd maybe just reaffirm that, you know, there's [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3311.12s)]
*  Donald Trump, if this holds, and this is kind of the end of this, let's say this does go down [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3319.2s)]
*  in the history books as the 12 day war, maybe we have to make name of the 13 day war now or [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3326.0s)]
*  whatever. But let's just say that was it. And it's done now. Then I will say like, thank God, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3330.24s)]
*  thank God that the Iranians allowed this off ramp. And thank God that Donald Trump took it. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3338.48s)]
*  It is despite how just unbelievably stupid pursuing this whole policy was, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3345.8399999999997s)]
*  but you know, it might be up there with it might be the greatest thing Donald Trump's ever done in [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3355.12s)]
*  his life is to push for a ceasefire now and to take that and not continue this war. But again, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3360.32s)]
*  I'm thrilled. It's so great that he did that. You know, the other possibilities were really, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3370.0800000000004s)]
*  really dark. And so it's really so great that he did that. In him doing that, he allows a lot of [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3375.6800000000003s)]
*  the Trump supporters who were not war hawks, but were essentially going to go along with Donald [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3382.56s)]
*  Trump, no matter what, you know, like, you know, the people I'm talking about who like would have [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3390.48s)]
*  if Donald Trump from the very beginning had said, no, we're not getting involved as Israel's fight, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3395.2799999999997s)]
*  not our fault. They would have been yeah, Donald Trump. And if Donald Trump had said we're invading [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3399.04s)]
*  the country and overthrowing the government, they'd have been like, yeah, Donald Trump, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3402.88s)]
*  like there are the people who are just going to follow him no matter what. For those people, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3405.84s)]
*  this gives them a neat little narrative. You know, it's like a nice, a nice little thing of [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3410.64s)]
*  a like where they can split the difference and say, which, you know, there's this thing with [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3416.72s)]
*  splitting the difference. Like, this is again, why I'm not a centrist, because it's, it's empty [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3420.48s)]
*  to be a centrist. But you know, this, this happens all the time where, you know, two people will be [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3425.92s)]
*  arguing and then a third person can come over and say, oh, the truth is somewhere in the middle. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3431.7599999999998s)]
*  And then they get to seem like they're the, you know, I'm see, I'm above it all. I'm not one of [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3437.04s)]
*  these partisans. I recognize that there's truth in both, but that's not always the case. You know, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3442.64s)]
*  like if there's somebody who's like arguing for the abolition of slavery, and then somebody else [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3447.28s)]
*  was arguing to continue slavery. And then you went, you know what, I see both of your points, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3452.48s)]
*  let's reduce slavery by 50%. Like you're not actually correct or above anything. It's sometimes [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3456.96s)]
*  there is a correct and incorrect choice here. But the narrative is there for them. They can sit here [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3462.48s)]
*  and say, they could say, well, look, you know, there were the hawks who wanted regime change. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3470.64s)]
*  There were the isolationists, as they call us, who wanted to not get involved at all. But Donald [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3477.68s)]
*  Trump threaded the needle. He walked the middle ground. He took out the Iranian nuclear sites and [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3483.28s)]
*  didn't get us in a stupid war. And so, you know, Donald Trump comes out winning the day. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3489.28s)]
*  Look, if you want to take that narrative, because you want to support Donald Trump, that's fine. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3498.5600000000004s)]
*  It's fairly easy for you. It's low hanging fruit at this point to take that and run with it. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3502.96s)]
*  But just, again, my job on the show is to tell the truth. And the truth is that that's just not [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3508.0800000000004s)]
*  right. That's just not right. What Donald Trump did here was reckless and erratic and incoherent. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3514.88s)]
*  It was a horrible decision for us to ever have even been in this to begin with. And the stuff [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3521.52s)]
*  that he's doing there, it's like, I'm sorry, but it is it's fun when Donald Trump is kind of goading [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3527.2000000000003s)]
*  the media and driving everybody crazy. It's fun when he's talking shit and when he's making people [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3535.12s)]
*  laugh. But when you just start, dude, he called for the evacuation of Tehran. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3540.8s)]
*  This city with nine million people in it. Those are real people, like real human beings, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3547.6000000000004s)]
*  just like you're a human being. You know, like how many women and children did he terrorize that day? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3553.04s)]
*  How many people were like trying to flee? How many, you know what I'm saying? Like this is not a game. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3559.04s)]
*  This isn't just like making Jim Acosta mad or something like that because you talk shit. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3563.84s)]
*  Like, you know, I don't know. It's like my wife was was getting nervous about like, you know, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3569.6000000000004s)]
*  the stuff where they're like, what if they do have sleeper cells or something? You're going into New [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3575.1200000000003s)]
*  York City today. Like, what's it going to be? You know, I hate that. And I tried to just calm her [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3578.8s)]
*  down like that. It's fine. Don't worry. Nothing's going to happen here because I don't like my wife [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3582.7200000000003s)]
*  worrying. I don't want there to be worries in her head. Like how many women and children did you [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3586.1600000000003s)]
*  just terrify over this thing? His tweet is incoherent tweets about regime change. And the truth is that [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3590.88s)]
*  the bottom line here has not changed. That you would he attacked a country. He launched a war [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3598.8s)]
*  against a country on a completely false pretense, a country that doesn't have nuclear weapons and [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3605.1200000000003s)]
*  wasn't pursuing nuclear weapons on behalf of another country who secretly does have nuclear [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3611.52s)]
*  weapons and also is committing. You know, this is a country in Israel who has in the last [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3618.5600000000004s)]
*  in the last year and a half, Israel has attacked Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3624.16s)]
*  and Yemen. Am I missing any in there? They've attacked six neighbors in the last year and a [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3638.96s)]
*  half. They are currently just slaughtering, genociding the Gazans. I know I didn't use that [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3648.16s)]
*  word for a long time, but we're way past that point now, dude. They're just absolutely like, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3656.48s)]
*  it's like there's a genocidal regime that has attacked six of its neighbors in the last year [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3660.64s)]
*  and a half. And he launched a war on behalf of them against on totally false pretense, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3666.3999999999996s)]
*  just totally made up. So, you know, if you, if you want to spin this as like Donald Trump did [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3674.08s)]
*  the right thing, you know what? In the end, he kind of did. So I'll grant you that I'm just [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3679.2000000000003s)]
*  not spinning it that way. I'm just going to tell the truth. And so as we've always done, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3683.36s)]
*  I'll hit Donald Trump when I think he's wrong on something. I'll praise him when I think he's [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3688.0s)]
*  right on something, but that's, that's how I'm seeing this right, right now. And so hope, look, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3691.28s)]
*  hopefully this sticks and this is the end of it, at least for now. And we move on to whatever the [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3699.04s)]
*  next controversy of tomorrow is. But at this point in time, I guess it's just a, we will say, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3704.64s)]
*  I don't know what else we can say about that. Scheduled chaos of a terror invading Canada, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3711.36s)]
*  reopening Alcatraz. Yeah, that's right. Tations. He can pivot back to, yes, he can pivot back to his [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3716.64s)]
*  awful spending bell. Now you're spending more money. We've got a lot going on. Yeah. Demonizing [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3723.6s)]
*  the best, uh, congressman in the country is you got to get, let's get back to your other agenda [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3730.88s)]
*  here, Donald Trump. Um, okay. Let's, uh, let's wrap up on that. Of course guys, as Rob mentioned, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3736.16s)]
*  he's all over the road. Go see him, the porch tour.com. That's right. That's the right website, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3741.44s)]
*  port store.com. And then a one show at the secret group, which you can find on their website. But [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3746.4s)]
*  other than that, I still have another 30 dates, uh, going strong all summer. I listed off the most [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3750.48s)]
*  recent dates at the beginning of the show, but, uh, hitting, hitting a lot more territory. So [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3755.6s)]
*  he didn't hear an area, go to porch tour.com. I'll probably probably be there at some point. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3759.68s)]
*  Hell yeah. And of course Rob also has a, a new podcast over, uh, with zero hedge. You can get [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3763.84s)]
*  that at the zero hedge, uh, YouTube channel. Um, I, I just did a debate for zero hedge a couple [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3770.08s)]
*  days ago and I will be debating, uh, Dinesh D'Souza, um, on Thursday night, I believe. I'm [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3776.32s)]
*  not sure if it's, I'm debating him on Thursday night. I'm not sure if they're airing it live. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3783.52s)]
*  What's the debate prompt? Well, you know, I'm not exact. They said to me, cause you know, like we [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3787.44s)]
*  had me and Dinesh D'Souza had gone back a little bit and, uh, I was pretty, I forget exactly, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3794.32s)]
*  you know, I tend to not be too, you know, aggressive on Twitter unless someone's kind [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3800.0800000000004s)]
*  of shitty with me. And then I try to be more vicious than they are, but I was pretty vicious [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3805.36s)]
*  with him and I don't remember exactly. I think he started it, but I'd have to go back and look. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3810.56s)]
*  Is it, well, we were arguing over the war and around, we were arguing over the war and around [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3814.48s)]
*  and then, um, uh, you know, he, then he did kind of end it. We was like, why don't we like have a [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3819.04s)]
*  conversation or a debate in a cordial and productive manner? And I was like, okay, fine, I'll do that. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3825.28s)]
*  But then they said to me, they were like, you want to debate Dinesh D'Souza on Thursday? I was like, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3830.1600000000003s)]
*  sure, I'll do that. And then they were like, okay, the debate is about, um, supporting Donald Trump. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3833.6s)]
*  And I was like, well, I was like, don't make that the center of the debate. Like I'll, I'll argue [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3838.64s)]
*  why I'm not supporting them or whatever, but like, I'm not, you know what I mean? Like I'm not really [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3844.16s)]
*  trying to convince people not to support Donald Trump or to support Donald Trump. There's no [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3848.16s)]
*  election right now. Like it doesn't matter, you know? So like, let's, let's debate over a policy [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3852.4s)]
*  over an issue. And I have, I'm not sure what they said, but it'll be about the war and Iran and [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3856.48s)]
*  foreign policy in general and stuff like that. So, um, I'm not sure exactly if they're going to [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3860.8s)]
*  have like a resolution or something, but anyway, I'll be debating there and Rob's, uh, new podcast [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3865.1200000000003s)]
*  is, is out there, uh, regularly. So go check that out. All right. Thank you guys for listening. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3869.92s)]
*  Catch you next time. Peace. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEnAIgbkDZ8&t=3874.0800000000004s)]
