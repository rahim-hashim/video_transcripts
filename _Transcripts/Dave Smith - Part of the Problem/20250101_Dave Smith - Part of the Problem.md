*  Hello, hello, what's up everybody welcome to the first part of the problem of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=0.0s)]
*  2025 it is New Year's Day as I am recording this I am going solo for this episode Rob is out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=13.24s)]

*  This might this might be a little bit of a shorter episode [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=29.16s)]
*  Because number one I'm solo and number two. I'm an old man and I'm tired from New Year's Eve last night [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=33.4s)]
*  Thank you very much to everybody who came out for the shows here at the dojo of comedy the great venue [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=38.84s)]

*  With Robbie the fire Bernstein coming with me on I think almost all of these gigs so comic Dave Smith comm [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=64.8s)]
*  For for all of the ticket links some of them are some of the links are up [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=72.08s)]
*  There's a few that still need to be added, but check that out. I will be coming to a city near you at some point this year [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=76.76s)]
*  I'm sure [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=83.04s)]
*  Okay, so I have a couple things that I wanted to talk about today and then if we have time I will [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=84.56s)]
*  I will take some questions from the chat [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=91.88s)]
*  I guess number one [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=96.08s)]
*  We should we should talk about there was this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=98.92s)]
*  horror horrible [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=102.2s)]
*  Night [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=104.2s)]
*  Last night it's it's being reported right now that I think I believe 15 people were killed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=107.12s)]
*  Many more were injured a few police officers were shot [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=113.76s)]
*  Apparently this guy [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=119.56s)]
*  Drove a truck into a crowded street in New Orleans and as we've seen over [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=121.36s)]
*  The last decade or so there's in Europe there's been a few of these but this is a new [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=127.88s)]
*  Attack of choice by terrorists, you know in in crowded streets cars can do a lot of damage and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=136.76s)]
*  There's you know post 9-eleven there's been some very simple [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=143.76s)]
*  Changes that were made that made it very difficult for another 9-eleven to happen [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=148.6s)]
*  And I don't I'm not referring to anything like the Department of Homeland Security being created or the TSA grope and grandma's or anything [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  like that simply [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=159.73999999999998s)]
*  Like they locked the cockpit door now like just little things like that where it's like [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's gonna be really hard and then one of the major major things that allowed 9-eleven to happen [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  That just simply was was over after 9-eleven is that the old and I'm you know old enough to remember this but the old [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=174.06s)]
*  Thinking the the wisdom pre 9-eleven was that if there is a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  hostage type situation a plane being hijacked or something like that what you want to do is stay calm and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=190.94s)]
*  do do what they say and hopefully a negotiator is going to get on the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  Phone or whatever with them and then they'll be able to work out some type of deal and land the plane and convinced [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=203.73999999999998s)]
*  It wasn't really in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  the popular consciousness that this was going to be a suicide mission where they were going to turn this plane into a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=211.73999999999998s)]
*  missile in effect and so [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=219.14s)]
*  essentially [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  If you were to ever try to hijack a plane again one of the major problems you'd have is that I mean again the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  9-eleven hijackers I believe had like box cutters and things like that. It's not like they were you know had machine guns or something and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=229.22s)]
*  People aren't just gonna sit there and take it anymore because they know they're gonna die anyway, so they might as well try so [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=236.18s)]
*  Good luck, you know getting a plane again. It's gonna be very difficult [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=241.98s)]
*  however [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=245.82s)]
*  How the hell do you stop people from? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=247.3s)]
*  Plowing into a group of people in a car. I mean that's just very very difficult to do and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=250.1s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why there there have been several attacks of this nature in Europe [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=257.02s)]
*  And we just had this this horrible one [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=260.98s)]
*  Last night on New Year's Eve, obviously that I mean I [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=264.1s)]
*  Information is still coming out [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=268.98s)]
*  But pretty clearly seems to be the day was chosen for a symbolic reason and that is one of the major points of terrorism is to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=270.18s)]
*  to affect [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=276.9s)]
*  Psychologically the way people live their lives and to create a situation where you don't feel comfortable [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=279.14s)]
*  To go out in crowds and on a holiday or something like that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=284.26s)]
*  This just happened obviously last night [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=289.06s)]
*  What's being reported right now is that evidently they the claim is that the guy had [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=292.78s)]
*  like an Isis flag [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  Then I I did see some other people reporting that he was a you know [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=302.17999999999995s)]
*  I'm let me look back up at this because I saw it here, but it would that he was either [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=308.4s)]
*  I can't remember if it was a former police or former military one of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=314.46s)]
*  One of those okay. Yeah according a Carol [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=319.1s)]
*  Mark Markowitz. I'm sorry if I'm saying your name wrong Carol because I know you and we've done a few cable news shows together [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=323.54s)]
*  But she tweeted just about an hour ago [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=331.26000000000005s)]
*  Breaking the man who rammed his car into people in New Orleans last night is named [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=335.62s)]
*  Shams said Din Jabbar [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=341.62s)]
*  Born and raised in Texas served in the US Army [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, this is [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=347.5s)]
*  If the reports of him flying an Isis flag are true, then it would seem like what we're looking at is one of these [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=349.5s)]
*  you know home [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=357.26s)]
*  bred [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=359.02s)]
*  Was the term I'm looking for is eluding me at the moment [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=361.74s)]
*  But essentially one of these people who took up the cause like a like a Muslim who's American [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=364.38s)]
*  Who took up the cause and and sided with? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=369.74s)]
*  Isis and so I think that's the thing [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=373.18s)]
*  Isis [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=376.3s)]
*  Look I'll just say this I [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=378.38000000000005s)]
*  You know what actually Natalie if you wouldn't mind if you could just if you could pull up this clip pull up the which [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=381.5s)]
*  Is I love any excuse to play this but if you just YouTube Ron Paul Giuliani moment [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  And then I'll play that clip here in a way because I do think it is relevant to this conversation [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=395.06s)]
*  So what I was just gonna say is that I [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=400.96s)]
*  And I apologize for for regular listeners who have seen, you know heard this before I'm gonna make you watch it again [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=404.88s)]
*  But it's it's okay. You can never you can never watch the great Ron Paul too much [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=410.08s)]
*  But you know [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=414.08s)]
*  I I have been saying now for quite a while on the show that I am really concerned about the risk of terrorism [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=415.44s)]
*  Going forward and al-qaeda Isis like operations again [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=423.12s)]
*  I don't think they're gonna be able to pull off 9-eleven style things, but [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=426.56s)]
*  There's a lot, you know, I'm not trying to give anyone any ideas [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=431.36s)]
*  but there's just a lot of other things that you can do and it is it is [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=434.08s)]
*  next to impossible to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=438.8s)]
*  Constantly be on guard against any act of terrorism [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=441.56s)]
*  Especially when you have a situation like what appears to be the case with this guy where you have an American who is you know? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=445.16s)]
*  Who sides with you know Isis or al-qaeda and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=452.02s)]
*  I think of you know, the reason why I've been saying this for a while [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=456.74s)]
*  And I'm not saying that this is true in in 100% of the cases or even in this most recent one [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=460.74s)]
*  I mean, we really don't know we don't have a lot of a lot of information, but [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=465.78s)]
*  I'm sorry one second [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=472.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Show me it's it's anyone that says Ron Paul [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=474.65999999999997s)]
*  Giuliani moment should be the right one. Yeah that one hold on if you go up right there that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=477.9s)]
*  That one right there. Yes, that's perfect. So you get that right here. Hold on one second. We'll play but that's that's perfect [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=482.21999999999997s)]
*  So I the the point is that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=487.82s)]
*  What motivates terrorism [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=492.78s)]
*  Is the is an important factor and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=496.78s)]
*  it's always very tricky when you talk about this because [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=500.46s)]
*  What what people who don't want to hear this will do is they will just drive the iq of the conversation down [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=503.82s)]
*  The same thing when you're talking about the the war in ukraine like if you say [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=511.02000000000004s)]
*  As as is the title of scott horton's great new book it provoked if you say that the west provoked [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=516.54s)]
*  The war in ukraine then everybody who doesn't want to hear that their counter is always so your [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=523.58s)]
*  Saying it's justified which is just like two completely different claims and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=530.54s)]
*  Understanding what motivates [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=536.38s)]
*  An evil act does not mean that you don't think the act is evil [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=539.26s)]
*  Anyway, the reason I wanted to pull up this ron paul clip just in because I think it's it's super relevant to this conversation [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=544.86s)]
*  but also that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=550.62s)]
*  Part of the reason why i'm always kind of aware of this stuff is that this was my moment [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=552.62s)]
*  Now it's not unique to me. There were a lot of people who found ron paul from this moment, but literally I would this was in 2007 [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=557.26s)]
*  um, so 18 years ago and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=563.74s)]
*  I was just a kid. They when I say kid, I was you know, 23 or whatever. Um [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=567.9000000000001s)]
*  I was a young person and I was not [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=575.26s)]
*  Very interested in politics. I was somebody I didn't know I was a politician [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  I was somebody I didn't know a lot about this stuff [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=584.38s)]
*  I had never it wasn't like I grew up like immersed in all of the stuff that i'm obsessed with now [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=587.9799999999999s)]
*  I was just a kid. Um, I mean I was kind of loosely interested in some things [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=593.9s)]
*  It was it was an interesting time in the country. It was 9 11 had happened. Uh, uh six years earlier [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=598.4599999999999s)]
*  Uh, we were already in the war in afghanistan and the war in iraq both wars were going very [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=606.14s)]
*  Very bad [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=612.06s)]
*  And I just happened to be I remember I went I went to my mother's house [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=613.3399999999999s)]
*  And I happened I don't know if we had dinner or something like that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=618.3s)]
*  but I went to my mother's house and we happened to be watching the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  Republican primary debate and this was the the year that ultimately barack obama became president [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=625.4s)]
*  But I happened to be watching this debate and I saw this moment and I was like, whoa, who the fuck is that guy? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=631.26s)]
*  That's really interesting and and what was so much more interesting to me people today maybe can't appreciate this but [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=637.58s)]
*  At the time the republicans were the were the war party and the democrats at least posed as the anti-war party [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=643.82s)]
*  And so the fact that this was a republican from texas [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=651.66s)]
*  Like the sitting president george w bush a republican from texas who was making this point [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=656.0600000000001s)]
*  To me was just fascinating [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=661.98s)]
*  I couldn't you know now that I mentioned I couldn't think of a better way to start the new year than to play this [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=663.34s)]
*  So let's just let's play the ron paul with what got dubbed ultimately the juliani moment [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=667.6600000000001s)]
*  And here's the point ron paul was making 18 years ago [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=672.3000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Paul, I believe you are the only man on the stage who opposes the war in iraq who would bring the troops home [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=676.22s)]
*  As quickly as almost immediately, sir [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=683.1800000000001s)]
*  Are you out of step with your party is your party out of step with the rest of the world if either of those is [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=685.82s)]
*  The case why are you seeking its nomination? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=690.7800000000001s)]
*  well, I think the party has lost its way because the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=693.98s)]
*  Conservative wing of the republican party always advocated a non-interventionist foreign policy senator robert taff didn't want to be in nato [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=698.2s)]
*  george bush won the election in year 2000 campaigning on a [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  Humble foreign policy no [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=710.62s)]
*  Nation-building no policing of the world [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=713.02s)]
*  Republicans were elected to end the korean war the republicans were elected to end the vietnam war [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=716.0400000000001s)]
*  There's a strong tradition of being anti-war [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=721.34s)]
*  Uh in the republican party it is the constitutional position [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=724.38s)]
*  It is the advice of the founders to follow a non-interventionist foreign policy stay out of entangling alliances be friends with countries [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=728.22s)]
*  Negotiate and talk with them and trade with them [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=735.66s)]
*  So I you can already see look there's if you could imagine right because this is a debate [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=738.78s)]
*  I think there's like nine or ten people on the stage and every one of them is just being a politician [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=743.66s)]
*  You know, they're just like talking in dumb slogans and whatever and so already in this moment [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=748.86s)]
*  I was just fascinated like I was like, oh this guy's like actually just a wise [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=753.34s)]
*  Older guy who's like talking about history and making compelling arguments and like I just so already [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=757.58s)]
*  I was just kind of interested. It was like whoa, this is different like one of these things is not like the other [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=763.98s)]
*  So anyway, you keep playing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=769.0200000000001s)]
*  Just think of the tremendous improvement [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=775.0200000000001s)]
*  Uh relationships with vietnam we lost 60 000 men we came home in defeat [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=777.66s)]
*  Now we go over there and be in wet invest in in vietnam [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=783.42s)]
*  So there's a lot of a lot of merit to the advice of the founders and following the constitution [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=786.86s)]
*  And my argument is that we shouldn't go to war so carelessly when we do the wars don't end [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=791.74s)]
*  Congress me you don't think that changed with the 9 11 attack sir [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  What changed the non-interventionist policies? No [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=802.7s)]
*  Non-intervention was a major contributing factor. Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=806.8599999999999s)]
*  They they attack us because we've been over there. We've been bombing iraq for 10 years [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=812.54s)]
*  We've been in the middle east. I think reagan was right. We don't understand the irrationality of middle eastern politics [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=817.42s)]
*  So right now we're building an embassy in iraq. It's bigger than the vatican. We're building 14 permanent bases [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=824.6999999999999s)]
*  What would we say here if china was doing this in our country or in the gulf of mexico? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=831.42s)]
*  We would be objecting we need to look at what we do from the perspective of what would happen if somebody else did it [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=835.82s)]
*  To us are you suggesting we invited the 9 11 attack, sir? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=841.18s)]
*  Let's pause it right here. So um again [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=845.1s)]
*  It what was so stark to me about this. It's weird. I haven't watched this in a while, but [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=848.38s)]
*  As I watch it back, it's like I completely understand why I got sucked in and I was so fascinated by this moment [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=853.34s)]
*  It's not over yet. We'll get to some of the really interesting parts here, but this literally I just got obsessed [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=858.62s)]
*  I was like, who is this guy? I have to know everything about him and I ended up like I I [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=863.42s)]
*  Think I went and bought one of his books [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=868.62s)]
*  Which was like at the time was revolution was was the first ron paul book that I bought [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=870.9399999999999s)]
*  And I got it. I think it barnes and nobles or something like that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=875.7399999999999s)]
*  um, and I was just it and then I just like literally just fell down the rabbit hole and became the [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=878.62s)]
*  libertarian autist, you know and love today, but [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=885.0799999999999s)]
*  It was one of the things that was so interesting is that this this point was so [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=888.38s)]
*  Overwhelmingly compelling like it was like oh my god. Yeah, you know like that's really interesting and it's hard [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=891.3199999999999s)]
*  I think for younger people to even understand because if you weren't around in that time that the entire line [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=898.3s)]
*  Which was accepted by everyone by the way, but the entire line that the bush administration was pushing [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=904.9399999999999s)]
*  Since 9 11. This is now that was in 2001. This is six years later in 2007 was that they they hate us for our freedom [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=910.38s)]
*  That's why they attacked us on 9 11. So they hate us for our freedom [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=917.34s)]
*  and [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=921.26s)]
*  that [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=923.02s)]
*  If that's your operating system, then you're like, well, I guess there's no other option than to kill all these people [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=924.38s)]
*  I mean what? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=929.34s)]
*  They want to come kill us just because we're free. What are you going to do? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=930.62s)]
*  And then ron paul's up here just making the point that okay. Listen, no, that's not it [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=933.5s)]
*  They hate us for what we're doing to them [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=937.8199999999999s)]
*  And how would we feel if anyone was doing that to us? We'd probably be ready to go kill them too [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=940.38s)]
*  Now again, that's not none of the is justifying [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=945.66s)]
*  Terrorism is just saying look we got to be smart about what we're doing and the reaction that is fairly predictable [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=949.42s)]
*  That comes with that [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=957.18s)]
*  The other thing that was already so stark and believe me it's about to get a lot dumber [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=958.78s)]
*  But the follow-up questions from the moderators were so I mean, they're just like 40 IQ points below ron paul's point [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=962.6999999999999s)]
*  He's saying hey listen, you know, this was the advice of the founders [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=970.38s)]
*  This is what the conservative wing of the republicans always believed that [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=974.38s)]
*  Entangling alliances and and looking for monsters to destroy around the world would end up having all of these negative outcomes [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=978.12s)]
*  And then the response from the moderator is you don't think that all change with 9 11 [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=985.18s)]
*  like [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=990.06s)]
*  like the laws of logic no longer exist or something like that because we got hit on 9 11 and [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=991.1s)]
*  Even the follow-up question. Well, and then the the second follow-up question is so you're saying we invited the attack [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=996.9399999999999s)]
*  That's like [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1004.06s)]
*  What like it's just it's just always trying to dumb down the point because nobody really wants to grapple with what he's saying [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1005.66s)]
*  All right. Let's let's keep playing [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1012.22s)]
*  Are you suggesting we invited the 9 11 attack sir [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1016.22s)]
*  I'm suggesting that we listen to the people who attacked us and the reason they did it and they are delighted that we're over there [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1019.58s)]
*  Because osama ben laudan has said I am glad you're over on our sand [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1027.02s)]
*  Because we can target you so much easier they have already now since that time [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1031.18s)]
*  3 400 of our men and I don't think it was necessary [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1035.8200000000002s)]
*  May I make a comment on that? That's really an extraordinary statement [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1039.74s)]
*  That's an extraordinary statement as someone who lived through the attack of september 11 that we invited the attack [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1043.5800000000002s)]
*  Because we were attacking iraq. I don't think i've ever heard that before and i've heard some pretty absurd explanations for september 11 [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1049.02s)]
*  Okay, so pause it here [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1058.06s)]
*  This is just I mean, it's just everything about this is so beautiful. It's really bringing me back to my roots here. So [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1061.26s)]
*  Rudy giuliani then of course now at it's hard to remember this at the time [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1067.18s)]
*  But rudy giuliani was actually I don't remember if dirt at this debate [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1070.7s)]
*  But rudy giuliani was leading in the polls for quite a while [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1074.46s)]
*  He was the favorite to be the republican nominee for quite a while. Um, he ended up falling apart [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1077.42s)]
*  uh, I think in part because of this moment but [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1082.94s)]
*  Not entirely [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1086.46s)]
*  Um, and john mccain ended up ultimately winning the the nominee [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1087.8200000000002s)]
*  He was not the favorite at all until like very late into the primary. But anyway [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1091.26s)]
*  So rudy giuliani takes this moment to go. Um [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1097.3400000000001s)]
*  To say, you know, did he just say [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1102.6200000000001s)]
*  They did 9 11 because we were attacking iraq. I've you know, i've never heard that before are his words [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1105.74s)]
*  And i've heard some pretty ridiculous [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1112.22s)]
*  Um explanations for for 9 11 now what is so [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1114.22s)]
*  Amazing about this if you know anything, which by the way, I did not know at the time [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1119.18s)]
*  but then you know, as I said, I fell down the rabbit hole and got obsessed with this stuff, but um [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1123.34s)]
*  Literally [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1129.4s)]
*  this was [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1130.78s)]
*  the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1132.38s)]
*  In osama bin laden's declaration of war on america in osama bin laden's open letter to america [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1133.26s)]
*  In almost every interview that he was in it was that this this was one of his stated grievances [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1139.98s)]
*  Constantly it was always the grievances that osama bin laden state like it was a bunch of jihadist stuff, you know [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1145.88s)]
*  Allah akbar and and you know sharia law and you know all the all the islamist stuff and then it was like [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1152.7s)]
*  Okay [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1160.6200000000001s)]
*  Why are we at war with you? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1161.9s)]
*  Because you are at war with us and here's what you've done and the list was [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1163.74s)]
*  Um, you have uh military bases in our holy land in saudi arabia [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1168.8600000000001s)]
*  You uh, you support israel in in their ethnic cleansing and slaughtering of the palestinians [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1174.14s)]
*  Yeah, it was going on before just this year [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1181.3400000000001s)]
*  um and um and you you prop up dictators [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1183.74s)]
*  In the region it was just filled with american sock puppets and that you were slaughtered that you slaughter muslim [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1188.94s)]
*  You know innocent men women and children and specifically in iraq now just to be clear here [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1195.66s)]
*  the bases [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1202.14s)]
*  That are in saudi arabia that he's complaining about were put there for what was called the dual containment strategy to contain both iraq [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1203.66s)]
*  And iran and they were what was used those bases were used not only in the first [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1211.74s)]
*  war in iraq under george hw bush [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1218.78s)]
*  But then also in the bill clinton years when they put the full blockade around the country and they had massive bombing campaigns [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1220.7s)]
*  Um and killed many many people. I don't know [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1226.3s)]
*  You know there was the un estimated that 500 000 children had died as a result of the uh, the blockade around the country [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1229.98s)]
*  Um children dying from starvation and malnutrition. I've seen many people argue and I think quite convincingly that that number was [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1237.42s)]
*  It was drastically inflated. Uh, so I don't know exactly what the numbers are but like [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1244.3s)]
*  It was at minimum in the tens of thousands of children who died there and and quite possibly in the hundreds of thousands and [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1249.0200000000002s)]
*  regardless [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1257.16s)]
*  It's just for rudy. Giuliani to be bragging that he's never heard this before [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1258.6200000000001s)]
*  All he's saying is he's never read or listened to anything osama bin laden said it's like it's stunning [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1263.9s)]
*  The ignorance that he's so proud of that by the way [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1269.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying because osama bin laden said it's right you could have an argument but for your argument to be [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1272.38s)]
*  I've never heard this before is absurd. However, because this is the republic. This is the george w bush [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1278.06s)]
*  republican primary [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1285.0s)]
*  this gets a [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1286.7s)]
*  Thunderous round of applause like the crowd goes crazy for this because they were all just so stupid and drunk on war on terrorism [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1288.46s)]
*  Nonsense, and so ron paul's like over here giving a history lesson or making this philosophical argument and then rudy [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1296.76s)]
*  Giuliani goes, you know, i've heard some ridiculous stuff [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1302.78s)]
*  I never heard no nothing like that before and the crowd goes nuts and now because rudy. Giuliani is a politician [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1305.02s)]
*  He's like, ooh the crowd just went nuts for my reaction. I just smacked this guy down [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1311.3400000000001s)]
*  So he takes it a step further [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1315.9s)]
*  And this moment to me [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1317.9s)]
*  I literally I mean i'm not exaggerating. I say this moment changed my life and let's play the the rest of it [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1320.14s)]
*  I [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1325.6s)]
*  Would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that congressman [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1335.12s)]
*  I believe very sincerely that the that the cia is correct when they teach and and talk about blowback [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1343.12s)]
*  when we went into [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1350.32s)]
*  iran in [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1352.08s)]
*  1953 and installed the shaw [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1353.58s)]
*  Yes, there was blowback [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1355.8999999999999s)]
*  The reaction to that was the taking of our hostages and that persists [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1357.5s)]
*  And if we ignore that we ignore that our own risks that if we think that we can do what we want around the world [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1361.5s)]
*  And not incite hatred then we then we have a problem. They don't come here to attack us because we're rich and we're free [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1367.58s)]
*  They come and they attack us because we're over there [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1375.58s)]
*  I mean, what would we think if we were if other foreign countries were doing that to us? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1378.86s)]
*  Can I have 30 seconds, please? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1383.58s)]
*  So that's that was the moment there I just thought I remember [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1387.34s)]
*  And again, I think it's kind of hard. Maybe some of this is lost on like younger people who weren't there for that time [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1390.62s)]
*  But there was something about when he goes and by the way the audio on that clip was not [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1397.74s)]
*  great, uh, but the the applause for juliani in the room was thunderous and [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1402.78s)]
*  When he goes I I demand that ron paul apologize for that and say he didn't really mean that what [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1408.22s)]
*  You just expected out of any politician, especially when they've lost the crowd [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1415.18s)]
*  Is to apologize or at least in some sense walk it back or go kind of like well [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1420.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, no, I didn't really mean it like that [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1426.7s)]
*  And of course we're the good guys and they're the bad guys and of course, but you know and ron paul just uh, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1428.38s)]
*  His response was I very sincerely believe [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1433.1000000000001s)]
*  That when the cia talks about blowback they are correct by the way blowback was a term coined by the cia [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1436.8600000000001s)]
*  Which is just an interesting little you know [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1443.3400000000001s)]
*  Bit of information on top of this because they're very well aware that their covert actions have unintended consequences [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1445.98s)]
*  They're very aware of that and of course by the way, and then he just gives a history lesson [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1452.7800000000002s)]
*  Which was amazing and the job that was news to me at the time that we in 1953 the cia overthrew the democratically elected government [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1456.38s)]
*  Of iran and installed the shah [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1464.46s)]
*  And that you're like, oh, that's why iran hates us [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1466.7800000000002s)]
*  That's why they still hate us because they lived for what was it from 53 to 1979 [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1469.98s)]
*  Under a dictatorship that was imposed on them by a foreign country and when ron paul goes like how would we feel? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1477.2600000000002s)]
*  How would we feel about that? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1483.98s)]
*  You think about like all the russia gate nonsense when they tried to say that donald trump was like a russian spy [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1485.66s)]
*  Just try to imagine for a second he really was [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1491.82s)]
*  Like try try to imagine that it really just was the truth that russia came over here and overthrew our government and installed [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1494.62s)]
*  their [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1502.06s)]
*  chosen government [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1503.1799999999998s)]
*  You imagine the type of like uh hatred that we would have toward them [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1504.54s)]
*  And so anyway, just this moment to me was amazing and it it really had a huge impact on on my life [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1509.74s)]
*  And then of course I dove deep and read all the ron paul's books and then I read all the rothbard and mises and tom woods [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1516.7800000000002s)]
*  and peter schiff and like all these guys and [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1522.38s)]
*  The anyway, essentially the point is here is the reason that i've been very concerned about um, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1526.3000000000002s)]
*  Terrorism here in america is that [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1533.2600000000002s)]
*  If ron paul's right about this, which I sure think he is [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1536.6200000000001s)]
*  I just think it's like an overwhelming argument and there's been great books written about this stuff [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1540.7s)]
*  but like the thing [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1545.66s)]
*  Whatever, even if you want to say that like osama ben laden himself was just a madman and was just [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1547.66s)]
*  You know, which clearly he was and he was evil and he was quite willing to kill innocent people [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1553.18s)]
*  But the point is that [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1558.14s)]
*  In order for him to recruit people who were actually willing to give their own lives in order to hurt somebody else [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1560.22s)]
*  You got to think like what makes somebody do that? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1568.78s)]
*  Like what [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1571.98s)]
*  and and this was never that hard for me to like wrap my head around but like [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1573.18s)]
*  What would push someone to the point where they were willing? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1578.0600000000002s)]
*  To to give their own life just to maybe hurt you and it's real easy to sit there and say oh [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1581.42s)]
*  It's their religion. It's because they're they're such religious fanatics. It's like [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1587.26s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of religious fanatics throughout the world including muslims, you know [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1592.14s)]
*  um who just don't do that [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1597.66s)]
*  And just don't do that. I think indonesia has the biggest muslim population in the world [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1599.66s)]
*  We're not getting a lot of indonesian terrorists [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1604.22s)]
*  And where were the terrorists from? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1606.94s)]
*  They were saudis and egyptians [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1609.3400000000001s)]
*  They lived in two countries under american sock puppet dictators, you know, they hid out in afghanistan, but none of them were were from there and [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1613.42s)]
*  You know look you [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1623.02s)]
*  This was another point that the pap you cannon made I remember there's this video of pap you cannon [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1625.98s)]
*  That was like the timing really lines up. It was right around 15 years before [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1630.86s)]
*  october 7th and um [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1637.16s)]
*  He was talking about some israeli [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1639.74s)]
*  I can't remember which one but some israeli operation that killed like a few hundred palestinians including like a a bunch of children [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1641.9s)]
*  And he was like, where do you think the brothers? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1649.58s)]
*  Uh of those like girls who got killed where are they going to be in 15 years? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1652.7s)]
*  What do you think they're going to be doing? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1657.3400000000001s)]
*  Because if you're really asking yourself what would get you to that point no matter what your religion is [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1658.8600000000001s)]
*  What would get you to that point where you're you're happy to die to maybe go kill some of them? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1664.38s)]
*  Try watching your little sister get killed in front of you [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1670.14s)]
*  Try watching your kids or your mother or your grandmother or someone you really care about watch them get slaughtered by some some other country [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1672.46s)]
*  That might be the thing that gets you there [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1679.42s)]
*  Anyway, the point is that for the entire last year [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1681.98s)]
*  america has been [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1685.66s)]
*  I don't even I was going to say propping up, but it's really much more than that. I mean america has been [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1689.3400000000001s)]
*  Facilitating the slaughter of the palestinians for well over a year now [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1695.4s)]
*  Absolutely, just simply would not could not happen without u.s support [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1699.8200000000002s)]
*  and that is exactly the thing that motivates these guys and like [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1704.0600000000002s)]
*  I I do think this is a real concern. Um going forward and it is you know, um, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1709.1s)]
*  Michael schumer [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1715.98s)]
*  Um, I mean I might be saying that his last name wrong, but something real close to that schweimer [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1717.58s)]
*  Uh, he was the cia, uh the head of the bin laden unit in the cia and I believe he went a little bit nutty [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1723.02s)]
*  More recently. I'm not sure about that. I shouldn't say that without really remembering [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1731.6599999999999s)]
*  I remember thinking he became a little bit of a kook I could be wrong, but [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1735.5s)]
*  He uh wrote a couple books on this topic. He testified before congress about it [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1739.26s)]
*  I mean he was he was the head of the bin laden unit at the cia, right? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1743.66s)]
*  Like he was the guy who was in charge of dealing with terrorism [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1747.5800000000002s)]
*  before 9 11 [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1752.38s)]
*  and [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1754.38s)]
*  He flat-out testified before congress and wrote in his book that he was just like look [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1755.3400000000001s)]
*  We got to be honest with the american people here [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1760.14s)]
*  And he was like look that our military presence in the middle east and our support of israel comes with this cost [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1762.46s)]
*  The cost is terrorism [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1769.8200000000002s)]
*  And if we don't wish to pay that cost then okay [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1771.98s)]
*  And if we do wish to pay that cost then okay [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1774.7800000000002s)]
*  Like if you if you're saying that the cost is worth it or something like that then all right [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1777.0200000000002s)]
*  But let's be honest about that. Let's be honest about what is going on here [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1782.6200000000001s)]
*  And it's like pap you can and always said terrorism is the price of empire [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1787.1000000000001s)]
*  And if you don't wish to pay that price, you got to get rid of the empire [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1791.1799999999998s)]
*  and we're we haven't done that and donald trump and his his [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1794.78s)]
*  Foreign policy picks certainly don't seem to be moving in that direction at all [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1800.1399999999999s)]
*  If anything, it's going to be more and more unconditional support for israel [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1804.78s)]
*  And I do think that this is the cost that is going to be associated with that [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1808.9399999999998s)]
*  so [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1813.4199999999998s)]
*  Sorry, if that's not a very cheery optimistic message for uh for the first podcast of the year [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1814.6999999999998s)]
*  But that is that is how I feel. I I am really concerned about this stuff and I do think um, you know scott [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1819.42s)]
*  Scott horton has said who's you know, the best foreign policy expert in the country. Uh, he has said [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1826.78s)]
*  many times that it it's his like thank god osama ben laden is dead because [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1833.9s)]
*  The like he really was I I don't think there's anyone else in the you know, radical sunni world [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1840.14s)]
*  Who has quite the cache that he had? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1846.9399999999998s)]
*  um [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1849.6599999999999s)]
*  We'll see, you know, who knows but [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1850.78s)]
*  He really was the guy who would have been able to like organize and inspire these type of attacks [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1853.7399999999998s)]
*  but that doesn't mean they can't happen without him and as we've seen in [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1858.2199999999998s)]
*  Um in europe and the united states of america even since osama bin laden's death there have been pretty awful terrorist attacks [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1861.58s)]
*  And it appears we just uh got another one last night [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1868.06s)]

*  um that I am [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1946.3799999999999s)]
*  loosely following i'm not like super up to [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1948.6999999999998s)]
*  Up on the exact details, but it seems as if [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1952.2199999999998s)]
*  Yesterday on new year's eve over on twitter. There was a little bit of drama where there seems to have been [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1955.8s)]
*  um not I I was going to say the word [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1964.22s)]
*  Deplatforming but I don't think that's actually correct. I from what I understand [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1967.24s)]
*  I don't think anybody's actually been kicked off the platform, but evidently there was um, a a group of [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1970.46s)]
*  twitter accounts x accounts that got um [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1978.0600000000002s)]
*  Demonetized and had their blue checks [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1981.96s)]
*  taken away from them [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1985.18s)]
*  um the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1987.18s)]
*  People here. Hold on. I think I have um [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1988.78s)]
*  some of the lists here it [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1991.18s)]
*  Sorry, let me just pull this up. So I have uh [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1994.38s)]
*  it looks like um [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=1998.0600000000002s)]
*  Uh myron gains from the uh fresh and fit podcast. Uh jake shields. Um [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2000.22s)]
*  Uh solomon ahmed [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2007.8200000000002s)]
*  Stu peters dr. Lupus, uh, and I think a few others I believe I thought nick fuentes might have lost his uh [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2010.78s)]
*  His blue check too, but i'm not seeing his name [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2019.18s)]
*  On this particular tweet. Let me uh check that right now [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2022.14s)]
*  Yeah, well, he doesn't have a blue check mark on there. So yeah, it might have been him too in there [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2025.66s)]
*  um [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2031.58s)]
*  So a bunch of people and now it it seems although it hasn't [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2032.7s)]
*  exactly [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2037.0s)]
*  Been made clear, but it seems like there was um [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2038.54s)]
*  It was people basically, you know for you guys who don't know of course we did an episode on this before [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2044.3s)]
*  But there was a huge dust up on twitter [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2049.18s)]
*  um over this h1b, uh, uh visa program [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2051.2599999999998s)]
*  and [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2055.74s)]
*  The you know the vague rama swami tweet and a couple things that elon musk said [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2057.34s)]
*  really drew I mean a tremendous amount of uh [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2062.62s)]
*  Higher a lot of people were very upset about their position on on this stuff and [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2066.52s)]
*  You know there there was [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2074.8599999999997s)]
*  A lot of people were being let's just say very critical of them now all of these people [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2077.1s)]
*  I believe who have lost have been demonetized and lost their blue check and all of this were all people who were very [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2081.02s)]
*  adamantly against um [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2088.04s)]
*  Against [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2091.08s)]
*  on the other side of the hb1 visa, uh [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2092.2999999999997s)]
*  you know [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2096.06s)]
*  Policy these were people who are very critical of the program that elon musk and and the vague rama swami [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2097.74s)]
*  Well, I you know [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2103.42s)]
*  I shouldn't even say they were defending it because that's not exactly right as I said on the episode both of them kind of [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2104.14s)]
*  Said the things should be gutted and overhauled. But anyway, this was what the the big twitter storm was about [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2108.8599999999997s)]
*  however, all of the people who um [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2114.7799999999997s)]
*  who ended up being demonetized [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2118.7s)]
*  or [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2121.02s)]
*  Losing their blue check marks were not only people who were critical of the visa program [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2121.98s)]
*  Because there's many people who are critical of that who did not get demonetized or lose their blue check mark [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2127.3399999999997s)]
*  But they would they're also all let's say [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2132.46s)]
*  I want to put this in a way. That's the most um [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2135.8999999999996s)]
*  Charitable, let's say they're all pretty critical of not only israel but also of jews [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2139.48s)]
*  Um, because I also don't think I saw some of them saying that it's like oh, it's not really about that [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2146.22s)]
*  It's because we're critical of israel. But if i'm being honest, there's also a lot of people who are critical of israel [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2151.1s)]
*  You know like i'm critical of the visa program and of israel. I have not lost [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2156.06s)]
*  My my check mark or i'm not actually monetized on twitter [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2161.42s)]
*  But so I guess I guess they can't take that away from me because i've never actually monetized the damn thing [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2165.5s)]
*  I think i'm probably leaving money on the table for not doing that. Maybe I should [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2169.5s)]
*  but [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2174.06s)]
*  I'm not [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2175.18s)]
*  But no, it's it's people who are also critical of jews [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2176.38s)]
*  in general and [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2180.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, I don't know [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2182.54s)]
*  I just I wanted to give a few thoughts on this because I do think this is a bad path to go down [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2183.1800000000003s)]
*  I think this is not a wise decision by elon musk and I think if he is making this decision [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2188.86s)]
*  He should be transparent and clear about it [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2193.82s)]
*  to be 100 clear just [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2197.5s)]
*  disclosing my own bias or whatever I [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2201.16s)]
*  The people who have been [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2205.58s)]
*  Have been deplatformed to demonetize not deplatformed i'm sorry, but demonetized and lost their blue check mark and all of this [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2208.38s)]
*  They range I know some of them and i've done some of their shows [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2214.2999999999997s)]
*  And then some of them i've also had some fairly unpleasant interactions with so like a few of them have been particularly shitty to me [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2218.38s)]
*  um, and a few of them have been very nothing but kind and and respectful to me [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2225.74s)]
*  I also, you know full bias like i'm jewish and I don't like the anti-jewish stuff [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2231.18s)]
*  So that's my bias but in some ways [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2236.7s)]
*  That almost makes it a more interesting situation because if you really do, you know [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2239.5s)]
*  When you get into conversations about free speech and free speech platforms [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2243.66s)]
*  the stuff that you don't like is actually a better test of your [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2247.42s)]
*  Commitment to that value than the stuff you do like because of course we all want the stuff that we do like and do agree [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2250.62s)]
*  With to be you know, we don't want any of them to be silenced or demonetized. There's a great old, uh, gnome chomsky line [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2255.82s)]
*  Where he was said something like you don't believe in free speech unless you believe in free speech that you hate [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2263.18s)]
*  Because everybody believes in free speech that they love [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2269.1s)]
*  He said, uh, he said hitler and stalin were both believed in free speech that they agreed with like [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2271.98s)]
*  They weren't trying to shut you down [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2277.74s)]
*  If you said what they wanted you to say the whole point of freedom of speech is that you're allowed to say the things that [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2279.1s)]
*  Other people really don't want you to say that's the real test of it now [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2284.3799999999997s)]
*  Just a couple thoughts that I I have on this [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2289.18s)]
*  number one [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2292.06s)]
*  I am somebody who very much believes in in free in free speech [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2294.14s)]
*  When we talk about free speech though, I think a lot of times it's [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2299.98s)]
*  free speech freedom of speech is kind of like freedom of movement or the uh, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2304.86s)]
*  Freedom of religion or whatever. They're they're kind of abstractions. They're not exactly tangible. So like i'm not true [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2310.54s)]
*  Like people claim there are free speech absolutists [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2320.06s)]
*  I don't know if that's actually the technically correct term [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2323.98s)]
*  I'm much more of a property rights absolutist than I am a free speech absolutist [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2326.94s)]
*  And this is something that most of us are without ever really thinking about it. It's just it's kind of [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2332.06s)]
*  It's the de facto state of belief in a western civilized [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2338.7799999999997s)]
*  Society, so when I say property rights and not just speech rights [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2344.6s)]
*  I mean that you know [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2347.98s)]
*  You don't actually have the right to say whatever you want to say [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2350.06s)]
*  in somebody else's home [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2354.46s)]
*  right like [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2356.38s)]
*  so, uh, uh natalie who's our uh, uh producer who's here running the show right now we do I mean we're remote today but natalie [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2357.6600000000003s)]
*  And rob come to my house to record the show, uh, regularly now [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2364.78s)]
*  technically speaking [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2369.2400000000002s)]
*  I could kind of dictate what you're allowed to say or not say in my house [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2372.06s)]
*  Now I could be really arbitrary and tyrannical if you want to call it that with it I could say [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2375.98s)]
*  You're not allowed to use any words that will end in the letter a and if you do you have to get out of my house [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2382.62s)]
*  Technically, I have the right to do that. It would be pretty stupid [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2389.74s)]
*  But like I have the right to do that because it's my house so I can decide now [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2393.02s)]
*  Okay, if you're gonna proceed in your life that way good luck getting along with other people and maintaining relationships and things like that [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2398.54s)]
*  But technically we would all kind of agree that like you do have a right to tell someone to leave your house [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2404.3799999999997s)]
*  It's your house [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2408.9399999999996s)]
*  No, they still have their freedom of speech, but they're gonna have to take that speech somewhere else [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2410.06s)]
*  So that that's kind of like the base of how now there also are lots of rules [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2413.66s)]
*  None of them have ever been spoken out loud [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2420.06s)]
*  But they're always implied because everyone just knows it but like there are things you're not allowed to say in my house [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2422.2999999999997s)]
*  Like you you can't curse out my wife while you're here or you know [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2427.58s)]
*  Like now if next time you come over you curse out my wife [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2430.7799999999997s)]
*  I'd be like, I don't know if this is gonna work out with us, you know, because that's kind of a [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2433.2599999999998s)]
*  deal breaker for me, but so there is I just think it's important just to make this point to understand that it's like [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2437.5s)]
*  Whenever we talk about these things, it's always really about property rights now [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2443.18s)]
*  Technically, I'll say this [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2449.02s)]
*  What happened with twitter [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2452.46s)]
*  In the old twitter was not simply that the people who owned twitter decided what you were and weren't allowed to say [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2454.78s)]
*  On twitter what happened was the government got involved and heavily pressured and really kind of threatened [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2462.54s)]
*  These tech companies to crack down on speech [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2469.1s)]
*  So that to me is like a blatant first amendment violation and anti-free speech because it's not [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2471.82s)]
*  That's a very it's a very different thing if like [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2477.9s)]
*  I were to say [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2481.1s)]
*  Hey, you can't curse out my wife in my house or you got to get out of my house [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2482.46s)]
*  Then if the government were to come in and say you can't criticize the government in your house, right? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2486.06s)]
*  that those are just different in kind and [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2491.1s)]
*  So anyway, I what elon musk came in and he said he was going to make twitter a free speech platform [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2494.86s)]
*  And I also I want to give him a lot of credit here. Um, you know, I may [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2500.86s)]
*  I may have some disagreements with elon musk and and even with the vague ramaswami about some of the things they were saying about [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2506.06s)]
*  American culture what ramaswami was saying about american culture some and i'm [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2511.98s)]
*  A critic of the hb1 visa program [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2516.94s)]
*  I do also want to say I don't think either I think both of them have been like [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2521.8199999999997s)]
*  tremendously [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2525.88s)]
*  Forces for good in america over the last year two years particularly [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2527.18s)]
*  Um, and I think elon musk [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2532.8599999999997s)]
*  He he bought twitter and said he was going to make it a free speech platform [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2535.5s)]
*  And I think he certainly has made it much more of one than it used to be [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2540.22s)]
*  And so I think he's overall done a pretty good job now. He has fallen a little bit short of the goal [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2545.02s)]
*  That or of the um the promise I guess you could say that he made [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2551.98s)]
*  There was a a good example of this was uh when khanye west got kicked off of uh twitter [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2556.14s)]
*  I think he he posted a swastika or something like that [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2561.02s)]
*  There was like kind of it wasn't just a regular swastika was like some version of a swastika or whatever [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2564.38s)]
*  but he got kicked off twitter for this and [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2568.94s)]
*  This creates a problem because [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2572.14s)]
*  Elon musk came in and what he said and he was very clear about this [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2574.86s)]
*  He explicitly stated this on many different occasions [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2578.3s)]
*  He said this is a free speech platform and as long as you're not breaking the law [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2581.02s)]
*  You're not going to get kicked off [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2586.14s)]
*  Now it is not against the law for khanye to tweet a swastika, okay [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2588.8599999999997s)]
*  Uh, that's it's just not and so you could understand we're like, okay. Yeah like threatening somebody or something like that [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2593.58s)]
*  Okay, if that's illegal then you can't do that on twitter. So that would be like what elon stated limit was [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2600.2999999999997s)]
*  but [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2606.62s)]
*  Once you're kicking people off for hate speech [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2607.58s)]
*  You're no longer doing what you said you were going to do [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2611.18s)]
*  and [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2613.98s)]
*  Listen, this happens a lot in life people say they're going to do something [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2615.34s)]
*  They fall a little bit short of that [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2619.7400000000002s)]
*  But maybe it's still better that they said they were going to do that and they fall a little bit short rather than falling [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2621.26s)]
*  A lot of it short. Okay, but here's here's how I actually feel about this [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2625.7400000000002s)]
*  I [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2631.58s)]
*  My major beef with the old censorship regime [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2632.94s)]
*  Was that it was actually done by the government? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2638.1400000000003s)]
*  Which is like an institution of force and that it wasn't like [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2641.6600000000003s)]
*  Just somebody deciding what they wanted to do with their platform [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2646.86s)]
*  So that was my major issue with it and we've i've talked about this at length many times [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2650.54s)]
*  There's it's not just arbitrarily because I don't like the government but it's okay if a private company does it [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2654.46s)]
*  It's there's many reasons to want to draw a line there and say that no the government can't come in and start regulating speech [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2659.42s)]
*  But on top of that [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2668.6200000000003s)]
*  the major issue for me [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2670.86s)]
*  was always that [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2673.26s)]
*  People were getting kicked off of twitter for [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2675.42s)]
*  telling the truth [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2678.86s)]
*  I mean this was like a and and telling the truth that opposed the tyrannical regimes policies [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2680.86s)]
*  There are people like alex baronson were getting kicked off twitter for just telling the truth about covet and this happened to lots of people [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2687.1s)]
*  I mean and I've [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2694.54s)]
*  Witnessed a lot of it during the the covet years and of course not just on on twitter on facebook and instagram and all of these places [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2695.9s)]
*  youtube or all of them and [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2703.02s)]
*  So this was a major problem now. I I will say that I don't [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2705.9s)]
*  Like when it comes to these platforms, I don't necessarily think that there have to be no rules [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2711.7400000000002s)]
*  Or there have to be no, uh things that you're not allowed to say on the platform [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2718.14s)]
*  In other words what i'm saying is like my concern is that people are allowed to tell the truth [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2722.62s)]
*  If you were going to say the rules of twitter are like you're not allowed there's words [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2726.78s)]
*  You're not allowed to say like you can't say [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2731.5s)]
*  um, you know, whatever we have to bleep all the words out on youtube anyway, so just think of all the [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2734.46s)]
*  Fucked up words, you know, you're not supposed to say. Okay, if the rule was like you can't say that I don't really like [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2739.7400000000002s)]
*  My my thing isn't like no you have to be allowed to go call people [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2746.14s)]
*  On twitter or something like that if it was just like hey, you can't say that word here [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2750.2999999999997s)]
*  That wouldn't be the biggest deal to me [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2754.7s)]
*  The issue comes when it's like number one [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2757.2599999999998s)]
*  You're saying you're going to be a free speech platform [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2760.3799999999997s)]
*  You are saying that anything that doesn't violate the law you are allowed to say here, but then that's not true [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2763.2599999999998s)]
*  Now you got an issue because you're selling a product as something and it's not that and if if [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2769.8999999999996s)]
*  Elon musk's goal which he's said many times his goal is to make x the everything app [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2775.82s)]
*  The app where you can do your banking and pay your bills and communicate and research and fact check and and everything [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2781.34s)]
*  Particularly the banking aspect of it [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2789.1600000000003s)]
*  if you want that then you really you have to build up a level of trust where like [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2792.46s)]
*  Look, it doesn't mean there have to be no rules. I'll say this very clearly [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2798.2200000000003s)]
*  If I owned a giant tech platform [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2802.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm, not sure there wouldn't be any rules about what you're allowed and not allowed to say [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2805.02s)]
*  I mean there are certain things to me that I just find a porrent. I there you know, there's a whole like [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2809.1s)]
*  really weird strain of uh, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2814.52s)]
*  like leftist intersectional critical theory type people who uh, who actually coined the term [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2818.14s)]
*  minor attracted person [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2825.98s)]
*  Because they didn't feel that like that they felt like pedophile had like a negative condotation to it as it kind of does [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2828.38s)]
*  Right, you know, it's like that's kind of turned into a pejorative and they were like, hey [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2835.7400000000002s)]
*  It's just a sexual preference at the end of the day [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2839.9s)]
*  So we should call you minor attracted person not pedophile if I owned a big tech big tech platform [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2842.46s)]
*  I could very likely see myself saying nope [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2850.06s)]
*  You're not allowed to do that you get kicked off if you were trying to rehabilitate the image of pedophilia [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2853.2599999999998s)]
*  You get kicked off of my platform [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2858.9399999999996s)]
*  I i'm not against there being rules. Maybe there should even if you want to say again, I [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2861.8999999999996s)]
*  Know to be clear here. I wouldn't kick people off for um, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2868.06s)]
*  For for hating jews or something like that, but I could i'll i'll get into that in a second [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2871.8999999999996s)]
*  But the real issue is not that there can't be any rules [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2877.1s)]
*  The real issue is not that the rule has to be you're allowed to say anything as long as it doesn't break the law [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2880.2200000000003s)]
*  The issue is that that's what elon musk said [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2886.38s)]
*  multiple times explicitly [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2889.1600000000003s)]
*  I think that's the issue here [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2891.34s)]
*  Like if you want to my own and I think this is reasonable. Okay, my only real [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2893.34s)]
*  Demand not that i'm in a position to make demands of elon musk guys got a few bucks and a bit of influence [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2899.98s)]
*  but [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2906.46s)]
*  I would just say I think this is a reasonable request [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2907.5800000000004s)]
*  is that [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2910.78s)]
*  Be transparent about what the rules are [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2911.98s)]
*  Explain what the rules are and then apply them equally across the board [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2915.32s)]
*  I think if you do that you're going to clean up a lot of these problems [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2918.7000000000003s)]
*  Like if you want to say you're not allowed to post swastikas then fine [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2921.82s)]
*  But say that and make it very clear if you want to say you're not allowed to use this word or that word or say [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2926.06s)]
*  Okay now again i'm not saying I support that i'm saying it is your right to do that with your property which is this platform [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2932.06s)]
*  now [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2939.02s)]
*  If you I think if you did that you'd avoid a lot of the the issues a lot of the issues now also [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2940.54s)]
*  I want to be somewhat charitable here to elon musk and and just say that I think he has done a lot of good [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2947.74s)]
*  over the last few years and [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2953.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm sure there are struggles that come with running such a gigantic thing that I just can't imagine [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2956.06s)]
*  you know, I have I have [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2961.74s)]
*  Struggles just running the the couple podcasts that I do and you know [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2963.8199999999997s)]
*  Taking care of my kids and the managing my schedule and that that feels like a lot to me [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2969.02s)]
*  So i'm sure there are a lot of challenges with like running [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2974.06s)]
*  How many companies does elon musk have at this point that are all multi-billion dollar companies, you know [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2977.8999999999996s)]
*  I think there I I get that i'm sure there's a lot of challenges to that and I don't think he should be written off [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2982.62s)]
*  I don't think you know [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2987.58s)]
*  Vivek should be written off or anything like that. I think they're really important brilliant voices right now [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2988.86s)]
*  But I do think there's something here that you kind of got to deal with [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2995.02s)]
*  It's like what are the rules man? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=2998.46s)]
*  Because the rules clearly aren't what you just said now [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3000.6200000000003s)]
*  It is also true that he didn't kick people off at least again, by the way, correct me if i'm wrong [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3004.1400000000003s)]
*  Uh fans if somebody uh did get kicked off [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3009.82s)]
*  Of there, but I don't from what i've seen. I haven't seen that anybody actually. Um [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3013.02s)]
*  Any actually anyone actually got uh [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3016.54s)]
*  Got booted off of there. And so, okay. Listen, i'm trying to be reasonable and charitable here. That's an improvement [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3020.06s)]
*  That's an improvement from just booting people off certainly an improvement from like kicking people off for simply saying that like lockdowns are ineffective [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3025.98s)]
*  Or the vaccine doesn't work the way that these guys are telling you it does work. Um [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3033.42s)]
*  But I do think you gotta you gotta like be transparent about what the rules are [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3038.06s)]
*  Are and then apply them equally because the the problem is [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3043.98s)]
*  When you start to when you don't do that you can [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3049.74s)]
*  Find yourself in a situation like this where it sure does have the appearance that you're [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3054.54s)]
*  Like lowering the signal or depriving people's ability to make money on your platform [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3060.06s)]
*  Uh, because they were on a different side of an issue than you or they made you look bad [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3066.7s)]
*  You know and you don't want to have that that is a really good way to lose your credibility and lose [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3071.58s)]
*  Uh the credibility of x becoming what you want it to become the everything app [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3077.1s)]
*  Um, okay. So that's that's one thing and then I would just say on top of that [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3082.46s)]
*  And I say this again just to be clear with my bias here I don't like the anti-jewish stuff [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3088.1400000000003s)]
*  I am jewish. I don't [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3094.46s)]
*  Particularly like seeing that and I think it's um, I think it's not good [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3096.86s)]
*  I don't think it's right [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3101.66s)]
*  And you know as I've that we did a whole episode on this just recently. I also think it hurts [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3103.26s)]
*  I think it is very damaging [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3108.46s)]
*  to [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3110.7s)]
*  the cause that I [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3111.9s)]
*  believe in and I don't think it's like um, you know if if the argument is like [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3113.9s)]
*  That I only go to the surface level when i'm criticizing israel and the neocons [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3118.7s)]
*  But these guys get right to the heart of it, which is jews [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3122.86s)]
*  I think that's wrong. And I also think that many americans [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3126.3s)]
*  many people can be persuaded to believe that um, what israel's doing is really fucked up and that our country shouldn't be [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3131.5800000000004s)]
*  Funding and arming what they're doing [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3140.1400000000003s)]
*  That they shouldn't get an unconditional blank check from the united states of america [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3142.7000000000003s)]
*  I think people can also be persuaded to believe that like the neocons and the corporate media and the banking industry are all [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3146.46s)]
*  Incredibly corrupt and damaging to the country [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3154.92s)]
*  But if you're just trying to attach it to like hating jews [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3157.82s)]
*  I do think that you're gonna lose a lot of people because a lot of people correctly recognize that as being [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3160.3s)]
*  ugly and kind of stupid and not [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3165.9s)]

*  I would not if I had control of twitter ban any of those people or demonetize any of those people because it's just a [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3252.94s)]
*  Bad path to go down and it does not solve the problem [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3260.7s)]
*  It does not solve the problem at all [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3264.62s)]
*  Then when I say solve the problem from my perspective for someone who doesn't believe that hating jews is the correct answer [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3266.3s)]
*  um [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3273.1s)]
*  It only listen man, you know, I know it's that kind of old like [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3274.62s)]
*  classical liberals [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3278.92s)]
*  You know slogan or whatever sunlight is the best disinfectant or you fight bad ideas with good ideas [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3281.1s)]
*  The answer to hate speech is more speech, but I do think that's all true [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3287.42s)]
*  I really do. I don't think driving [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3291.9s)]
*  Attempting to drive things into a dark corner does not make them better and [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3294.92s)]
*  Shouldn't we all know this at this point? I mean look even if you are because you know, I do see I see a lot of people [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3301.42s)]
*  um some other people who [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3308.0600000000004s)]
*  Not been very friendly to me [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3311.0200000000004s)]
*  But who are like celebrating [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3313.66s)]

*  um, I think that's very short-sighted [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3320.86s)]
*  I mean look think back if you are one of the people who really goes like [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3323.5s)]
*  Anti-semitism is out of control and there's all of this vile jew hatred on twitter or something like that. Well, I mean think about the censorship regime [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3328.36s)]
*  That really started in 2016 [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3338.14s)]
*  There were some people who were censored before that but it really started in mass in 2016 [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3340.22s)]
*  And went all the way up until elon musk bought twitter [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3344.46s)]
*  So it was at least what I think he bought it in 22 [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3348.8599999999997s)]
*  So, you know it was from [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3352.54s)]
*  2016 to 2022 [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3355.48s)]
*  Every one of them was kicked off. All of them were booted from all platforms, you know [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3358.22s)]
*  um and [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3363.42s)]
*  If you're saying anti-semitism is worse than ever well, then I mean clearly we could deduce that that didn't work [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3365.18s)]
*  So it's not even effective for your cause. I I think I would argue it's kind of in a [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3371.1s)]
*  Maybe there's a I didn't plan on making a connection between these two, but maybe there's even a similarity to um the blowback [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3375.74s)]
*  uh stuff that like, you know, it actually ends up having this reverse unintended consequence of a lot of people [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3382.86s)]
*  End up going like oh well, how come you have to silence this guy? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3390.38s)]
*  Well, maybe he's really telling the secret truth and it draws more people in there. And I also think that it just um [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3394.94s)]
*  If your goal was to pull anyone out of that way of thinking I just think this is the worst way to do it [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3401.9s)]
*  So what I you know, I I don't support any of these guys getting uh demonetized or getting their blue checks taken away [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3407.34s)]
*  um, obviously like like I said before there's a [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3414.6200000000003s)]
*  There's a range in that group of people who have been nothing but cool to me and some people who have been pretty shitty to me [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3417.3399999999997s)]
*  But it doesn't matter, you know [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3422.62s)]
*  Like it shouldn't matter whether you were shitty to me or you were cool to me or whether I agree with your view or whether I [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3424.14s)]
*  vehemently disagree with your view [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3430.7799999999997s)]
*  What are we doing here with x? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3432.86s)]
*  Are we saying we you know for years? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3435.02s)]
*  And I think this is something that for a radical libertarian like myself. There's always been this kind of question mark. It's like [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3438.06s)]
*  For for years that now since donald trump was president the first time really the talking point has become [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3444.7000000000003s)]
*  Well now free speech is a right wing value. And when did that happen? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3450.78s)]
*  Why does that that should be something we all agree on but you know [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3455.42s)]
*  There's this dynamic and i've talked about this many many times in the past, but when you're okay [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3459.9s)]
*  so if you're getting mugged at gunpoint [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3465.5s)]
*  And you you got a gun pointed at you you're unarmed the guy mugging you has a gun it's pointed at you and you go [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3468.3s)]
*  Hey, I don't believe in violence. I don't believe we should point guns at people and take their money now. That is the correct position [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3475.7400000000002s)]
*  But it's also a very easy position to have when someone else has the gun and they're pointing it at you when you have the gun [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3483.5800000000004s)]
*  Then that's the real test of whether you believe in violence or not, right? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3489.9s)]
*  then you it really means something and so [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3494.38s)]
*  I think there are there are some people who have been making the case [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3498.06s)]
*  Through the years where the woke progressives had dominant control over big tech and the corporate media and the political class [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3502.6200000000003s)]
*  And and hollywood and academia and all the rest when the woke progressives had control of all of that and they say hey [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3509.98s)]
*  We're for free speech [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3516.3s)]
*  This was said by a lot of people but like if you really are for free speech [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3518.54s)]
*  Then the test kind of comes when you actually have some control over that and when you have control and things you don't like [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3523.42s)]
*  Are being said then I do just think that um [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3530.2200000000003s)]
*  And I guess i've always believed this since the the ron paul days that [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3534.86s)]
*  we [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3540.3s)]
*  People if you believe you have the truth on your side and you're fighting for what's right [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3541.9s)]
*  Then you should be on the side of opposing [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3546.86s)]
*  Censorship particularly on the internet because it's our only shot [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3550.7999999999997s)]
*  to ever like get the truth out there and [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3556.0s)]
*  Again, again, this is all kind of like classical liberal, you know [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3559.44s)]
*  Wisdom [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3565.04s)]
*  but [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3566.3199999999997s)]
*  You know be be careful of a tool like this man [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3567.6s)]
*  I mean even if you think just for now it's like well, maybe you really don't like those people very much who are getting [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3570.3999999999996s)]
*  demonetized, okay [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3575.98s)]
*  But you once you accept that premise once you accept that precedent [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3577.68s)]
*  You may have an opinion that's really seen as pretty vile by some people at some point, too [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3584.0s)]
*  You may have an opinion that opposes the regime in some way and that [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3588.56s)]
*  Is when you're really not going to want censorship to be around think it's something to think about [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3593.68s)]
*  All right. Listen, I gotta wrap the show up there. I'm gonna go spend the rest of new year's day with the family [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3598.7999999999997s)]
*  Thank you guys so much for listening. Thank you everyone who's a subscriber at part of the problem.com for subscribing I uh, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhYklZSNb8&t=3603.44s)]
