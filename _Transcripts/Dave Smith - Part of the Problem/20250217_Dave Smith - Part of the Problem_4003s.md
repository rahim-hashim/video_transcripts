*  We've done Houston before and it's a great great comedy town [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  but anyway, then right after that we will be in Buffalo, New York of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=65.08s)]
*  Going forward maybe we're gonna try to book that one in the summer [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=72.6s)]
*  But we're going to Buffalo in the middle of winter to do helium comedy club, which I have heard [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  I love helium in in Philly, but I've never done the one in Buffalo before I've heard it's a great great club [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=80.08s)]
*  So very much looking to that so looking forward to that. So Houston and Buffalo are the next two coming up [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=85.84s)]
*  comicdavismith.com for those for those ticket links [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  All right. Well, let's uh, there's been a lot going on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=96.52s)]
*  in in the world and there's a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=101.8s)]
*  Particularly of the the very viral stories at the moment a lot of them seem to revolve around [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  the topic of free speech and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=112.52s)]
*  and Europe [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  In more broadly and you know Rob, I've been I've been on the record for many years now [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=118.36s)]
*  Unapologetically that I I do not care about Europe. I [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=125.72s)]
*  I [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=130.36s)]
*  Just don't really care that much. I I mean look I I care once it starts effect in America [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=131.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, I certainly care a lot about the the war there in Eastern Europe [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=137.4s)]
*  That's been going on for the last few years [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=141.32s)]
*  But in general like I'm not and this is kind of how I feel a bit like I think it almost is the correct default [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=143.44s)]
*  Position like I don't I I care obviously if there's like horrific things going on if there's horrible human rights [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=152.16s)]
*  Human rights abuses. We'd all rather that not happen [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=159.52s)]
*  I hope everybody is free and prosperous and I root for everyone, you know [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I hope I hope the North Koreans are free their prospects for that don't look so great at the moment [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=166.56s)]
*  But like I hope they're free. I [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=172.44s)]
*  Root for prosperity and freedom across the board [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=174.84s)]
*  But I really care much more when it actually affects America or when America is involved or as is the case [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Far too often America is doing the killing or backing the killers or whatever [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=184.72s)]
*  but it it is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  Perhaps the case that it you know one ought to care a little bit [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not a good state of affairs if Europe is falling but between [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=197.16s)]
*  the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  There's first I guess we could start with JD Vance's speech [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=204.52s)]
*  That he gave in Germany and then there was the 60 minutes piece that's been going super viral [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=208.44s)]
*  We're gonna play a clip from that in a second [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=213.36s)]
*  And then there's also kind of the the negotiations that seem to be starting to potentially bring an end to the war in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=215.52s)]
*  Ukraine and all of them are kind of there's some overlap between all of them, but let's just start [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  with JD Vance's speech [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  Because I did find it to be a truly remarkable [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  Political speech that seemed almost it seemed more like the type of thing you might hear on like a podcast [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  That we do Rob or somewhere in our world and it seemed [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=243.68s)]
*  The thing to me that was really striking was that the guy who's a heartbeat away from the presidency and probably right now [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=247.6s)]
*  The favorite to be the Republican nominee in in 28. I mean, I'd assume it would have to be JD Vance [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=253.92s)]
*  I'm not sure I'm sure there are betting markets on that type of stuff, but I'd imagine he's the overwhelming favorite right now [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=260.28s)]
*  It was just kind of interesting to hear him say [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=266.0s)]
*  Some of the things he said so did you did you watch the speech Rob this I saw that it made the headlines [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=269.20000000000005s)]
*  And I did not watch this speech [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=274.56s)]
*  well, one of the things to me that I thought was very interesting is that he [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=277.0s)]
*  He's giving this speech. He gave it in kind of a friendly it like he presented it as [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=282.12s)]
*  Like he said us us a lot when he was talking about Europe like he presented as like look this is like [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=289.32000000000005s)]
*  friendly advice [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=295.56s)]
*  But one of the major points I think in fact the major theme of the speech was [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=297.32s)]
*  Well, I think it was essentially that Europe has lost its way and that we we here at these like elite gatherings [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  We hear so much about [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  National defense and national security risks and meanwhile the greatest risk to Europe is really coming from inside the house [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  And it is that that Europe has [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=321.44s)]
*  Rejected so many of the principles that made Western civilization great and again [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=324.32s)]
*  This is just like something to me. It's like that, you know, it's like when I was getting in an argument with that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=330.6s)]
*  that Kara Swisher lady on on [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=336.8s)]
*  On Pierce Morgan the other day and she was talking about how like the government needs to regulate social media because [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=341.24s)]
*  Iran and China want to spread misinformation [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=349.0s)]
*  And then you know, I was making kind of fairly obvious counterpoint to that which is that like yeah [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=352.52s)]
*  But look our own government has spread so much misinformation [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=358.08s)]
*  So like and much more devastating misinformation like you can't you can't give me examples of Iranian disinformation or Chinese [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=362.2s)]
*  disinformation that has had the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=370.32s)]
*  horrific catastrophic results that that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=372.52s)]
*  Disinformation from our own government has had so why would we put them in charge of it? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=375.76s)]
*  And then she basically just called me naive and said you have no idea what Iran and China want to do to us [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=379.08s)]
*  That's like anyway, I just [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=384.88s)]
*  One of the things it's such an interesting like obvious point is that look [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=388.12s)]
*  It's true in the United States of America and obviously it's true in Europe as well [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=394.64s)]
*  That with the exception of like maybe I'd say with the exception of say like some Eastern European states who might be concerned about [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=398.76000000000005s)]
*  Russia. Okay, like there's a legit concern of the outsider there, but in general [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=405.88s)]
*  it's like [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  anything aside from [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  Non NATO Eastern European countries for the rest of them. It's like well Vladimir Putin couldn't even take Kiev [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=417.92s)]
*  So what threat is he to take any of the rest of Europe and if that's the case, you know [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=425.76s)]
*  Look like as the example in the United States of America [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=431.84s)]
*  We've had lots of enemies some pretty serious enemies and if you want to go back before our lifetime [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=434.48s)]
*  You know, but from the very beginning of America who are the great enemies of America? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=440.5s)]
*  The well there was the British Empire [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=445.24s)]
*  there I guess I [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=449.4s)]
*  Mean even art to any of the monarchs in Europe in the First World War even really count as great enemy [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=452.4s)]
*  Like to the Barbary pirates count as great enemies. Yeah, it's kind of like you had the British Empire [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  You have the Nazis the Imperial Japanese [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=464.88s)]
*  Americans [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=468.76s)]
*  They didn't put up too much of a fight I guess they put up a little bit of a fight fine [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=472.88s)]
*  But even the Native Americans if you want to count them [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=476.35999999999996s)]
*  the Soviet Union [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=479.28s)]
*  Al-Qaeda Isis, right? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=481.56s)]
*  Like there's all there's been some serious enemies and some of them are pretty goddamn evil [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=483.56s)]
*  and some more powerful than others, but [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  Were any of them a threat to destroy the United States of America? I really don't think so. None of them even came close [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  However, is the 36 trillion dollars of debt? Is that a threat to destroy America? Yeah, it is [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=499.0s)]
*  Is the permanent warfare state a threat to destroy America? Yeah, it sure is [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  So I think it's just kind of almost obvious when you look at it on its face that like look I mean [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=509.44s)]
*  I'm sure that if Osama bin Laden or Adolf Hitler or or [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=515.52s)]
*  Stalin [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=520.08s)]
*  Could have they would have shut down the US economy [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=521.2s)]
*  I'm sure they would have if they could have but none of them could but you know who could shut down the US economy [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=524.14s)]
*  Our own politicians, you know, and so now anyway [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  JD Vance was talking about Europe not America, but I think a lot of the stuff still applies [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=533.44s)]
*  But anyway, it was just very interesting to to hear him talk about this stuff and then one of the the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=537.72s)]
*  things that seemed to get [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=544.76s)]
*  like the people that got like such a hysterical reaction was [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=546.96s)]
*  him talking about how many European states have kind of abandoned the concept of free speech and that people ought to be [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  allowed to say what they want to say and this [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=558.28s)]
*  Response has been really something to behold. I don't know any thoughts on any of this rub [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=561.88s)]
*  Well, I saw some of the freak out in the response and that I was certainly entertained by it really it's it's also just so [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=568.16s)]
*  One of the things that's been so bizarre over the last decade and of course, obviously there's things have changed quite a bit [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=577.52s)]
*  There's been like a major pendulum swing or something since you know the this last year [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=584.52s)]
*  And of course Trump winning the presidency again, but it is just so bizarre [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=590.96s)]
*  I know this is kind of like a basic thing to say not like this isn't my unique hot take or anything, but the idea of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=596.6s)]
*  being [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=604.6s)]
*  for free speech as [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=605.84s)]
*  as even the idea that that's even something that isn't just like a [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=608.92s)]
*  starting place for all of us [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean, it's like it's like so strange wall the kind of progressive [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=617.72s)]
*  Establishment has been hysterical about the threats to democracy [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=622.48s)]
*  Whatever exactly that means that they've also decided that free speech is a right-wing value [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  It's just all so utterly bizarre. I think their jobs rely on censorship [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=634.24s)]
*  So they're gonna they're gonna preach the dangers of free speech because it's their competition is people giving you the truth [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, this one clip has been going super viral [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=646.78s)]
*  I actually I will say that there aren't you know, I [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=650.82s)]
*  For a living, you know, like we tear apart the corporate media constantly and I'm you know, I've I've [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=658.78s)]
*  to be known and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=666.58s)]
*  At least probably one of if not the most like signature things in my career is the debate with Chris Cuomo [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=668.82s)]
*  I've gone viral [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=675.58s)]
*  More times than I could count that me and you have just torn apart some piece by the corporate media and in general [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=678.1800000000001s)]
*  I kind of know their game and nothing they say really shocks me anymore [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=684.86s)]
*  This one actually got me I mean like this would I don't even want to like poison the well here [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=689.82s)]
*  Let's play the clip and then we can respond to it. This was on face the nation [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=695.94s)]
*  This past Sunday, I should say yesterday [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=699.94s)]
*  With Marco Rubio the current secretary [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=703.26s)]
*  Yeah, we're not the biggest Rubio fans here, but he's you know, but there is something I love Lucy really did warm you up [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=707.4200000000001s)]
*  Do a nice-looking Cuban [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=713.46s)]
*  But this was I mean to the point that I was like trying to figure out what the hell she really meant [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=715.5400000000001s)]
*  Like I couldn't even believe these words came out of her mouth. But again, this is the woman [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=721.7800000000001s)]
*  I'm blaming on her name right now, but this is a woman who moderated that I believe the vice presidential debates [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=725.3000000000001s)]
*  There's also just something so bad shit crazy that you're supposed to be neutral or pretending to be neutral if you're on these news networks [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=730.06s)]
*  Yes, and forget asking [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=737.52s)]
*  non-neutral questions, but dramatically crying as if [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=740.54s)]
*  Some new I don't know regime is taking over [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=745.4599999999999s)]
*  Like it's it's the next level of trying to sell bullshit is also dramatically [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=748.9399999999999s)]
*  pretending like all of our lives are gonna be ruined because of the other person on the screen and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=754.14s)]
*  You know what I mean, it's like that's a different level of spin. They're going more crazy girlfriend on us there [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=760.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good way to put it. All right, let's let's play this clip and then we will discuss the historical accuracy of the claim being made [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=766.38s)]
*  well [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=774.02s)]
*  he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide and [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=774.54s)]
*  he met with the head of a political party that has [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=780.98s)]
*  Far right views and some historic ties to extreme groups [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=784.86s)]
*  the context of that was [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=791.4200000000001s)]
*  Changing the tone of it and you know that that the censorship disagree with you [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=795.38s)]
*  I have to disagree with you. Can you pause? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=801.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if we can pull up the transcript of that [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=803.74s)]
*  But that's like seven degrees of bacon to not even being able to make a point at the end of that and you know that [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=806.7800000000001s)]
*  When you've layers of random things you try to bring together to claim that there was a dog whistle here [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=814.22s)]
*  Well, but but her claim that I mean this is truly like I when I first heard this [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=820.6s)]
*  I was almost like I [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=827.5400000000001s)]
*  Re-listened to it and I was like wait [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=828.86s)]
*  What was she trying to say there because like I don't want to jump on someone if they just like [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=830.14s)]
*  Misspoke or something like that happens to all of us. You know what? I mean, like you just oh, no [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=834.26s)]
*  Yeah, I said that but I didn't mean that I meant this but she goes [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=838.0s)]
*  But but as I listened to it the second time you go now there's really no mistaking it her complaint is that [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=840.92s)]
*  JD Vance went to Germany and talked about how Europe is [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=848.16s)]
*  Abandoning free speech and so it makes no sense that she'd be saying anything else [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=853.12s)]
*  She's saying it's offensive to go to Germany of all places and argue for free speech when free speech being [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=857.64s)]
*  weaponized is what led to the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=865.3199999999999s)]
*  Genocide of the Jews like who? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=868.8s)]
*  like the funny thing about this is that it's not even just like it who even learned it that way in in government school [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=872.6s)]
*  Like what what like I what historical revisionism school of thought is this that it was? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=880.52s)]
*  Excessive free speech in Nazi Germany is what that's what happened [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=888.02s)]
*  That's your understanding of the story is like Adolf Hitler got in there [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=892.88s)]
*  And then he just started letting everybody say what they wanted to say and [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=896.56s)]
*  Obviously yada yada yada [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=901.72s)]
*  six million dead Jews [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=904.56s)]
*  That's how it went down like what what are you talking about? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=907.16s)]
*  Like the Nazis pretty famously cracked down on speech [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  If you wanted to look throughout say the 20th century at a regime that cracked down on free speech the most [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=915.72s)]
*  They'd be up there in the running for it. I'm not saying they they lead the way there's definitely some competition [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=924.28s)]
*  But from what I remember they burn the books that more people couldn't read them be forced to speak [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=931.76s)]
*  And so it was actually an amplification of freedom of speech. Yeah, they motivated people to speak more [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=936.68s)]
*  Like what really is the claim here? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=943.8s)]
*  But this is so so what she's trying and they congregated them on trains so that they would be closer together and forced to have discussion [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=946.0799999999999s)]
*  once again [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=953.16s)]
*  Free stuff, but you're you're totally right [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=954.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's like she just she start she's starting backward from the like, how can I say this makes you a Nazi? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=956.36s)]
*  And then it's like, okay. Well, it was in Germany [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  It was in Germany and you're arguing for free speech and free speech is what led to the Nazis [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=964.92s)]
*  And then he met with a far right wing group like okay [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=970.8399999999999s)]
*  So this even this far right wing group, which again, I don't know enough about the internal politics of European nations [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=974.4s)]
*  But like I think we are past, you know, I was on um, I was on [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=979.98s)]
*  Pierce Morgan's show [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=987.74s)]
*  like maybe a month or so ago and I was on with Tim Poole and the topic of [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=989.9s)]
*  Tommy Robinson and the the Muslim like gang rape things in [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=997.14s)]
*  England came up and and it's one of those topics like I just don't know that much about it [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1004.02s)]
*  I've read a few articles about it [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1008.16s)]
*  But I don't like to like read three articles about something and then start speaking like I'm an authority on that topic [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1009.62s)]
*  But you know, you're actually pretty good about it believe me [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1017.8s)]
*  There's a lot of people who are quite comfortable doing that [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1020.24s)]
*  But I try to have you know, if I'm if I'm like really passionately talking about something [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1023.16s)]
*  It's it's something I've at least read a couple books about I've at least spent I've at least spent like a few dozen hours [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1028.84s)]
*  Thinking about this and and you know, you know, whatever I try to at least do that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1035.64s)]
*  But so I didn't really have to like, you know, I was talking about a couple of the other things [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1041.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't really have like a hot take on it. But I remember Tim Poole said at one point [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1045.1000000000001s)]
*  I really actually quite liked this is that um, so Pierce Morgan said something about you know, how Tommy Robinson isn't a good guy [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1048.88s)]
*  He's a bad guy. He's doing all these things and like all this stuff was reported in the British media and and Tim Poole just goes [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1056.3600000000001s)]
*  Look Pierce, he goes you got to understand my starting point here is that I don't believe any of you [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1063.28s)]
*  And I understand that that's not like the most educated [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1070.32s)]
*  Argument you could make but I kind of get what Tim was saying and I was like, yeah, that's actually nuts [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1074.36s)]
*  And he's like look man [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1079.6s)]
*  Your government was covering up pedophile rings and the one guy who was exposing it ends up being prosecuted on all these different charges [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1080.68s)]
*  I don't buy it. I [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1088.68s)]
*  Think you were just going at you know, it's like there is a certain point where [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1090.24s)]
*  It is reasonable to just be like you've lost all trust that you saying it means nothing to me [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1095.64s)]
*  It just it doesn't it's like, you know [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1101.72s)]
*  if you're like [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1104.64s)]
*  like in in if you were in a relationship and like your boyfriend [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1106.4s)]
*  Ceded on you like a hundred times and you caught him a hundred times and then you suspect him one more time and you're and he's [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1111.84s)]
*  Like no, I swear I'm not cheating you're like, yeah, but that doesn't mean anything anymore [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1118.0s)]
*  That doesn't and so I will say that when people like this lady say like oh, there's some far right-wing political group in Germany [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1121.44s)]
*  I just don't believe you like I don't know. Maybe they are maybe they are really far extreme far right-wing group [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1129.36s)]
*  but I don't believe you that they are because you would consider literally if if [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1135.74s)]
*  You could have been [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1142.04s)]
*  the most hardcore [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1143.8s)]
*  Lefty who just five years ago went like I don't really believe like little boys can become little girls and you would have called [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1146.24s)]
*  Them far right, you know what? I mean, like if you have one opinion that strays from the narrative you call them far, right? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1153.0s)]
*  So this means nothing and then my other thought is like Aisa when JD Vance met with those far right wingers [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1159.96s)]
*  Did they agree with his message about free speech? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1164.9199999999998s)]
*  Because if they did then okay great then he's actually arguing for liberal values [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1169.24s)]
*  I'm sorry [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1174.74s)]
*  There is no way to get away from the fact that free speech is a liberal value [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1175.42s)]
*  If it's not then these words mean nothing. So what you're saying is that this guy [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1179.84s)]
*  Who's the vice president of the United States of America? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1185.66s)]
*  Who is it? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1188.26s)]
*  You know Trump's number two somebody that say like your right wing parties might actually listen to is [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1189.38s)]
*  Going out there and arguing that they should embrace free speech [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1195.6200000000001s)]
*  How do you make that sound bad? I? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1198.98s)]
*  Guess the only way is to say that free speech is what led to the Holocaust [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1206.5s)]
*  Here, let's just play the end of this clip because it is actually Marco Rubio who I'd never like to agree with but it is [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1208.3400000000001s)]
*  Pretty funny what his response was [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1213.4s)]
*  That the censorship disagree with you [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1216.42s)]
*  About the right. I have to disagree with you [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1219.14s)]
*  Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide the genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1222.94s)]
*  Genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they had a list of people they hated [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1229.3000000000002s)]
*  But primarily the Jews there was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none. There was also no opposition in Nazi Germany [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1234.44s)]
*  They were a soul and only party that governed that country. So that's not an accurate reflection of history [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1240.7s)]
*  Well, he was okay. So I mean look [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1245.5400000000002s)]
*  Do you know you know how perfect you got to throw a lob in order to get Marco Rubio to dunk on you like that? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1249.22s)]
*  You know how fucking Gary Payton perfect the John Stockton just perfect lob [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1256.14s)]
*  You got to throw in order to set him up [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1261.46s)]
*  It was almost you could almost like see the little glimmer and Marco Rubio's eyes where it's like at the end of white men [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1263.62s)]
*  Can't jump where he's like, oh I could dunk that one. That's pretty easy [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1268.86s)]
*  I don't see how I could am I being baited into a trap here like it's like I'm gonna take issue with your [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1272.78s)]
*  claim that in excess of free speech is what led to the [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1279.26s)]
*  Genocide of the Jews of the Second World War. That is not that's not how I remember it [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1284.46s)]
*  That's not how I was taught, you know, it's just I don't know but uh [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1289.82s)]
*  Like there is look I mean like Rob you kind of gave away the answer at the beginning as I'm sure [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1294.22s)]
*  You know most people listening know but right there. It's just the game is that [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1300.3s)]
*  There the [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1306.9s)]
*  Establishments rule [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1310.7s)]
*  relies on censoring speech and [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1312.3s)]
*  That's really as simple as it is. And so they actually do it's it's you know, every accusation is a confession type thing [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1315.02s)]
*  They're confessing here that actually yeah [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1321.6599999999999s)]
*  They do see this as a threat to the world the the global world order [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1324.22s)]
*  That the vice president would be going over and advocating for free speech in Europe [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1329.8999999999999s)]
*  let that sink in for a little bit that they actually see that as like an [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1333.86s)]
*  Alarming controversial view [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1340.78s)]
*  you should go over and [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1344.3s)]
*  And argue in Europe that they ought to allow their citizens to dissent from the government [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1346.5s)]
*  Which is by the way all that free speech is all [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1354.26s)]
*  Is ever about really when you think about it, you know [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1359.5s)]
*  It's all just about like are you allowed to dissent from the people with the guns? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1363.22s)]
*  Like are you are you allowed? You know, there's this group of people that are at the center of [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1369.02s)]
*  society that call themselves the government and [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1375.14s)]
*  Essentially what a government is is a group of people who have a monopoly on the aggressive use of violence [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1378.0600000000002s)]
*  Right. This is like of all the different ways that people think of governments and if I were to go into say [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1385.94s)]
*  If I were to go into like a high school or a college class or something like that I were to ask [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1392.98s)]
*  Somebody for a definition of the government say what is the government, you know [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1399.42s)]
*  There'd be a lot of different answers that people would give me [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1405.58s)]
*  None of them would be an accurate description [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1408.58s)]
*  the only accurate description of a government is a group of people who maintain a monopoly on the [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1410.98s)]
*  Initiation of violence or threats thereof that really describes the government if you think about it [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1419.26s)]
*  Okay, because you could say like oh the government are the ones who write the laws or something like that [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1424.5s)]
*  But I could go I don't know I write the laws for my house [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1430.38s)]
*  Am I the government of my house and it's like no not really even though you can make the rules [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1433.88s)]
*  You can make the rules to you [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1439.42s)]
*  You could make the rules whatever you want to in your house if you own it [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1441.1s)]
*  I could make the rules that you have to wear green pants and hop on one leg when you come in my house [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1443.98s)]
*  But why am I not a government? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1448.98s)]
*  The reason is because all I can really do to enforce that is kick you out of my house [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1451.1s)]
*  All I can do is take a ledge [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1456.5s)]
*  I can't like a initiate violence against you [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1458.46s)]
*  Otherwise the government will come in and arrest me because I'm a criminal now. You're not allowed to do that [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1461.54s)]
*  There's only one group of people who are allowed to do that and that's the government they have the military [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1466.82s)]
*  They have the cops they have more guns than everybody else and so they decide what they're allowed to do and what you're allowed to [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1472.46s)]
*  Do now they can tax you and call it taxation if anybody else were to do that you'd be [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1478.94s)]
*  You'd be guilty of extortion or robbery or whatever. They can start a war. Nobody else can do that [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1485.58s)]
*  They can throw you in prison. Nobody else can do that. They are the what they have a monopoly in the truest sense of the term [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1491.32s)]
*  They are the only ones who are allowed to initiate violence without consequences [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1497.74s)]
*  At least in theoretically like you could get away with killing somebody but you're at least risking that you would go to jail for it [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1503.7s)]
*  Whereas the government isn't even risking that and so this whole free speech conversation [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1510.38s)]
*  Really what it's about is about whether you're free to dissent from the government or not [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1514.94s)]
*  Other than that like even even in the height of say like tech censorship, right? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1520.94s)]
*  Which what would you say 2020 was probably the worst year of tech censorship? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1526.22s)]
*  There were people arguing for like flat earthers and stuff on there [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1530.26s)]
*  There were people doing all that, you know what I'm saying? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1534.7800000000002s)]
*  Like you could you could have conspiracy theories you could be wrong about stuff [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1536.8200000000002s)]
*  You could always criticize people who it's popular to criticize [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1541.1000000000001s)]
*  But you couldn't really criticize the lockdowns or the kovat facts [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1545.26s)]
*  Like you can't you can't criticize them and so this is what it always comes down to [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1548.94s)]
*  It's the the question is [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1554.14s)]
*  Should Europeans be allowed to criticize their governments and JD Vance is taking the radical and dangerous position that they ought to be allowed to [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1557.14s)]
*  That's really what what it all comes down to [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1567.7s)]
*  it's really incredible what the media will try and sell you on and I'm [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1571.5800000000002s)]
*  Loving this storyline of them outraged over what's going on with Doge [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1576.66s)]
*  And them trying to say they're not actually finding fraud and abuse and [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1581.82s)]
*  it's such an odd approach from the media because we're spending too much money as a country and [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1586.82s)]
*  if there's actually [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1593.38s)]
*  Massive amounts of just fraudulent payments that Elon Musk is able to clean up and maybe get us out of this mess without having to [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1594.8600000000001s)]
*  Even cut back on too many entitlement programs [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1601.38s)]
*  That would be such a massive win if you could cut the budget deficit by 20% because it turns out [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1604.58s)]
*  It's just going to faulty Social Security numbers and just sporadic bank accounts abroad [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1610.26s)]
*  Wouldn't that be a great turnaround story that someone managed to clean that up? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1615.82s)]
*  And it's amazing how the entire media apparatus is screaming about how [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1619.98s)]
*  even though he's got the power of the president and the president won in part because he was gonna do this and [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1624.58s)]
*  It's no different than when governments create agencies and nothing's happening without the authority of the president [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1629.66s)]
*  They couldn't be more outraged over the fact that fraud and abuse is being discovered and they're trying to spin every story is no [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1635.18s)]
*  It's not actually being covered or it's minor or that's impossible [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1641.5400000000002s)]
*  The government has other other agencies that would spot this if it was there [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1644.98s)]
*  It's such an amazing thing that they want to sell you on no [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1648.8600000000001s)]
*  They can't possibly be covering on fraud and abuse fraud and abuse. Well, it's also like the the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1651.98s)]
*  You know like so many of the responses to the Doge stuff are that right? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1659.0600000000002s)]
*  One of them will be there's there's a couple that I've seen they're all just [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1663.38s)]
*  Cartoonishly stupid [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1668.9s)]
*  But one of them is that like no, no, no, this isn't the appropriate [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1670.5800000000002s)]
*  Way to do this and that we already have things in position for that. Yeah. Well, they're not working [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1675.8200000000002s)]
*  That's like the newest thing out of Europe is Europe needs to be at the table for the negotiations in order for us to have a [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1683.5400000000002s)]
*  Long lasting piece or a solidified piece or the way I forget the bullshit you were that they're using [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1689.9s)]
*  But they're admitting like oh, yeah, Donald Trump could probably get this done [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1695.46s)]
*  But their new bullshit the same is that Putin was gonna take over all of Europe is that it won't be a lasting piece [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1698.98s)]
*  Unless Europe's at the table and it's like what exactly is your brain to the table in this discussion? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1704.3s)]
*  That will make it a lasting piece [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1709.34s)]
*  Donald Trump. Yeah, of course. It's bullshit bullshit. It's also like look. I mean this is [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1712.18s)]
*  Look, this is kind of harsh to say [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1717.88s)]
*  and [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1720.8400000000001s)]
*  Just to be clear because I obviously I've talked about this for years and years now [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1722.3200000000002s)]
*  but Ukraine really is a victim in all of this and like that that's certainly it like [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1725.8600000000001s)]
*  That's something that should be appreciated like and and basically all the people in our camp who have been arguing against this war from the [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1733.48s)]
*  Very beginning of all been saying that the whole time [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1740.8000000000002s)]
*  It was John Mearsheimer's quote in I think he said it in either 2014 or 2015 [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1743.0s)]
*  But it was where he said the US is leading Ukraine down the primrose path [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1749.1200000000001s)]
*  Which evidently I did not know at the time when I heard it [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1755.04s)]
*  I remember hearing the speech and being like, oh, that's a that's a real beautiful way to say that and like I like it kind [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1758.1000000000001s)]
*  Of made sense even but anyway [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1763.3600000000001s)]
*  It comes from Shakespeare and the idea is like that you're leading someone down a beautiful path that ultimately leads to their demise [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1764.3600000000001s)]
*  So like we're saying all this nice stuff to that. Oh, you're gonna be a NATO [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1772.1999999999998s)]
*  We're gonna do joint NATO military training with the Ukrainian military. We're gonna give you weapons [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1775.56s)]
*  We're gonna give you aid you stand up to Russia and don't worry [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1780.86s)]
*  You're gonna be a part of the Western world [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1783.36s)]
*  But really what we were encouraging them to do was pick a fight with Russia that we were not truly gonna have their back in [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1785.1999999999998s)]
*  And so, you know what? I mean, it's like it so in a lot of ways and then of course [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1792.04s)]
*  It does at least seem I mean look I'm not pretending I can get inside Zolinski's head [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1797.56s)]
*  But it does at least seem like Zolinski was interested in that initial peace [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1802.08s)]
*  Agreement after Vladimir Putin had invaded and that it was Boris Johnson as an agent of the West, you know [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1807.48s)]
*  Who who basically forced his hand out of it and made him have and so? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1814.02s)]
*  Ukraine kind of is a victim in all of this but at the same time [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1819.28s)]
*  The reality is that Ukraine doesn't really have a seat at the table here [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1823.9399999999998s)]
*  And no people don't like to hear that they like to go [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1827.74s)]
*  Why doesn't Ukraine get to decide about Ukraine's future? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1830.5600000000002s)]
*  It's like because the world doesn't work that way and what's going on in Ukraine is not a war between [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1833.78s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia what's going on in Ukraine is a proxy war between the United States of America and Russia [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1840.0600000000002s)]
*  Yes, and right and not even the current administration so sorry to negotiate here actually really just requires the US and Russia [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1849.22s)]
*  look the [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1857.7s)]
*  the [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1859.7s)]
*  the whole barisma scandal that [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1860.78s)]
*  That that Joe Biden found himself in because the barisma was if you guys remember the Ukrainian natural gas company [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1864.3000000000002s)]
*  That was put hunter Biden on the board was paying him like 150 grand a month to be on a board of a Ukrainian energy [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1870.3200000000002s)]
*  Company he has no experience in the energy sector and doesn't speak Ukrainian [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1877.26s)]
*  But they needed his valuable insight on this board. So, okay [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1881.8200000000002s)]
*  Obviously what happened was they were a company they were very in bed with the Yanukovych government [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1885.7800000000002s)]
*  Barack Obama and Joe Biden was vice president and kind of in charge of Ukraine policy date the Obama [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1891.98s)]
*  Government backed the coup against Yanukovych and over and overthrow him [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1898.9s)]
*  Okay [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1904.22s)]
*  So then this government and this this company barisma is freaked out because they were in bed with a government who was just overthrown [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1904.74s)]
*  Okay, and so they wanted to ingratiate themselves to the new government and so what did they do [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1911.58s)]
*  Instead of bribing one of the you know officials in the purging co-government. They just went right to the source [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1917.74s)]
*  Well, we'll just well we'll pay off the vice president of the United States of America's kit [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1923.98s)]
*  So it's essentially my point is that was even a recognition then [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1928.72s)]
*  Of who was really in charge? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1933.98s)]
*  We can't forget the purging co-government go go bribe off a Biden that's what'll really get you security [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1936.58s)]
*  Okay, so like they knew what they needed to do to really get security and know the the truth is that [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1943.14s)]
*  there's [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1950.02s)]
*  The Ukrainians don't really need to be involved in these negotiations. This is [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1951.7s)]
*  If the US is pulling support [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1956.8600000000001s)]
*  Good luck, so Lenski. What does the lens you do then if Donald Trump goes? Hey, well, that's I put together the agreement [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1959.5s)]
*  You're giving up these territories the war is over. You're not getting into NATO and here's a security guarantee [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1965.6200000000001s)]
*  Which will be a nonsense whatever guarantee that the Russians won't continue to take territory [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1969.82s)]
*  But what's the lenski gonna do? I don't take the offer and then Donald Trump goes. All right Putin you can have it [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1974.3s)]
*  Well, we'll stop you if you get to Poland. Well, it's kind of like [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1979.26s)]
*  It'd be like if [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1984.06s)]
*  Let's just say like you're out with a girl Rob and [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1987.18s)]
*  She said there's you're at a bar with a girl and she goes [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1991.62s)]
*  You know, this guy is like this guy's like being a creep [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1995.54s)]
*  He said something creepy to me and then she goes to him. She goes well this guy Rob [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=1999.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm with is gonna kick your ass or something and then you start talking to him and you guys are talking shit [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2003.06s)]
*  And then it's like hey guys, we don't want to have a bar fight here. So Rob, why don't you and this guy? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2008.0s)]
*  Just talk this out. Okay, and then I were to say well really the chick should get involved in these conversations, too [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2013.18s)]
*  Because it's not a true piece unless all three of you agree that this it's like no [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2021.02s)]
*  Sorry, no, because these are the two ones here who are actually capable of fighting. Look there are there are [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2026.3s)]
*  Three great powers in the world right now [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2032.5s)]
*  Okay, the three great powers are the United States of America China and Russia and in that order [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2035.58s)]
*  Okay, that is two of the great powers in the world are fighting a proxy war here [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2042.1s)]
*  That's the story between the two of us we have I think 90% of the world's not nuclear stockpile [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2047.34s)]
*  Okay, that's the conversation here is to define peace between America and Russia [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2053.46s)]
*  Zelinsky ultimately as always is gonna have to do what he's told and like you said all it takes is [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2060.46s)]
*  Okay, if the US just goes we're pulling every ounce of support out that we have [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2067.56s)]
*  Then he has to do whatever Putin tells him to do [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2071.7400000000002s)]
*  So like it there's just there it doesn't matter and Europe and NATO all of them [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2074.44s)]
*  That's just the European wing of the American Empire [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2080.88s)]
*  Period there's no this is on the level of like, I don't know [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2084.92s)]
*  what [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2090.2799999999997s)]
*  You know if it was like the Soviet Union and you were like, okay. Well, we got to deal with with Moscow [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2091.36s)]
*  We got to negotiate with Moscow and you were like now. I really think what you want to do is talk to Estonia [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2097.1s)]
*  It's like no, that's just that's just a satellite of the Soviet Union that is not, you know what I'm saying [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2104.6s)]
*  Like this is not a different player here [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2110.12s)]

*  Worth playing let's play the clip from 60 minutes where there is a conversation with [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2183.02s)]
*  between CBS and three [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2189.86s)]
*  German prosecutors I will say to walk back my earlier comments about not caring that much about the [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2192.38s)]
*  Internal politics of European countries. I will admit that this is chilling if you ask me. So let's let's play that clip [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2199.58s)]
*  Is it a crime to insult somebody in public? Yes [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2207.78s)]
*  And it's a crime to insult them online as well. Yes, the fine could be even higher [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2212.42s)]
*  Yeah, if you insult someone in the internet [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2218.7000000000003s)]
*  Why because in internet it stays there if we are talking here face to face you insult me and so do okay finish [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2221.34s)]
*  But if you're in the internet if I insult you or a politician that sticks around forever. Yeah [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2229.6600000000003s)]
*  the prosecutors [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2235.54s)]
*  Also prohibits the spread of malicious gossip violent threats and fake quotes if somebody posts something [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2238.1s)]
*  That's not true. And then somebody else reposts it or likes it [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2245.42s)]
*  Are they committing a crime in the case of reposting? It is a crime as well because [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2250.42s)]
*  The reader can't distinguish whether you just invented this or just reposted it. That's the same for us [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2255.58s)]
*  The punishment for breaking hate speech laws can include jail time for repeat offenders [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2262.18s)]
*  Is it a crime to insult somebody in public? Yeah, so this is a I mean [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2267.7s)]
*  What can you say about that? That's really creepy [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2274.14s)]
*  The guy I mean, I guess this is the type of stuff that prevents a Holocaust Rob [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2277.66s)]
*  Well, not when the government's in control of what it gets to say is true or not true information [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2283.3399999999997s)]
*  And if you learned anything from co vid it's they're not that good at that [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2288.86s)]
*  But the guy in the middle, I mean he looks like Eric Idle and the first time I was watching this [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2293.46s)]
*  I didn't think you had sent me a real news clip where he's like, no, it's even more dangerous when it's online [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2297.82s)]
*  What are you talking about? What how is that? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2302.98s)]
*  Because it stays and she's like all the logic this brilliance of this man [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2305.46s)]
*  It can stay online forever or it could just evaporate with the thousand other tweets that get sent off every two seconds [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2309.96s)]
*  I mean [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2316.6200000000003s)]
*  You're looking at I didn't realize that a Germany [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2318.7400000000002s)]
*  Was this a Toletarian? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2322.6600000000003s)]
*  But obviously free states can't have that you're not allowed to say offensive things in person or on the internet [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2324.7000000000003s)]
*  Because who gets to determine what is true and what's offensive and if you said something politely or not politely [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2332.2200000000003s)]
*  You're just seating over power to the government to you know, get people in trouble. It doesn't like oh, I mean it's look [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2338.7000000000003s)]
*  It's with all of these things and it's the same thing whether you say, you know as they say their thing [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2345.28s)]
*  insults or [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2351.1200000000003s)]
*  Frankly, I find Jews offensive just their very existence [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2352.6400000000003s)]
*  They got ratty faces. So anything they say it's just a ploy from them to try and use their Jew tricks to take my money [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2355.52s)]
*  So if anything, I this is you know [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2361.88s)]
*  We might have to restore free speech just for the Jews to continue to be able to exist in Germany [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2365.7200000000003s)]
*  well, look, I mean that's that's probably gonna affect our [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2370.48s)]
*  YouTube numbers in Germany, but uh, sorry, I apologize to our German listeners [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2374.7999999999997s)]
*  But it is I mean, you know, obviously right? I mean this is it's so weird because it's such a basic [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2380.36s)]
*  Argument that you can't even imagine that anybody's still having it today [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2386.3199999999997s)]
*  But it's this is what I argued with David Cross about back in when we were on that panel together in like [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2390.36s)]
*  2018 or whatever that was but it's like now you're gonna sit here and say oh [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2397.08s)]
*  We need censorship, but we're only gonna ban lies [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2402.2s)]
*  It's like alright. I mean that sounds nice except who gets to be the one who determines [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2405.64s)]
*  What is the truth and what is a lie and you know, like I mean you could think about so many [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2411.36s)]
*  Contentious political issues where the that's what the whole debate is about [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2417.4s)]
*  Then it becomes this thing where you're just presuming the conclusion to say that your side is the truth and the other side is a lie [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2422.56s)]
*  But it's the same with insults, right? Like even you're gonna say [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2430.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, we're just saying people aren't allowed to insult each other [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2434.52s)]
*  But then who gets to determine what's an insult and what's not? I mean, I'm sure you know [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2437.78s)]
*  We've all had this experience where somebody has told you just in life forget even like political disagreements [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2442.8s)]
*  But we've always had all had this experience just in a disagreement in an argument where someone's like offended by what you said [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2449.5s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, well, I'm offended by what you said. So what is it? Where does that get us, right? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2456.6s)]
*  We're right back to square one. I've had it [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2462.04s)]
*  Happens to me constant listen as somebody and I've been known to throw out a few myself too [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2465.0s)]
*  But as somebody who gets insulted constantly on social media, which is we're gonna say those people should face jail time [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2469.6s)]
*  For insulting me like what like somehow you have some conception of rights [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2477.3199999999997s)]
*  Where I have the right to not be insulted but you don't have the right to speak your mind [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2484.3199999999997s)]
*  Like think about how backward that is how sick that is and and like again, you know who? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2491.6s)]
*  After living is German insulted court work. How does that work? You show up I was insulted [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2498.48s)]
*  With the planes by queers, I don't know. Yes, I would honestly think that I think and I mean this very genuinely Rob [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2505.6s)]
*  I think we would both find what those three prosecutors just said both offensive and insulting [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2512.78s)]
*  He declined my invitation to a party. I'm insulted now what you got in jail because you're anti-social [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2519.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean it really is you know, it's something and of course by the way [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2525.5s)]
*  He let it slip that if you insult someone or a politician, whoo. I wonder why that's what came to your mind [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2530.1200000000003s)]
*  I wonder why what a coincidence that that's the first thing you thought of was a politician [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2535.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, because that's all this is always about is whether or not you can dissent from your government [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2539.88s)]
*  and [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2545.6400000000003s)]
*  you know again like it's just funny like the people who are out there like, you know again [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2546.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know enough about like European politics, but give me a break that they are not insulting people [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2554.2400000000002s)]
*  You know what? I mean like the idea that these people are you not insulting the people who you wish to censor? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2559.6400000000003s)]
*  But look all of this stuff [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2566.1600000000003s)]
*  It always [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2568.7999999999997s)]
*  It just comes down to like if anybody's going to have this power [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2570.4399999999996s)]
*  Where you get to determine what type of speech is allowed and is not allowed it will always be corrupted because there's no way [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2575.7999999999997s)]
*  For it not to be [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2582.9399999999996s)]
*  You know the idea that you're gonna sit here and determine I mean and of course, right? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2584.7599999999998s)]
*  All of this stuff is always they don't mean any of the stuff [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2590.08s)]
*  As you pointed out at the beginning of the show is never actually about democracy [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2594.3399999999997s)]
*  It's about their rule and it's never actually about disinformation. It's about their rule [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2598.46s)]
*  that's all that matters and you know, we we lived for [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2603.74s)]
*  for [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2608.66s)]
*  years under the COVID regime here in America and [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2610.14s)]
*  What was the motto the entire time of the regime? It was follow the science [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2613.7799999999997s)]
*  Which is you know, just another way of saying follow the truth, right? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2618.02s)]
*  This is the official truth [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2622.2599999999998s)]
*  TM this is being given, you know, this is what's coming down from Pravda [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2624.58s)]
*  So this is the truth you must follow this truth except like it wasn't true and I'm sorry [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2628.74s)]
*  I'll put our track record of telling the truth up against any of theirs [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2634.7s)]
*  But there was net but like that's what they'd be talking about and look there might be other examples where there is actually [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2638.06s)]
*  Disinformation but still you're gonna give the government the power to censor that shit. Oh [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2644.94s)]
*  Good luck. Good luck dealing with the the results of that [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2650.9s)]
*  All right, let's see here let me maybe I'll check in on the [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2656.38s)]
*  Chat for a minute see if anyone's got a question if you got a question throw it in the chat [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2660.34s)]
*  Maybe we'll get to one or two then I did have another [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2664.12s)]
*  Got another couple topics here. So we'll cover what we can [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2667.62s)]

*  All right, you know what we could let me see we got time to why don't we go did you see this is people are getting [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2694.76s)]
*  very upset about this, but did you see the [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2702.32s)]
*  Tom Hanks was on Saturday night lives like 50th anniversary rub. Did you watch any of it? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2705.58s)]
*  All right. I watched very little of the 50th anniversary [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2711.18s)]
*  For some reason I am just over celebrating SNL. It's kind of annoying me [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2714.7s)]
*  I have maybe that's just jealousy and pettiness whatever [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2720.1s)]
*  But people were very upset with this sketch and I watched three quarters of it just to see what people were upset about [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2724.18s)]
*  I thought it was fine and funny. I didn't think that there was the character type was that I it seemed like [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2730.94s)]
*  woke [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2737.7400000000002s)]
*  Charonism from the right that they seem to have been upset with the sketch or the parody. I thought it was actually funny [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2738.7000000000003s)]
*  I thought I'd like the game of the scene in sketch terms was funny that [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2744.82s)]
*  conservative right-wing people have the same thoughts and attitudes as like black people on certain [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2749.66s)]
*  Distrust of government I didn't think it was I don't even know why people were bothered by it. Maybe maybe you felt otherwise [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2755.62s)]
*  But let's let's play the clip and then and then let's I mean [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2761.54s)]
*  I guess it was a little similar to his Forrest Gump character [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2764.74s)]
*  And then maybe that was a what people are taking issue with but I did see a little bit of that [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2767.2999999999997s)]
*  You did see Forrest coming up a little bit in that character here. Let's play the clip and then we can discuss [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2771.94s)]
*  I don't entirely disagree with you [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2776.02s)]
*  Oh, thank you. Hey speaking the church. Can I say something if more folks went to church? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2778.02s)]
*  We wouldn't be in this mess. We're in now, you know what? I agree with you Doug. I'd like to shake your hand, sir [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2784.22s)]
*  Here we go [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2789.66s)]
*  I didn't get to this part of the sketch [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2798.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I don't know it didn't really land but at the same time you're like [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2801.34s)]
*  I could see what they were going for was to be funny kind of there [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2808.06s)]
*  Look, I guess like what people I think the thing that people are objecting to but I don't think it's anything [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2811.5s)]
*  Like look, I really just don't despite [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2818.58s)]
*  Despite the arguments about the woke right stuff over the last couple months, which has been fairly silly [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2822.54s)]
*  Um, I really just don't have a woke bone in my body [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2827.94s)]
*  Like I just don't you're like they're trying to be funny from their own lens or whatever [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2831.58s)]
*  You know now I understand you could say that like look there [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2837.22s)]
*  They'll never take the gloves off with like a Kamala supporter or something like that or they'll never be like hey [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2840.74s)]
*  let's do let's uh, let's do a [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2847.2599999999998s)]
*  character caricature of like, you know a hood black [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2849.98s)]
*  Obama supporter or something like that, but they will kind of take the gloves off with Trump supporters [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2854.74s)]
*  Like yeah, and that's why they're less and less relevant than they've ever been before. It's like I don't know [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2859.22s)]
*  I guess I'm more or less with you. I will call things out for for not being funny and [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2864.2599999999998s)]
*  We certainly have seen a lot of comedy where there was no comedy [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2870.54s)]
*  We've seen it with the late-night shows where there's no joke there [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2874.46s)]
*  It's just might as well be the news telling you why they don't like Trump. There's literally not the [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2877.38s)]
*  Structure or trying to tell a joke. They're not even going for laughs. Yes in this particular sketch [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2883.1s)]
*  Listen, I'm not ever gonna work at SNL [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2889.38s)]
*  I don't know that I'd be qualified to work at SNL [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2891.42s)]
*  they spent too much time with the the two black characters playing their silly game of [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2893.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, I guess what's relevant to black people. Maybe I'm starting to sound racist [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2899.06s)]
*  That was not that funny the actual Tom Hanks lines in the sketch. I was like, okay, I get the joke here [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2903.5s)]
*  There's a joke here [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2909.2200000000003s)]
*  It's not just woke agenda nonsense [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2909.9s)]
*  Dem it like there was an actual joke there of that [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2911.9s)]
*  The conservative Republican has the exact same distrust as government as these black like and it was that was actually I wasn't laughing [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2914.62s)]
*  I felt out funny, but there was enough of a joke there. I'm like, all right [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2921.34s)]
*  I don't this last piece a little bit more agenda, but I didn't even make it that far [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2923.42s)]
*  That's how interested I was I watched the first 40% to go. This is nonsense Republican complaints [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2928.54s)]
*  the thing about it is right is that it's [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2933.6200000000003s)]
*  In a way, you know, they're in a they're in a in a pickle [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2937.86s)]
*  I mean the people at you know, the people at Saturday Night Live and [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2942.34s)]
*  Hollywood and and you know, obviously the people in the corporate media [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2947.3399999999997s)]
*  But like the the late night hosts and Saturday Night Live and people in Hollywood, you know [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2952.06s)]
*  they went all in on this kind of like demonization of Donald Trump and of Trump supporters and [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2957.2999999999997s)]
*  the the problem of course was that this blinded them to everything else and [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2965.02s)]
*  And particularly blinded them to why people supported Donald Trump because they didn't just see [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2970.66s)]
*  Donald Trump they saw the other actors in the room, too [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2976.62s)]
*  But when you hate Donald Trump with such a singular focus you blind yourself to all this other stuff [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2979.7799999999997s)]
*  And then of course, that's what led them to support Joe Biden [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2985.24s)]
*  And that's what led them to pretend Joe Biden wasn't senile for all these years [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2988.06s)]
*  But after four years of Joe Biden they wake up in this new world where like for the first time [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2992.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, we watched [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=2999.18s)]
*  CNN as they explained those numbers to us [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3001.7400000000002s)]
*  Remember they kept underlining them so that we could see the difference between the numbers [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3003.86s)]
*  But like really aside from a few days in his first term, but for the first time Donald Trump is popular [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3007.94s)]
*  The Donald Trump has a net positive approval rating and so most Americans [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3015.62s)]
*  Or at least most voting Americans support Donald Trump [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3022.7400000000002s)]
*  So it's just you know what they're struggling with is like well while you're trying to caricature [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3026.86s)]
*  The Trump supporter the Trump supporter in reality is most of us [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3033.18s)]
*  That's just the new political reality that we're in and so now if they're if their game is gonna be demonizing most [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3039.78s)]
*  Americans [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3047.94s)]
*  You don't need to be the woke outrage police [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3049.66s)]
*  The markets gonna take care of this on its own and of course it has been you know [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3052.82s)]
*  It has but it's like all of these people have been losing viewers for years now [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3057.3s)]
*  And so, you know it in a way to me, you know, I saw a little bit [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3061.6200000000003s)]
*  I didn't watch the whole thing [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3066.5s)]
*  but I saw a little bit of the event and it was kind of sad to me because I [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3067.44s)]
*  Grew up such a huge Saturday Night Live fan and it's all lame [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3070.98s)]
*  Everything I tried to check out just wasn't hitting and the rehash and old bits and it's just not fresh and funny [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3075.1000000000004s)]
*  And you know, it was interesting for me because I've never watched SNL. I've never watched it [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3080.7000000000003s)]
*  it's never been a show that I watched and [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3085.1800000000003s)]
*  The wealth of talent that came off of that show and then went on to do the funniest things in the entire world [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3087.02s)]
*  And then I go back and watch this and just I listen it doesn't appeal to me [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3092.32s)]
*  Whatever, but then it's funny because everyone's celebrating the thing and you're like, alright, let's go check it out [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3095.8s)]
*  it's the best comedians in the entire world, these are the most talented people in the world and [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3099.98s)]
*  Miss after miss of lameness and lameness really alright, this is why am I even trying to get into this? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3105.54s)]
*  I'm I don't watch the show when it's the show [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3110.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's uh to me. It's just kind of like look [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3113.22s)]
*  The last ten years really have [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3119.5s)]
*  The the the mainstream [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3123.54s)]
*  Which is no longer the mainstream has just been so broken that it's like not capable of producing [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3126.46s)]
*  Greatness anymore. It's kind of unfortunate, but that's just the kind of where we are [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3134.98s)]
*  Like it's just these guys are just not there. They're so [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3140.42s)]
*  Just not tuned in to the new moment [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3145.46s)]
*  it's I mean talk about by the way is an example of this right is [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3149.7799999999997s)]
*  When I know we played it on the clip and I we ruthlessly mocked him, but he deserves it [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3155.1s)]
*  But when Chris Cuomo said that [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3160.3s)]
*  Now that the podcast space has become the place [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3163.5s)]
*  You're gonna see all the a-list talent going there and it won't be me and Jill Rogan anymore because it'll be [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3167.54s)]
*  Louis CK and Stephen a Smith are gonna come in and take over the podcasting world [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3174.7400000000002s)]
*  And he's just like man talk about not having your finger on the pulse [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3180.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, they just talk by the way, you know, it's just Louis CK is one of the greatest comedians ever [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3184.42s)]
*  I am not at all arguing his talent [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3188.5s)]
*  But the idea that he's gonna go replace Rogan is like the podcast guy like you just don't know. I don't know it's it's [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3190.38s)]
*  there's a great thing about radio, which is it it is its own medium and [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3198.5s)]
*  Louis CK is one of my all-time favorite comics [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3202.86s)]
*  They actually did this three-hour stint firstly all of his appearances on Opie and Anthony are incredible [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3205.54s)]
*  He was great on that show [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3210.54s)]
*  the best one is with Donald Rumsfeld when he keeps asking Donald Rumsfeld if he's a lizard and [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3211.82s)]
*  Then also you can find this if you want to do a deep dive he once on the ONA channel like hosted this [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3215.9s)]
*  three-hour thing on a Saturday night and he's just kind of [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3221.7000000000003s)]
*  Uncomfortable doing it and talking about how he shouldn't be there and there's this weird meta moment where someone calls him in to try [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3225.26s)]
*  And coach him with how we should handle the show and the listeners so stupid that he doesn't realize he called into something while it's live [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3231.3s)]
*  And Louie's just like agreeing with the guy of like, yeah, you're absolutely right [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3237.78s)]
*  I should probably incorporate if that I'm gonna do like it makes no sense [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3241.4s)]
*  Anyways with all that said Louie's a super talent [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3244.98s)]
*  They try and launch people into the podcast space all the time and they're not radio people [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3248.6600000000003s)]
*  That's what this is and they stink at it [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3253.98s)]
*  So like you're just you're just objectively wrong [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3256.26s)]
*  You can bring the biggest Fox News anchors and hand them podcasts and you're gonna find out [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3258.46s)]
*  Oh, they're not that interesting or good [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3263.34s)]
*  They were platform by Fox News and you could bring by the way, I think Bill Murray is one of the funniest people ever [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3265.42s)]
*  He's a movie star. I don't think he'd be a great podcaster. Yeah [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3270.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it might it might be interesting. I like the first episode Bill Murray sitting down for drinks with someone that might be interesting [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3273.82s)]
*  I don't know that he really knows how to conduct an interview or that he's [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3280.5s)]
*  Not good when he's kind of just responding and doing the sarcastic Bill Murray aloof thing. I don't think he hosts a show [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3284.1400000000003s)]
*  That's not what he does [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3290.84s)]
*  So it's just dead wrong when people look at it, you know, it's like throwing a boxer into MMA [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3292.52s)]
*  He might be a great boxer. That doesn't mean he can do MMA [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3297.6200000000003s)]
*  No, that's it that's exactly right and then just to take it a step further like when you're talking about in this kind of you know [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3300.6200000000003s)]
*  space of political commentary or whatever [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3309.0600000000004s)]
*  It's like oh, no [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3312.1400000000003s)]
*  There's like there's a huge current thing going on that Joe Rogan taps into and to think that you could just take [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3313.26s)]
*  Anybody and put them in that role of that they'll tap into that too again. It is it's the old-school [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3320.7000000000003s)]
*  Mentality of like oh, well if the CNN 8 p.m [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3328.06s)]
*  Hour leaves you plug someone else in there and then they get that audience. It's like that's not how this new game works, dude [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3331.46s)]
*  it's just a different thing and [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3337.5s)]
*  That was one of the things to me. That was just very there was very apparent [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3340.02s)]
*  Watching the Saturday Night Live thing just for the little bit that I did that it's like [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3344.54s)]
*  Oh, you guys just aren't you're not tapped into what's going on now [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3348.08s)]
*  You just don't get and it's a shame in a way because there would be a lot of really funny shit you could do with it [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3352.2999999999997s)]
*  But you're just not you're not able to because you don't even get it [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3358.7799999999997s)]
*  You don't even really understand like in the same way that like during during the Cultural Revolution of the 60s [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3361.74s)]
*  There was just no way that like your grandma was gonna produce great comedy about it [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3369.22s)]
*  She didn't really get it [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3374.58s)]
*  She doesn't even really know what in her mind what she's thinking of that is a weird [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3375.8999999999996s)]
*  Caricature of what's actually going on where's like somebody in you know, like George Carlin might be able to make it really hilarious [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3380.1s)]
*  Because he got it. He was of it, you know, and like that that's the thing is that these guys [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3386.7400000000002s)]
*  Particularly in the podcast scene they are of this new world [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3392.42s)]
*  Like they they know it because they are it and these other guys are dinosaurs [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3396.18s)]
*  They just don't understand what they're even commenting on. It's like [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3400.54s)]
*  Like listening to what was Elon's guys? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3405.42s)]
*  Troll name or whatever [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3408.3799999999997s)]
*  Big balls, giant balls, little balls, tiny nuts [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3410.3799999999997s)]
*  It's listening to CNN talk about big balls and it's like, oh you don't even understand the you don't even understand the kind of troll culture [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3412.3799999999997s)]
*  Like you just don't even get what it is. You couldn't possibly analyze it. There's just so many steps behind [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3422.3799999999997s)]
*  The fact that a brilliant wizard kid who once at 12 years old had a name Harry balls [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3427.3799999999997s)]
*  Like well, then where are you gonna find a good autist to work at your company? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3432.3799999999997s)]
*  If everyone who had a funny right Twitter handles out off the off the books gonna have to hire from India [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3435.54s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is monetary metals [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3441.54s)]

*  That's monetary-metals.com [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3524.02s)]
*  All right, let's get back into the show [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3527.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's right here before we before we wrap up [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3530.02s)]
*  I also did want to play this just because I thought this really was was great, but it's on kind of the similar topic [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3533.02s)]
*  But here is Ben Stiller being interviewed by another guy who I was arguing on Pierce Morgan with [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3540.18s)]
*  I can't remember his name, but another guy who I just talked about didn't get it [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3547.18s)]
*  But here is Ben Stiller and having a conversation about, you know, how he feels about going forward in Trump's second term [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3552.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think we probably I don't I don't I think we're going to be able to do that [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3561.18s)]
*  I don't I don't I think everybody's going to have their own personal reaction and it's impossible not to be aware of the fact that people feel this [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3568.3399999999997s)]
*  You know that oh wow, you know, there can be retribution from the government if you say something wrong and that's really scary [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3579.3399999999997s)]
*  So just even be thinking that way is but you know, of course I'm aware of it. I think everybody's aware of it [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3586.3399999999997s)]
*  And you know, certain people are just naturally more outspoken and always have been and I I've sort of like, you know, had my own path with it [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3592.5s)]
*  But right now, yeah, I think it's it's it's definitely a thing that people feel and in a way for me [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3601.5s)]
*  It makes me think about it even more about what do I really want to say and how do I really feel about something? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3609.5s)]
*  And I think for artists in times like these that their creative energy really goes into expressing what they feel and there's a lot of them [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3614.66s)]
*  It is I don't know. It's hard to even come up with the words for just how like it's flabbergasting [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3625.66s)]
*  I guess to hear like rich Hollywood A-listers talk about the fear that they have to live with now that there might actually be retribution from the government [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3638.8199999999997s)]
*  For what they say, you know, it's like it's to be in a position as as me and you have both been for years [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3651.8199999999997s)]
*  And again, Elon Musk just bought Twitter not that long ago, the kind of like this pendulum swing is very, very new [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3660.98s)]
*  But we were for years in a situation where like we're guys who are like hustling to, you know, keep this show going and keep our careers going [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3668.98s)]
*  And you're under real threat of like being shut down being like there was a time there where people were being just plucked and removed from the conversation [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3681.14s)]
*  Shut down with all of the big companies colluding shutting people like Alex Jones say shutting him down off everything [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3692.14s)]
*  It is a real, you know, like when we're in this game when there was the real threat of like you could lose access to iTunes, YouTube, you know, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, everything [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3700.2999999999997s)]
*  And just be unpersoned essentially and nobody stood up for like the guy who's who's making a salary [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3712.2999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? Doing this losing everything. But now I'm supposed to feel for the real victims, which are what Hollywood actors worth hundreds of millions of dollars [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3721.46s)]
*  Who in some theory think that there could be retribution from the government is a very bizarre like it's a very bizarre thing [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3733.46s)]
*  It's like if you like if some country got liberated, you know, like if you know, whatever the the commies after the collapse of the Soviet Union or something [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3743.62s)]
*  We're like, you know, you just like now we're worried that they might crack down on us and hey, you know, citizens of Russia, you have no idea what that's like [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3755.62s)]
*  To be worried about a government that might crack down on you like what what how do those words come out of your mouth? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3763.62s)]
*  You guys were the ones cracking down and like I don't know maybe it's maybe it's me but it's like yeah, Ben Stiller [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3770.7799999999997s)]
*  If you do if you have fear about this like sit with that for a little bit and maybe think about it think about actual fear [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3777.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, like I don't know any thoughts on that rub [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3784.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, unless he's actually afraid that some, you know, dollar figures are going to come out of what he was paid by the CIA to back Zelensky or whatever the fuck [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3788.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. Or with but it's so funny with like the funny people like he's a super fucking talent and I've heard him talk about how he couldn't make Tropic Thunder today [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3798.94s)]
*  That's not because of the Republicans. The Republicans aren't the ones that trying to say that comedy is violence and we can't have jokes in this style [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3808.94s)]
*  That's not that's not coming from the conservative party anymore [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3817.94s)]
*  No, that's right. You got to pretend like you're living in a different time period if you want to pretend that the exactly right [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3820.94s)]
*  The ones keeping you from this stuff here. Let's let's just play the rest of this clip and then we'll wrap up. Yeah, I got a pay [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3828.1s)]
*  Go for it. Now wait till yeah, let me go [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3835.1s)]
*  Amazing work coming out of times like these that I hope we see. Yeah, I kind of feel like we didn't get that in the first Trump [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3841.1s)]
*  I don't know why I thought that there wasn't great art in the first Trump that it's wasn't like during that four years you look back on that and feel like feel about it the way that you might about [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3849.1s)]
*  Civil rights movement or right like all this like amazing like kind of music and movies [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3857.2599999999998s)]
*  Why do you think that is maybe the first time around it was more about Trump and then this time around it's more about the realization that our country is really deeply divided [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3862.2599999999998s)]
*  And for me, it's less about the fact that he won by a majority and that many many many people are, you know, willing to go down that road [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3872.2599999999998s)]
*  And what is that? So that's actually something that it's always I think been about and that divide [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3881.42s)]
*  You can pause it there. You have to sort of you can pause it there and I'm done with this with this clip [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3888.42s)]
*  But you know, the truth is that it's just it's so funny to watch this question get asked [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3894.42s)]
*  You know, leaving aside what Ben Stiller says about the country was divided. The country is divided. That's what it's about this time [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3899.42s)]
*  It's like now the country's been divided this whole time. In fact, I think the country is less divided than it's been over the last 10 years [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3905.58s)]
*  That's at least what the numbers seem to indicate. But the question is like, well, why didn't you know, why didn't we see the great art? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3912.58s)]
*  The first time Donald Trump was in like we didn't see like, you know, during the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War or something like that [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3920.58s)]
*  It's kind of known for like the great music and comedy and movies and all of these things that came out of that time [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3927.58s)]
*  But why didn't we see that in the first Trump administration? And the answer is obviously twofold number one [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3932.74s)]
*  Because this was not a crisis like that at all. And I know you want it to be [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3939.74s)]
*  I know that your entire identity is that this was like the civil rights movement all over again, but it wasn't [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3944.74s)]
*  It wasn't like the Vietnam War the civil rights movement. It was nothing like that [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3950.74s)]
*  It was like a guy who you didn't like the way he tweeted won the White House [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3954.74s)]
*  That was what the first four years were and then number two as Rob kind of indicated before it's because your side [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3958.8999999999996s)]
*  But an ungodly amount of arbitrary restraints in so that you couldn't make art [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3965.8999999999996s)]
*  You couldn't make great art anymore because everything was a landmine that you weren't allowed to step on [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3973.8999999999996s)]
*  So there it is. This isn't a great mystery. There's your answer. All right, look, we got to wrap up on that one [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3978.8999999999996s)]
*  Thank you guys for for tuning in catch you next time. Peace [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmbKZMpBxo&t=3984.9s)]
