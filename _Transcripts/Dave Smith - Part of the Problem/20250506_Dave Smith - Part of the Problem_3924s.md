# Dave Smith | Dave Portnoy is Missing the Point | Part Of The Problem 1262
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4)
*  What's up? What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the fire Bernstein. Hey, feeling today, brother. Glad to be home. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=11.96s)]
*  It's the calm before the porch, my friend, the calm before the porch. Well, at least [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=17.44s)]
*  your airport of choice is not the meltdown of the civilized world right now. Like mine [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  is I was literally, I have to book, I was literally going through flights and I'm there [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=29.08s)]
*  like, you know, it's like I'm flying again in like a week and they're like, it's going [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=33.44s)]
*  to be bad for another week. I'm like, okay, so I can't fly at a new work. And then now [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=37.32s)]
*  I got to book flights for our next trip after that. And I'm like, do I take government people [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=42.76s)]
*  at their word that'll be fixed in a week? Like the government told me we needed 15 days [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  to slow the spread. And then we were in lockdowns for a year and a half. So I, I'm not, it's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=52.56s)]
*  amazing how much money there is in the airport business. And that I guess since government [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  doesn't like profits, they're okay with just disrupting an entire industry. I assume the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  FAA positions are actually government staffed and they're not staffed by the airlines. Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=67.8s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Those are government employees. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a government screw up. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=72.39999999999999s)]
*  And of course air air travel is like one of the most highly regulated industries. I mean, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=77.0s)]
*  a lot's made about how like Ronald Reagan, like deregulated to some degree, I think the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=82.24s)]
*  airlines, but there's still like a crazy regulated, you know, industry. And once you get to like [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  that level of regulation, it's basically all government jobs anyway. You know what I mean? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=91.68s)]
*  Like maybe not officially, but it's all like the just the worst, the worst. Everything about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=96.16s)]
*  the airport is so ridiculous. I've been flying now. I take like 40 flights a year, maybe [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  more. I take a lot of flights. I think I've only first noticed that there's actually a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=106.44s)]
*  security fee on your flight ticket and it's not cheap. Like if you just, I think it might be a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=110.4s)]
*  thirty five dollar fee. That's fifteen dollars more than a porch tour ticket. Like what for them [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  to hold you up and and touch your underwear? It's kind of outrageous that it costs them that much [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=124.92s)]
*  to facilitate long security lines. I got to check the price tag on that. I don't know if it ranges [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=130.0s)]
*  differently on flights. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=135.6s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I'm not. I'm not sure. But yeah, I have noticed that before, but it's also just like [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=137.52s)]
*  everything. Do you remember there was the thing where I forget the exact details of this, but [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  this was years ago, like fifteen years ago or something like that. But they did like, you know, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=148.16s)]
*  they, they, they published like the results of the TSA is tests. Like they have these third parties [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=153.76s)]
*  go in and just try. They sneak in like fake explosives and they missed 80 percent of them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=160.0s)]
*  Like for all that shit that we go through, they still like don't get the stuff. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=166.32s)]
*  I don't even know that's possible just with the way that they harass me in my bags. Maybe it's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=172.32s)]
*  just my dumb face. It probably is your dumb face. That's the reason for most of my problems is your [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=176.4s)]
*  dumb face being too closely associated with it. I've traveled with this same shotgun microphone [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=182.4s)]
*  for also 40 flights or something. And I don't remember the airport, but in one airport, they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=188.72s)]
*  pulled me over for it. And the guy was so excited. He really thought he found a gun. And then when [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=194.0s)]
*  he opened it up and he double checked it and then he finally pulled it out and then he had to look [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=199.52s)]
*  at me. It's just a dumb government employee. So all disappointed. Like, so what was this thing? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=203.28s)]
*  It's a microphone. You fucking retard. Well, it's also, I mean, I'm not trying to be, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  he really thought he had something. Look, I'm not trying to be a dick, but like there are [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=212.64s)]
*  different levels of government employees and whatever the TSA is, you know, you're just like, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=218.08s)]
*  you might be better suited to work at Wendy's. I think might be like, like literally the people [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  who are working at the TSA were applying to Wendy's and the TSA and they got the TSA job. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=232.4s)]
*  It is, it's, they're also just, you know, it's one of the things that I just look, I mean, this is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=238.96s)]
*  like, you know, the essence of like libertarianism, one-on-one type stuff, but there is something [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=244.56s)]
*  where you're, you know, it's the problem with government in a nutshell, right? Is that it's, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=250.56s)]
*  it's based on force. So it's not like, you know, you are, um, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=257.04s)]
*  every interaction you have with the government is like, there's this threat of force behind it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=265.2s)]
*  And we all know that on some level. And so like you in any other set in any other setting, like [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=270.16s)]
*  if you go to a business, you're the customer, like, I'm not saying there's, there's not some [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=275.68s)]
*  example where someone was like rude to you in a business, but generally speaking, when you go into [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  any type of voluntary, you know, market action, you, the customer is kind of King. People are nice [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=286.32000000000005s)]
*  to you. They'll try to help you find something. They're trying to get your business. That's the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=294.0s)]
*  whole model here is that we want you to shop with us whenever it comes to something like that. It's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=298.56s)]
*  like, you know, you're essentially the boss when you walk into a store, but when you walk into the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=303.84s)]
*  anything with the government, they're just the boss. They're, they're a monopoly. That's based [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=310.72s)]
*  off force. You have no choice. And so it just breeds this thing where like, you know, in, if you, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=314.48s)]
*  if you walk into the Apple store, it's like, Hey, I'm a customer here. I need this. I need this. And [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=320.48s)]
*  they're like, okay, let me get that for you. But when you walk into the DMV, it's just like, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=327.04s)]
*  wait on the long line. That makes no sense to have you wait on what, you know, like everything's just [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=331.6s)]
*  and with the TSA, it's like, it's all of that. Plus they're the most retarded people you'll ever [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=336.32s)]
*  meet in your life. And no, I got, I did get the other day recognized by a TSA agent who said he's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  a huge fan. So if you're listening, not you, but also if you're listening, you know exactly what [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=351.76s)]
*  the fuck I'm talking about. Cause you work with all these people, but it'll just be things like, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=358.48s)]
*  literally like, even they're just dicks. They're fucking, Oh my God, dude. I mean, like, I, I [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=362.48s)]
*  literally, I got into, I got into a thing with the TSA, which literally almost went bad. Cause one of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  them, cause like they're a dick to me all the time, but like, I'm just trying, I fly all the time and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm just trying to keep it moving. But I was flying with my wife and one of them was real snappy to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=380.0s)]
*  her. And then I started talking shit back to him. And then I just, I could take that to me, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=384.16s)]
*  but you don't fucking talk to my wife that way. And then I said some pretty mean things. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=389.12s)]
*  Well, I always like it when sometimes they have the energy, like they're about to miss a flight. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=393.52s)]
*  And it's like, relax, you can process this slower. You don't have to yell at us. We're not checking [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=400.16s)]
*  into prison. It's not that big of a deal. It's not your problem if someone misses a flight, relax. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=404.56s)]
*  Well, they'll also just be, they'll be rude to you when you ask the most reasonable question. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=410.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. Cause you know, it's funny, I'm in every airport and they all operate differently. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=415.76s)]
*  So sometimes I literally walk up to the thing. I'm like, Hey, his laptop coming out of the bag. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=419.84s)]
*  And they're like, why would you ask me that? Not going to keep it in the bag. Everything goes on. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=423.2s)]
*  That you're like, relax. I was just asking the question. You're, you're one airport. There's a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=426.56s)]
*  hundred of these across the country. They all have a different policy. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=430.96s)]
*  Well, also I've had that happen when it's the same airport with a different policy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=434.32s)]
*  I've literally had that happen where it's like, we got to take laptops out and they're like, no, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=439.68s)]
*  what are you? And I go, Oh, okay. Well we did two weeks ago right here. So it's a pretty reasonable [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=443.6s)]
*  thing for me to ask. But yeah, anyway, I'm literally getting myself angry thinking about that TSA [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=448.48s)]
*  person being rude to my wife. Oh, I was pretty vicious in response to them though. I said mean [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  things anyway. Okay. Let's, let's get into some stuff. That's not just us bitching about flying, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=457.92s)]
*  by the way, we, the reason we fly is to come see you good people. And we will be, I kind of, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=464.56s)]
*  you know, oh geez, I got a busy, a busy month coming up. I guess I'm, I'm always kind of busy [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=469.04s)]
*  these days, but we should let everybody know. Well, first of all, I'll be doing, I'm doing [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=476.32s)]
*  another big podcast that I think you guys will be excited about in a few days here. So that should [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=480.88s)]
*  be at soon. And then the next one we got together is Appleton, Wisconsin. Very excited to do that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  Salt Lake city, Denver, Cleveland, Providence, Tacoma, Spokane, a whole bunch of dates coming up. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  Comic davesmith.com for those, for those ticket links. And, and then also I haven't mentioned it [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=495.12s)]
*  in a while. It is, it's sold out. So you can't come. But I think, you know, I got to check, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=503.04s)]
*  I don't know if it'll be live streamed or not, but I'm debating at the Soho forum. That is my next [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=510.48s)]
*  debate. It's going to be an Oxford style debate on how libertarians ought to feel about immigration. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=516.88s)]
*  I have been, it's coming up in a, in a few weeks here. It's may 20 something. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=523.68s)]
*  And I've literally, it just was like occurring to me today that I was like, I should probably [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=531.28s)]
*  start thinking about that. She probably put my argument together here, but I am, you know, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  I just, I've had so much other stuff going on that I've been focused on, but I am, I am excited [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=542.7199999999999s)]
*  for this because it's, you know, there's like, there's, you know, I've done a lot of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=548.32s)]
*  debates and different styles of debates, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like informal [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=553.6s)]
*  debates where it's just like two people on a podcast arguing an issue. And then I've done [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=561.0400000000001s)]
*  the slightly more formal ones where like there's a moderator and then there's two people arguing [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  about an issue. And then I've done a couple of like Oxford style debates and there's advantages [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=570.4000000000001s)]
*  and disadvantages to both. But there is something about an Oxford style debate where it's a little [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=575.76s)]
*  bit cleaner. You know, you, you get to give your opening statement and then give your rebuttal. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=582.72s)]
*  And then you have a little period to mix it up and then you give a closing statement and then people [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=588.72s)]
*  are going to vote on it and vote on before and after. And you see how many people you could change. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's kind of a, you know, it has been one of my areas of focus for a while now has been trying [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=598.0s)]
*  to get libertarians good on this issue. And I don't know, this is a good opportunity for me, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=607.12s)]
*  I think, because I'm first off, it's at Gene Epstein Soho forum, which is like an amazing [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=615.36s)]
*  debate series there. And it's, you know, it's kind of, it's, it's backed by Reason magazine. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=622.32s)]
*  And it's become kind of like known in the libertarian world as like the kind of [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=629.0400000000001s)]
*  the libertarian debate series. And then I'm debating like Kato's, you know, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=635.7600000000001s)]
*  number one immigration specialist there. So it's a very good opportunity for me to like [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=641.2s)]
*  lay out the case for why libertarians ought to support immigration restrictions. So I'm [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=647.44s)]
*  excited for the opportunity for that. And I believe you're gonna you're gonna do stand up there, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=653.2800000000001s)]
*  right? Yeah. So Rob Bernstein will be there. Some immigration jokes. Got a couple ideas. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=656.8800000000001s)]
*  Hopefully I'll tune them up over Florida weekend. There you go. And then I think we're doing like, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  I think Gene is organizing some type of after party type thing too. So if you are there, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=667.36s)]
*  I hope for those of you who have already bought tickets, it'll be that should be a fun time. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=671.6s)]
*  The Soho forum for a long time was like my home. I think I'm as Gene likes to [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=675.52s)]
*  mention, I believe I hold the distinct honor of being the only person who has, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=684.48s)]
*  I've done stand up opening for the debates many times. And I've also debated and moderated. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=691.84s)]
*  So I've done everything at that series. And I used to back when I had, I had less wives and babies, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=700.4s)]
*  I used to be at every single one of the Soho forums, because I just love going there and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  hanging out. It's like always a great group of people and really interesting debates. And you [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=712.24s)]
*  know, all of that, by the way, when I say less wives and babies, I only have the one wife, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=715.92s)]
*  I haven't gotten any more wives, but I did get more babies. But anyway, so it's kind of like a [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=719.68s)]
*  homecoming type thing. And then I get to kind of lay out my case for why [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=724.6400000000001s)]
*  open borders are insane, and libertarians should oppose them. So I'm very much looking forward to [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  that. And at some point, I'll start thinking about what I'm going to say. It'll be good by the time [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=735.36s)]
*  I get there. Don't you worry. Okay, anyway, let's let's jump into this. This was a topic that I found [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=739.84s)]
*  kind of interesting. And it for a couple of reasons, it hits on obviously the the war in Ukraine, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=746.88s)]
*  which is something we've spent a lot of time talking about over the years. And it also kind [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=753.36s)]
*  of hit on a major theme that I've been talking and tweeting a lot about. So let's play this clip. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=758.96s)]
*  This is from yesterday, Donald Trump was taking questions at the White House. And I thought [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=765.6s)]
*  actually a very one of the better questions that I have heard asked of Donald Trump since he's been [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=770.64s)]
*  back in the White House was was asked of him. So let's play that clip. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=777.2s)]
*  The North Stream pipeline blew up. Yeah, despite what people like John Brennan [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=780.24s)]
*  and all the talk said you were one person who said Russia probably did not blow up its own. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=788.4s)]
*  You can believe they said Russia blew it up. Yeah. And so I'm wondering about your president, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=793.92s)]
*  if you would consider launching a formal investigation into what happened there, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=797.92s)]
*  you actually did blow it up. Well, probably if I asked certain people, I'd be able to tell [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=801.04s)]
*  you without having to waste a lot of money on an investigation. But I think a lot of people know [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=806.64s)]
*  who blew it up. But I was the one that blew it up originally, because I wouldn't let it be built. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=812.88s)]
*  And then when Biden got in, he allowed it to be built. All right. Can you just pause it for a [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=817.28s)]
*  second here? Okay, so part of the reason why I found this so fascinating, right, is that it's [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=820.72s)]
*  first of all, it's a great question. That's one I don't know that I would have thought. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=827.92s)]
*  Huh? Props to Tyler Durden of Zero Hedge. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=832.0s)]
*  Is that who asked the question? Was it a zero hedge guy? We actually know who it was. But [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=835.7600000000001s)]
*  zero hedge has a guy in the room now who got that. Oh, right. Yes. Yes. Oh, okay. I didn't. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=839.2800000000001s)]
*  That's funny. I didn't even realize that as I know who this is asking a question. So giving credit, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=844.72s)]
*  excellent question. I don't know that I would have even thought that way. I mean, I could think of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=850.24s)]
*  some pretty good questions for Trump, but I don't know that I would have thought of that one. But a [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=854.96s)]
*  really good question. And I think in a way it really got to the heart of one of the things that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=857.76s)]
*  me and you have talked about, like that's just been utterly disappointing about this administration. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=863.84s)]
*  But it's like, Oh yeah, that's right. You know, the government commits so many crimes. I almost [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  forget about really major ones. You know, like here's like, it was just, when you asked me to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=875.2s)]
*  rattle off the crimes and like, okay, well they lied us into several wars and they instituted [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=880.08s)]
*  totalitarian lockdowns. They covered up a giant pedophile ring. They framed the president for [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=884.8s)]
*  treason. And then you're like, Oh yeah. And the biggest act of environmental terrorism in human [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=889.3599999999999s)]
*  history. That's right. There's that other one that they did. And then literally this happens [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=894.4799999999999s)]
*  two and a half years ago, the Nord Stream pipeline gets blown up. Joe Biden is on record having [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=900.0799999999999s)]
*  threatened to destroy the pipeline. It's clearly got the West's fingerprints all over it. And they [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=907.92s)]
*  tried to tell you that Vladimir Putin blew up his own pipeline, which he built and he can just turn [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=915.04s)]
*  off. Like he doesn't have to blow it up, blowing it up. Just all it does is not give him the option [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=922.8s)]
*  to turn it back on. And so this question is asked. And then look, I mean, what do you get from Donald [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=929.68s)]
*  Trump here? But he asked the question, are you going to launch an investigation? And Donald Trump [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=934.88s)]
*  goes, well, I wouldn't even need to launch an investigation. I could probably just tell some [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=939.2s)]
*  people and then tell you a lot of people know a lot of people know who did it translation. No, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=942.24s)]
*  there won't be an investigation. Donald Trump. Like, what is this? A lot of people know. I could [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=948.16s)]
*  just ask them and then tell them it's yeah. Could you do that? Would you mind like, can we do that [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=952.8s)]
*  right now? Can you call? Do you have your cell phone on you? Can you call them right now and [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=957.36s)]
*  ask them how like why it's so funny. The level of like, you know, like if you think about all [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=961.28s)]
*  the projection from the corporate media, who was like, if Donald Trump gets in there, he might [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=969.1999999999999s)]
*  prosecute his political opponents. And you know that while they were doing the same thing to him [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=973.12s)]
*  and how much was made over him having that lock her up chance back in 2016. But then you sit like [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=977.6s)]
*  the reality. It's just unbelievable. It's like, here's the funhouse mirror version. And then the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=984.4s)]
*  reality is them going like, Hey, how about this very specific blatant crime that was committed [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=989.36s)]
*  by the previous administration who supposedly guts you hate. You want to tell us about that? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=994.72s)]
*  It's like, no, no interest. And then of course he pivots into this nonsense about how he was [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1000.64s)]
*  really the one who blew it up as if that's a good thing. Cause he got them to stop. You know, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1009.6s)]
*  he got Germany and Russia to stop trading. But I would have blown it up better. Believe me. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1015.28s)]
*  It's also like, you know, it's such a weird, the Nord Stream pipelines are a particularly interesting [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1022.56s)]
*  issue because it exposes like how people think about the world. And, you know, there is a, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1030.3999999999999s)]
*  what's his name? The Stratford guy. I think his name was Freeman. He was the head of Stratford [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1037.68s)]
*  for a while, but he basically what he said, which is kind of an interesting theory is that he was [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1043.76s)]
*  like the entire motivation for us foreign policy post world war II was to always keep the Germans. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1051.6s)]
*  It was always like to keep the Russians out and to keep the Germans down. And that essentially like [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1064.56s)]
*  the big fear from the American empire is like that Germany and Russia would get together. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1071.92s)]
*  Like if they, you know, like this was like, obviously the big fear right before world war II [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1080.0s)]
*  was that, Oh my God, what if Stalin and Hitler met, you know, like, which is kind of interesting, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1085.92s)]
*  like there's, there's a lot of interesting nuggets about world war II, like, like Hitler had a real [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1090.0800000000002s)]
*  affinity for the British empire earlier in his life. Obviously they ended up going to war, but [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1095.04s)]
*  he had like a lot of respect for the British empire. He had a, a deal worked out with Stalin [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1101.28s)]
*  at one point. And like you have, you have like imperialist Britain, capitalist America, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1107.28s)]
*  communist Russia and fascist Germany. And it's not so clear where the partnerships would end up. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1116.3999999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, it's not like such a given that the capitalists and the communists [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1125.52s)]
*  ought to be friends. And you could make a lot of arguments that fascism is a lot closer to the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1129.12s)]
*  system of communism than capitalism is. And, and anyway, so it's just, it's like, you could see where [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1133.52s)]
*  okay, the team of, you know, Britain, us and Russia ends up defeating the Nazis and their [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1142.56s)]
*  allies, Italy and Japan and them, but like, Oh my God, if Hitler and Stalin had gotten together, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1148.7199999999998s)]
*  who, who's to say who wins that? You know what I mean? Like it's, it's not a given. And, and [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1154.96s)]
*  basically what, what Freeman was arguing was that like, there is a, the concern from the American [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1161.52s)]
*  empire was like, if you ever combined the natural resources and the human capital, like the sheer [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1168.08s)]
*  size of Russia and number of people with like German ingenuity, this could pose a real threat [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1175.6000000000001s)]
*  to the, you know, like he would say it in nicer words, like, but this could pose a threat to the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1183.6s)]
*  rules based international order or whatever, you know, the global hegemony, whatever they, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1189.12s)]
*  whatever term they use instead of empire, which just means empire in a different, with different [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1194.48s)]
*  words. But so it's interesting, like, I'm not sure this is exactly right, but it's in, it's an [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1199.44s)]
*  interesting way to look at things. And that, you know, I know for sure, like there was a, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1206.08s)]
*  if you go read, cause there's like notes from the meetings that have been declassified, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1212.6399999999999s)]
*  but there were what's called the two plus four meetings. And then there were like some subsequent [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  meetings after that, like that were the minutes to the meetings have, have been declassified. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1220.8s)]
*  And these are the meetings that were taking place from like 1989, 1990, 1991. So like as the Soviet [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1226.08s)]
*  union is about to collapse and during the meetings, you know, like they're not, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1234.48s)]
*  they're not exactly like certain that the Soviet union is about to collapse, but they're talking [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1240.08s)]
*  about allowing German reunification and pulling back. And there's even talk, I think of, of like, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1244.0s)]
*  dissolving the Warsaw pact and like, so there's like all these, so, so while this is happening [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1251.6s)]
*  and you can read this, like the West is trying to get German reunification. And then a big topic [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1260.72s)]
*  of debate is about NATO expansion. And this is where the not one inch to the East promise, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1266.3200000000002s)]
*  where all those promises are made. And one of the things they're talking about is like, okay, so [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1272.8000000000002s)]
*  at the time, right, during the height of the cold war, or I shouldn't say the height, but during [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1277.68s)]
*  the cold war, I guess this would be not the height, but the end. But so at this time, right, the, the [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1282.4s)]
*  line was drawn right down the middle of Germany. It was down the Elbe river. So the West, West [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1289.6s)]
*  Germany is, is with the West and East Germany is with the East. And they're talking about, you know, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1295.52s)]
*  allowing German reunification. The Berlin wall had just come down like the previous year. And [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1303.1999999999998s)]
*  while they're talking about it, kind of like the Russian beef is like, okay, but like, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1310.0s)]
*  what about NATO now? Because if we reunify Germany, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1314.3999999999999s)]
*  or is NATO now moving East? And this is where the original like not one inch East and they were [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1319.12s)]
*  saying even let Germany be reunified, but NATO military hardware won't move beyond the Elbe [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1324.32s)]
*  river. Like it'll still, we'll still draw the line militarily in the same, but now ultimately, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1330.8s)]
*  even by the end, I think the Russians even accepted that like, that doesn't make any sense. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1335.9199999999998s)]
*  And like, how are you going to reunify Germany, but only the West half of it is has NATO [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1340.48s)]
*  protection and not the Eastern half of it. And anyway, one of the things that's interesting [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1344.64s)]
*  in that, if you read through the notes of the meeting is that what they keep, what they do [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1349.28s)]
*  in a sense to kind of get the Russians to fold and go like, okay, fine, like have Germany under NATO's [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1354.8s)]
*  umbrella is that they keep like, propose it like they float out the idea they go, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1362.56s)]
*  or maybe Germany could just be independent. Like maybe we could just have an independent Germany. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1369.2s)]
*  And then that like sends shivers down every one. Like the Russians are like, whoa, wait a minute, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1374.88s)]
*  hold on. We don't like that. And so there is this interesting thing where like, we may not think of [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1380.0s)]
*  it that way. World War II seems like kind of ancient history, but to a lot of powerful people, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1384.8s)]
*  and particularly this is in, you know, 1990. So this is, you know, it's, it's 50 years or 45 years [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1390.56s)]
*  later, but they still, I mean, this war, you know, 60 million people died in World War II, I think [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1397.68s)]
*  it was 30 or 40 million of them died in Eastern Europe in the war between Russia and Germany. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1405.44s)]
*  And so a lot of anyway, my point is that there's a lot, a lot of people were freaked out over [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1411.76s)]
*  the prospect of there being this pipeline of like Russia and Germany being, becoming allies and [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1418.8s)]
*  doing business together and all of this. And the concern I think is that that could threaten [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1426.16s)]
*  US dominance. And Donald Trump always fell right into that. And that's why he's bragging about, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1432.5600000000002s)]
*  oh, yeah, I was the one who got them to stop being friends. But it's always amazing to me. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1437.76s)]
*  I remember when I debated at Princeton University, it was the last Oxford style debate I did, I [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1442.0s)]
*  debated Josh Hammer. And one of the points he was making was like bragging about the Abraham [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1449.52s)]
*  Accords and how successful Donald Trump was for working them out. And I just kind of made the [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1456.48s)]
*  point. I go, it's a little bit weird for you to brag about the Abraham Accords right now. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1461.12s)]
*  Cause like, I don't know if you've paid attention to the middle East over the last couple of years, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1465.6s)]
*  it's not going great. And so it's kind of, now I'm not saying that like causation is in [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1470.08s)]
*  correlation or whatever, but like, it is a little bit strange. It's an I, the example I used in the [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1475.6s)]
*  debate was I said, it would be like, you're bragging about how you and your wife saw the [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1483.04s)]
*  best couples therapist. Like this guy is the best. It was unbelievable. Like the best thing we ever [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  did. And we go, Oh, so things are going a lot better for you guys now. And they're like, no, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1491.68s)]
*  we got divorced, horrible breakup. But I'm, but man, that couples counseling was so great. So, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1494.8s)]
*  well, it didn't seem to work out that well. And so it's funny that even in hindsight, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1499.36s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't can't even like fathom, and maybe it wasn't a good idea. Maybe we would have [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1503.92s)]
*  been way better off if Russia was more integrated with Europe. Maybe, you know what I mean? Like [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1509.92s)]
*  why it's just crazy. And, and, you know, I think from certainly from my perspective, I go, okay, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1514.3200000000002s)]
*  well look, I don't, first off, I don't care about the American empire. Cause we're not supposed to [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1520.48s)]
*  be an empire anyway. We're supposed to be a Republic and it's been nothing but a disaster [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1524.24s)]
*  for the American people that we've been an empire, not to mention for the countries that we [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1528.0800000000002s)]
*  dominate. But I just look at it on a human level and I go, okay, if the worst thing that ever [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1533.44s)]
*  happened in the history of the world was when Germany and Russia went to war, then it seems [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1541.3600000000001s)]
*  pretty great that they'd be friends. And of course, America comes in to go, no, let's ruin that. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1547.28s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is American [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1554.3200000000002s)]
*  Financing. Prices for the last few years have been and continue to be high and most people, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1558.56s)]
*  unfortunately, have to reach for credit cards to cover bills. Credit card debt has reached an [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1564.8s)]
*  all-time high and it's trapping Americans. This is where American Financing comes in. They can help [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1569.6s)]
*  homeowners pay off high interest debt by using their home's equity. American Financing is a [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1575.28s)]
*  family-owned mortgage lender that's been around for 25 years. Their mortgage consultants are [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1580.96s)]

*  So anyway, it's just all of it is I found this question to be interesting. I found Trump's [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1649.2800000000002s)]
*  answer to be terrible and kind of, I don't know, it illustrates something [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1653.44s)]
*  about first off how he still gets everything wrong about what led up to the war. And also just the [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1660.8000000000002s)]
*  more basic point that I've been harping on for a long time that me and you have talked about for [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1666.24s)]
*  a while, Rob, that it's just like, look, like the crimes that the government has committed are so [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1671.52s)]
*  profound. And you got all these people, Tulsi Gabbard and Dan Bongino and Cash Patel and [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1676.96s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy and Donald Trump himself, who have like been making a living calling out these crimes, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1682.8s)]
*  you know, making their name off of calling out these crimes. I mean, Donald Trump had a name, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1690.72s)]
*  but you know what I'm saying. Even in the question here, Liam points out that it's like, yeah, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1695.36s)]
*  you're the guy. You're the guy who called it out. Hey, I remember two and a half years ago when [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1700.16s)]
*  this happened. And I remember you calling out that this was all bullshit. And yet all of you guys are [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1705.04s)]
*  in power now. And there's just no move. There's no move being made. By the way, Rob, I posted this [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1710.32s)]
*  something of this effect earlier on Twitter today. And I was assured by many Trump supporters, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1716.4s)]
*  you got to give it time, dude, got to be patient. All these guys are going to be brought to justice. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1721.28s)]
*  And it's just like, how I don't know, at what point are you just like, no, they're not. Sorry, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1726.08s)]
*  I wish they were but none of that's gonna happen. Just not a believer, Dave. That is the problem, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1731.36s)]
*  I suppose. Well, and that is true. I am not a believer. I do not believe it at all. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1736.24s)]
*  It's a tough pitch for why Russia in a pre Ukraine environment isn't allowed to sell natural gas [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1743.6799999999998s)]
*  directly to Germany. Other than that you're representing American oil interests, or you [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1750.88s)]
*  think you got to keep down every single nations that they can't acquire wealth. It's just a tough [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1756.5600000000002s)]
*  pitch other than mercantilism that I don't understand how else you kind of justify not [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1762.5600000000002s)]
*  letting other countries freely trade with each other. Yep. No, that's that's exactly right. And [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1768.48s)]
*  also just that, you know, like on top of that, like Germany had embraced all of these insane [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1774.0800000000002s)]
*  climate policies. So I think they got rid of like a whole bunch of their like nuclear power, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1779.52s)]
*  maybe all of it. I don't remember. I remember reading about this years ago, but it was crazy. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1784.48s)]
*  And then it's like, Oh, here comes Vladimir Putin. Like I'll sell you some natural gas at [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1788.4s)]
*  a very reasonable price. And you're like, Oh, so that you mean that would be like really great [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1794.32s)]
*  for the people of Russia and the people of Germany. And then our role is to come in here [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1799.12s)]
*  and be like, no, stay poor. Don't get richer. Just horrible on every level. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1803.44s)]
*  All right, you want to hear you want to move on? I kind of almost reluctantly, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1812.0800000000002s)]
*  but I do want to talk a little bit about this, this Dave Portnoy story, because I just find it [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1816.88s)]
*  fascinating. And the the reaction to it is crazy. So if you if you guys don't know, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1826.0s)]
*  which I don't know that much about Dave Portnoy, I kind of tend to like him. I don't really know, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1832.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, that much. Like, I don't really watch his content that much. I'm just too, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1840.8s)]
*  I'm too busy for like sports content. Just I've just got too much work to do and got [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1845.04s)]
*  little kids and a wife who I try to hang out with every now and then. But I did grow up like a big [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1852.6399999999999s)]
*  sports fan and I still am. I watched the Knicks game the other night. Amazing. He beat the Celtics. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1858.96s)]
*  But he does like, you know, he's like a sports company and they do like, it's just like, it's [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1864.72s)]
*  like dude stuff, I think, you know, like he does like pizza rankings, like he'll go to all the best [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1872.72s)]
*  pizza places in the country and rank their pizza. And then they cover like, you know, the football [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1879.2s)]
*  games, the shit like that. And that's like, even though I don't like really do that anymore, that's [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1884.16s)]
*  like kind of my type of thing. You know what I mean? Like if I was, if when I was 20, I was [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1888.8s)]
*  watching everything on, on, you know, ESPN. If I were 20 today, I'd probably be a huge bar stool [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1894.3999999999999s)]
*  sports fan and ranking pizza seems right up your alley, Rob. It seems like you were only like, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1900.96s)]
*  you were a couple zigs when you zagged away from ending up there rather than here. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1906.96s)]
*  But do you know the bar stool guys at all? Like, do you ever watch any other stuff? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1913.04s)]
*  I, I think he's great. I don't follow everything. I certainly don't agree with all of his political [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1917.5200000000002s)]
*  opinions, but just as a radio guy, he's great when you know, every once in a while I end up on a [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1922.96s)]
*  wormhole of watching his pizza reviews. Every once in a while he, he pops up on the news. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1928.0s)]
*  He's funny. He's a great personality. That's not an endorsement of everything he says or does, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1934.16s)]
*  nor do I watch all of it. But more often than not, when he comes across my feed, I'm like, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1938.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh look, Dave Portnoy and it's entertaining. Yeah. That's kind of how I've felt about him too. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1942.32s)]
*  And then he, he, I think, um, like, I think there was this dynamic that happened to a lot of people. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1947.28s)]
*  I'm speaking on my ass a little bit here cause I don't really like follow them that closely, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1953.2s)]
*  but I think if I'm not mistaken, essentially what happened to him is what happened to a lot of people [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1956.6399999999999s)]
*  is over the years of like woke insanity. Like he was kind of like, Oh, I'm not like political. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1962.24s)]
*  I just want to like be over here and be a dude. And then like the woke people were like, well, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1968.8s)]
*  that's actually a political statement to be a dude. And so you're our enemy. And then they, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1973.28s)]
*  you know, like they almost like started attacking him about everything and then he's a dude. So [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1978.8s)]
*  he's not a pussy. You know what I mean? So like once they started attacking him, it was like, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1985.36s)]
*  no, you know, and started like battling with the woke people. Hey, I'm wealthy and it's awesome. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1988.56s)]
*  And I built this company from scratch and that's awesome. I love, I love that part of his, uh, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1994.3999999999999s)]
*  gang and he's such a winner. He got some massive payout from that gambling company and then bought [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=1999.2s)]
*  back barstool for like a dollar. Yeah. Yeah. Ownership plus all that money that he received [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2003.9199999999998s)]
*  on the buyout, just winter shit. Yeah. Yeah. Can't argue with any of that. So anyway, um, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2008.96s)]
*  look, I, uh, so I'm not coming at this as a guy who like doesn't like Dave Portnoy, you know what [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2016.32s)]
*  I'm saying? Like it's just that I do see, I don't know. I think there's, um, there's like an [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2022.24s)]
*  inability that some people have of how to grapple with like, uh, the Jew hating stuff, but they [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2031.52s)]
*  don't like, and I understand why they don't like it. I don't like it either. Um, but I've always, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2039.36s)]
*  I just like, uh, I think, I think ironically, I suppose that a lot of the people who really [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2044.4s)]
*  prioritize like shutting down the Jew hatred, like we got it. We got to handle this, this problem [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2054.56s)]
*  that people are saying mean shit about Jews. They're, they go about it all wrong and ironically, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2062.2400000000002s)]
*  they end up being the ones who are really feeding that fire. Like if you think this is a problem, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2069.84s)]
*  you're making the problem much worse. So I guess what happened was he had some event at like a bar [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2075.92s)]
*  that he owns doing some sports thing there and someone showed up with a fuck the Jews sign. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2081.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the story. Okay. So here was a Dave Portnoy's, uh, I guess this, this, I guess pictures [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2090.1600000000003s)]
*  were taken and that went up on social media and it was a bit of a scandal. And then this was his, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2096.72s)]
*  uh, video the next day. I believe he called this an emergency press conference. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2101.04s)]
*  Let's play. All right. Emergency press conference time. There you go. So I'm getting ready to go to [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  the bet gala and all of a sudden my phone, the last hour to my phone's fucking blowing up our [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2109.3599999999997s)]
*  bar in Philadelphia, Barstool, Samson street, usually a great fucking bar, you know, bottle [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2116.0s)]
*  service, people buy drinks. You get a sign. There was a sign that said, fuck the Jews. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2121.28s)]
*  I've been shaking. I've been so fucking mad for the last two hours. Like I instantly got on. This [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2128.8s)]
*  is why the emergency press conference was late because I was so over the top. It's like, I'm [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2134.5600000000004s)]
*  going to fucking make it my life fucking mission to ruin these people. Okay. Just pause it right [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2137.92s)]
*  here. I'm never ending. Okay. So I remember, um, when I was a kid, so when I was a, when I was a [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2143.84s)]
*  little kid, like I was around, um, I think I was five, maybe six, five or six. And I moved, uh, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2152.48s)]
*  we moved to this, uh, to a block that was kind of like a tough block. And I wasn't a tough kid [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2161.92s)]
*  at that age. I had never really been, and my parents had already been divorced for years. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2168.08s)]
*  I didn't really have like a father who was like teaching me how to be a man. Um, I'm noticing [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2171.92s)]
*  that now as I'm doing that with a young boy, go, oh yeah, that that's important. Um, and so we moved [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2176.7200000000003s)]
*  to this block. It was like a really tough block. And, uh, I used to get like really viciously [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2183.2000000000003s)]
*  fucking bullied. And it was like these 12 and 13 year olds who used to do it. And, um, and I also, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2190.56s)]
*  and I was going to this, this public school was a pretty, like, I'm not, I'm not like trying to [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2198.48s)]
*  paint a picture. Like I was like, had some like horrible childhood or something, but it was tough. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2202.08s)]
*  It was Brooklyn in the eighties and there were fistfights and there were like these 12 year olds [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2206.08s)]
*  used to fuck us up. And man, when you're six, a 12 year old is like a God. I mean, it's just [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2211.12s)]
*  impossible to even imagine that you could stand up to them. And I was at this school, there were a [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2217.04s)]
*  lot of fistfights at school and stuff. And I remember just literally had a single mom. I'm [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2221.84s)]
*  not blaming her at all. She just didn't know, you know, there's not really the type of thing a mom [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2225.92s)]
*  can help you with. And I just had to figure it out. And eventually I figured it out. I'm kind of [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2230.08s)]
*  figured it out. Like, Oh, you can't be a pussy. You have to fight. Like that's it. It's like, it [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2235.2000000000003s)]
*  sucks, but there's a very basic realization that a lot of men have, um, when they're boys, that it's [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2239.92s)]
*  like, and I just had to figure it out myself that it was like, Oh, getting beat up is not as bad as [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2246.8s)]
*  just getting humiliated. Like it sucks, but you're also kids. They're not like, it wasn't an [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2255.2s)]
*  environment. I'm not like getting curb stomped here. You know what I mean? I'm going to get like [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2260.3199999999997s)]
*  punched in the stomach. It's like, it's not like anyway. So I kind of figured out how to deal with [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2263.52s)]
*  bullies. So, okay. Later in life, this is like much later in life. I think I was in the fifth grade or [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2267.7599999999998s)]
*  maybe the sixth grade. And then I went to like a very soft private school. Uh, so like I went to [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2273.04s)]
*  public school and then I went to private school, by the way, best, uh, you want to make a future [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2280.24s)]
*  libertarian, send someone to public school and private school, let them see the difference [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2285.52s)]
*  between the government and the market. Um, anyway, that's neither here nor there. I remember they [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2289.52s)]
*  brought in, this was like at the very beginning of like anti bullying campaigns and they brought in [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2294.72s)]
*  this chick, like a school psychologist or something like that, that gave us a talk on how to deal with [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2301.04s)]
*  bullies. And one of the things they said was that you, you're supposed to start with an I statement [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2308.08s)]
*  and tell them how their actions are making you feel. And you'd be like, I feel disrespected when [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2315.04s)]
*  you speak to me this way. And I remember just sitting there and being like, yo, I figured out [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2322.48s)]
*  many, many years ago that that is completely wrong. Like that is if somebody is bullying you, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2329.6s)]
*  the last thing in the world you would ever want to do is let them know that it's working. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2336.4s)]
*  That's why they're doing it. Like you can't, that's the fucking incentive for them doing it to begin [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2344.4s)]
*  with. And likewise in this situation, it's just like, it's crazy to me to like, we're grown adults [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2350.08s)]
*  sitting here and you're like, Oh, are you still, so I figured this out at five. You've, you have to [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2356.1600000000003s)]
*  sit here and go, I was literally shaking because this, I'm so angry about this. And this is so [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2362.24s)]
*  wrong. It's like, dude, that's the point. What do you think someone went to a bar in a public event [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2369.2799999999997s)]
*  with a fuck the Jews sign for to blend into the crowd? Or do you think maybe they were trying to [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2377.68s)]
*  trigger a reaction out of you? So how counterproductive is it to just give them this reaction? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2384.56s)]
*  Like it's you just, so now you, this has always been the dynamic, right? And it's like, it's so [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2392.24s)]
*  strange that it's so hard for people to figure this out. Right. But since the rise of even like [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2398.3199999999997s)]
*  the alt right then back in like 2016 or any of that shit, it's like, dude, this guy, I mean, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2404.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know anything about the guy who was holding the sign. I don't know if he's been [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2412.4799999999996s)]
*  revealed on online or whatever, but this guy is presumably no one, right? He's some dude. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2415.68s)]
*  Lady. Oh, was it? Maybe, maybe you're right. I don't know, but maybe Natalie, you're a lesbian. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2424.3999999999996s)]
*  You're going to track down hot chicks. Natalie, you could just what's, what's coming from inside [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2430.3199999999997s)]
*  you right now? What do you feel? Do you know? Can you see him? But you're like, look, presumably [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2436.0s)]
*  whoever this person is, it's like they go there to trigger this reaction and now look what you [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2441.84s)]
*  hand them. They get to have Dave Portnoy saying he's literally shaking. Like it's, do you not get [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2446.8s)]
*  the power play here? You know, like this has always been the thing now that like some 15 year old on [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2454.48s)]
*  the internet can get an editor at the New York times or the owner of the comedy seller or whoever [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2459.76s)]
*  to be like freaking out. It's like, yes, just recognize this takeaway. It was a couple. Okay. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2466.64s)]
*  So, but if you recognize this, you just, you can immediately take away the energy source and go, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2474.32s)]
*  like, okay, whatever. You're like, I don't know what's, what's the appropriate response to this, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2481.6s)]
*  Rob? I would say if it's my bar and someone comes in and holds up a fuck the Jews sign, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2486.4s)]
*  I'd probably have someone from the bar walk over to them and be like, guys, you can't, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2492.56s)]
*  you gotta leave if you have that sign here. You know, can't do that. Then you want to put this [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2498.16s)]
*  on away or you want to, you want to head out somewhere else? Cause you know, this could be [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2503.84s)]
*  handled like that. Like that's it. And it's, and also like, we got to stop. And this is, I mean, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2507.6s)]
*  you can weigh in here, Rob too, but as me and you have been saying for many years, we've got to stop [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2514.88s)]
*  being snowflakes here, dude. Like I don't like Jew hatred any more than anybody else does. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2521.6s)]
*  You know, why would I? It's like against me and my group, it's against my friends and my family. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2528.48s)]
*  And you know, okay, I don't like that, but like, what are we? Are we fucking pink haired 20 year [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2535.2799999999997s)]
*  olds on a college campus somewhere? No, nothing has happened to anybody. No, like it's like, okay. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2541.8399999999997s)]
*  And I really do. The reason I bring up that childhood story, cause I really do think like [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2548.4s)]
*  my childhood for whatever, like informs the way I view a lot of this, or maybe it's just the way [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2553.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm wired or the way I view things. But it's like, I just think it's such a bad idea to ever turn it [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2557.44s)]
*  to start, um, catastrophizing, like very non big deals, like don't do that. This is, it's like, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2566.72s)]
*  if we didn't learn anything from the rise and fall of woke ism, it's like, don't do that. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2577.4399999999996s)]
*  You don't like, if you want people to actually be persuaded over to your side, if you want, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2583.9199999999996s)]
*  like, if that's what you're attempting to do, then the last thing you want to do is be hysterical. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2589.9199999999996s)]
*  And it just, I'm sorry. The reaction to this is hysterical. That's any thoughts, Rob? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2595.28s)]
*  What? What? What? Yeah, I mostly agree with you. I think, I think being not cool doesn't help. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2600.5600000000004s)]
*  It's, uh, and, uh, yeah, I, I, we gotta make people shouldn't have signs. Fuck the Jews. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2611.6800000000003s)]
*  You can make that statement. Hey, no, no coming into my bar with the sign. Fuck the Jews. You're [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2617.52s)]
*  not invited to do that here. Yeah. I mean, we're any group of people. It's like, yeah, come on. You [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2621.68s)]
*  can't do that. Like, I don't know. If you, if you hold that up at a bar, you're probably going like, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2627.04s)]
*  oh, we might get kicked out for doing this. And then they'd be like, listen, you gotta put that [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2631.3599999999997s)]
*  away or you gotta wait. All right. And it was a little bit surprising that people feel comfortable [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2634.56s)]
*  enough to, like, I remember once outside of grand central, I saw some guy on some anti-Jew tirade [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2638.3999999999996s)]
*  and I was a little surprised by the comfort level. And then I guess Jews are such pussies [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2644.56s)]
*  that they'll be like, oh, you shouldn't have the sign. Whereas like with other groups of people, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2648.48s)]
*  if you pulled that shit, you might just get, uh, you might get stomped out on the corner. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2652.8s)]
*  So there is something a little bit, uh, you're talking Asians. I don't know about Asians. You [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2657.36s)]
*  can probably get away with Asians, but there's, there's certainly some groups of people that, uh, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2662.4s)]
*  if you decide to make a very public display in the Times Square area about your hatred of this [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2666.32s)]
*  group of people, I think, uh, you'd be, you know, I'd be surprised that you felt comfortable doing [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2672.4s)]
*  so. And I'd be surprised. I, I'd take the over under on how long until that sign at least gets [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2678.0s)]
*  torn up or someone protests it. Um, so there is something a little bit surprising about that [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2683.52s)]
*  people do have that comfort level to go to public places, uh, you know, with, with signs like that. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2689.12s)]
*  I don't listen, I don't disagree with you on that. And there's, there's no question. I mean, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2695.2s)]
*  there's been a, there's been a, a real rise in the amount of like hostility toward Jewish people on [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2698.8s)]
*  Twitter for sure. And there's, and there's accounts with like a lot of followers who, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2706.16s)]
*  who are way into that shit. And yeah, okay. So I guess that that's a fair point that like it is [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2710.56s)]
*  bleeding over to some degree where someone now feels comfortable enough to go do this at a Dave [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2715.7599999999998s)]
*  Portnoy event. I guess my main point is that like, there's no way anyone did this without this being [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2720.56s)]
*  the intended reaction. Like it's not as if they did this and then thought to themselves like, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2728.3199999999997s)]
*  I bet Dave Portnoy will love this. You know what I mean? Like they're doing this knowing [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2733.36s)]
*  they're going to create that. And I think enjoying it. Hey guys, let's take a moment and thank our [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2738.2400000000002s)]

*  You think I'm going to put up with this shit at my bar. So I've been hunting down waitresses, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2810.7200000000003s)]
*  the table who did it and everything you can fucking name because I want fucking consequences [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2817.12s)]
*  for fucking actions. So I'm not just sitting back like, Oh, what are you gonna know? Trust me, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2824.24s)]
*  I have been on it. I believe the two waitresses responsible the table already fired. I talked to [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2829.44s)]
*  one of them one of the dumbest fucking humans I've ever talked to in my life. She's had a [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2836.08s)]
*  fucking dancer. I said, Oh, she like, can I call you back in 20? No fucking honey, you fucking can't. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2839.7599999999998s)]
*  There's your one chance to talk to me. Idiot total idiot. This girl. I've talked to the guy [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2845.52s)]
*  Mike dot Wade who's tagged. Guess what? He wasn't even fucking there. I had this kid basically in [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2852.24s)]
*  tears turning state witness to me rolling on the people there. I've talked to one of the two guys [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2858.4s)]
*  who fucking did it. He's like, I'm not anti-Semite. He's basically crying to me. And I'm just like, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2864.24s)]
*  I don't fucking buy it for a second. Who the fuck would do that sign in my fucking bar? You think [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2870.0s)]
*  I'm just gonna sit here? I'm gonna make it my fucking mission to put you in lights. My fucking [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2877.44s)]
*  mission. Kids crying. I just hung up on his ass. I go, I'm giving you one fucking hour, one fucking [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2883.6s)]
*  hour. Two kids go to temple. Tell me how do I make this fucking right? Before I go fucking eight [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2890.64s)]
*  shit. You want to take anti-Semitism classes? You want to do whatever? You make it feel right. I don't [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2898.08s)]
*  need your fucking tears. The Mike Wade kid wasn't even fucking there. Wasn't in the bar. We got the [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2904.08s)]
*  footage. Not even fucking bar. Trust me, they're pulling the footage. They're doing this. I'm 20 [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2911.36s)]
*  steps ahead. I'm using everything. I'm like, I am going to come for your fucking throat unless you [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2915.36s)]
*  give me answers. The two girls at the bar, idiots. This one girl, one of the waitresses. I just told [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2920.08s)]
*  her that you're the dumbest motherfucker I've ever talked to. 25 years old going on. Fucking two, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2926.56s)]
*  you fucking dumb fuck. What I'm saying is I'm getting the news. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2931.68s)]
*  So let's just pause it for a second here. Okay. I mean, that's it. You can cut that video off. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2936.56s)]
*  That's basically it. But it's like, dude, isn't talking to a 25 year old girl like that kind of [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2941.2s)]
*  fucked up who works for you. None of that. Right. He's saying this is a waitress at his bar. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2948.2400000000002s)]
*  You're like, I don't know, dude. Like, isn't the spirit of, I would think like the spirit of why [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2954.2400000000002s)]
*  you would be against holding up a fuck the Jews sign is because you'd go like, Hey, don't be dicks [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2961.44s)]
*  to people, man. You know what I mean? And I don't know if you really drive that message home being [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2966.32s)]
*  like, so I cursed out a 25 year old waitress who works for me. Like, all right. Just seems a little [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2971.76s)]
*  bit of an overreaction. I have feel like I'm eight years old being pulled into the principal's office [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2978.6400000000003s)]
*  laying on the Jewish guilt trip. But then I have kind of like the boss energy of this is my fucking [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2983.36s)]
*  bar, mafioso. Listen, honey. What the fuck did you do calling finding the 24 year old who was in the [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2988.32s)]
*  park and getting him to cry in the phone? It's kind of fun. It is kind of funny. I will admit that. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=2994.4s)]
*  I grant you that. But it's also kind of like, I don't know, dude, like it just, I don't know. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3000.5600000000004s)]
*  It just sounds like you're bullying all of these people now. And like, what did the waitress exactly [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3004.5600000000004s)]
*  do? That was the fuck up. I guess it was on her to say like, Oh, you can't have that sign here or [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3008.48s)]
*  something like that. But yeah, she's probably some young dingbat chick who is just like, I don't know. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3012.56s)]
*  They had a sign. I was, they were tipping well. So like, you know, like, I don't know. Anyway, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3017.2s)]
*  let's go to the second video because this actually gets funnier to me and just more ridiculous, but [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3022.56s)]
*  let's go to the other video because this is, so that's the first video he made. Then there's an [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3027.36s)]
*  update. By the way, I've lost track. I think there's like seven more update videos, but let's go to [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3031.6s)]
*  the next one. Cause this was particularly funny to me. Can you pull the video of the actual incident? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3036.16s)]
*  You have it. Oh yeah. That's probably a good idea. Yeah. Let's get here. Let's let's, I mean, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3040.4s)]
*  you can play this first and see if you can track it down. Let's do this and then see. So she has [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3047.6800000000003s)]
*  some time. Let's see if we could find the video of the incident. But I really think all I saw, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3050.96s)]
*  I just saw a still picture and it's just someone holding up a fuck the Jews sign. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3054.7200000000003s)]
*  All right. Real quick update on the fuck the Jews sign. That was at my bar in Philadelphia [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3060.32s)]
*  yesterday. Two hours ago, they literally could have cooked an egg on my head. That's how much [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3067.52s)]
*  steam and heat I had come out of my ears. And the more I thought about it, it's like, these are young [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3073.36s)]
*  fucking morons who did this. They're drunk. It's like, do you really want to ruin somebody's life? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3079.04s)]
*  And let me be honest, I don't know what's going on in the world. Well, I do the middle East, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3084.24s)]
*  obviously, but I've been doing barstool for 20 years. I've had more hate, more anti-Semitism [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3089.7599999999998s)]
*  in the last year, year and a half than I've ever had doing it. And whether people like Kanye, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3094.48s)]
*  the UFC guy is like mainstream lunatics. And I'm not talking about politics or what's going on in [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3099.28s)]
*  the Middle East, just hating groups of people. You hate my parents, you hate my grandparents, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3105.36s)]
*  shit like that. It's crazy. So yeah, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3110.48s)]
*  Yeah, let's pause it already there for a second. It really is right. Look, man, it's just like, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3114.32s)]
*  you even say it there yourself without really thinking about it. But it's like, yeah, I've never [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3122.64s)]
*  seen it like the way it's been the last year, the last 18 months. Like, yeah, that's kind of the [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3129.68s)]
*  thing. Right. And this has been like one of my messages that I've really been trying to get out [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3136.4s)]
*  there for the people who are very concerned about the rise in Jew hatred is that it's like, yeah, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3143.8399999999997s)]
*  dude, like, maybe it is the case that this policy is going to come with this blowback. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3150.48s)]
*  And that is not the same thing as justifying the blowback or excusing it. I think people are [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3158.96s)]
*  responsible for their actions and like, it's a fucked up thing to do to go bring this sign to a [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3166.56s)]
*  bar. Now, I will also say it's an insane thing to even consider the possibility of should I [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3172.56s)]
*  ruin a young person's life for this crime? I mean, that is fucking insane. Like the fact that [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3180.24s)]
*  Portnoy even has to go, I was thinking I should ruin their lives, but now I'm going in a different [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3185.68s)]
*  direction is like, yo, that's a crazy, I don't know. That's also, I think my mentality, Rob, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3190.56s)]
*  like I'm just old school. Like I could understand, I could understand going, I'm going to punch this [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3194.9599999999996s)]
*  kid in the mouth for doing this. I cannot understand going, I'm going to ruin this person's life. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3200.9599999999996s)]
*  Like that, that to me is just too nutty. In the same way I remember this, I don't know what you [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3207.12s)]
*  weren't there for this, Rob, but it was a thing a year ago. I almost got in a, I came very close [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3214.3199999999997s)]
*  to getting into a fist fight with the guy who was running the open mic after the Legion of Skanks. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3218.56s)]
*  It was at the old Creek in the cave in Long Island city. And I, Ooh, I really almost fucked this kid [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3226.0s)]
*  up. But like we got very close to being and getting into a fight and he was in the wrong [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3230.88s)]
*  and he was talking shit. And then he just kind of backed down and didn't want to fight. And I was [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3237.28s)]
*  furious. And then I go to the bar and I was having a drink at the bar and Rebecca, who is the owner [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3240.56s)]
*  of the club, she used to live above the club. So she comes down cause she had heard about this, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3245.6s)]
*  I guess. And she comes over to me and she goes, and just to be clear here, I really wanted to fight [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3251.52s)]
*  this kid who was not willing to fight me after he was talking shit. I was like, I was white, hot, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3257.28s)]
*  angry. This is maybe a half hour later, but I was furious at the kid. And then she comes down [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3262.7200000000003s)]
*  and she goes, she goes, Hey, I heard what happened. Like, what's the problem here? Do you need me to [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3268.0s)]
*  get rid of this guy? And you know, like I, you know, not that I have the most pull all throughout [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3271.52s)]
*  the world, but at the Creek in the cave, I could have said the word and gotten this kid banned from [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3277.1200000000003s)]
*  the club. And I remember immediately just going, no, no, there's no problem with that. Everything's [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3281.0400000000004s)]
*  fine. Cause like in my mind, it was always like, look, either we're going to fight or we're not, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3286.0s)]
*  but I'm not like, I'm not doing that. I'm not trying to like tell on you so that your like [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3290.24s)]
*  livelihood is hurt. Um, in some way that's just seems wrong. And so anyway, I think that [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3295.84s)]
*  reaction is crazy, but look in the same way that I think it's like fairly easy to recognize that [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3300.48s)]
*  like, if we're going to have this policy of say bombing Muslim countries, and this involves killing [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3307.12s)]
*  a lot of innocent people, then we are going to deal with a bunch of Muslims who want to kill us. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3314.96s)]
*  Like that's one of the things that comes along with that policy that doesn't justify [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3320.8s)]
*  terrorism. That doesn't mean Osama bin Laden was the good guy, but it does mean it's an [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3325.28s)]
*  understandable, predictable consequence of killing a lot of innocent people is that the people who [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3329.84s)]
*  were close to them are going to be ready to kill you. And in the same sense, you just go, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3336.2400000000002s)]
*  if you see this rise in antisemitism over the last year to 18 months, it is quite reasonable to say [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3341.04s)]
*  that maybe this is a result of a policy. Otherwise, why has it been riser? Is it a [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3347.52s)]
*  pure coincidence that it's been rising as we are backing Israel's destruction of Gaza? And then [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3354.88s)]
*  if you're really considered concerned about the rise of Jew hatred, maybe think about what's going [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3361.36s)]
*  to happen if we get sucked into a war with Iran on behalf of Israel and what this country ends up [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3366.4s)]
*  looking like, or if we are to help the Israelis ethnically cleanse Gaza after this campaign is [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3371.44s)]
*  over, what that's going to do here. Do you think Jew hatred goes up or down as a result of that? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3378.0s)]
*  And anyway, this is just like that. I think that as I've been saying for a long time now, I think [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3384.48s)]
*  that if you want to see less people who hate Jews, which I certainly do, it may not be my [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3390.56s)]
*  number one priority. I think there are other outrages that rise above someone holding a sign [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3398.7999999999997s)]
*  at a bar. But if you want to see less of that, you can't just be like, you can't give into the [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3404.24s)]
*  outrage that they are trying to generate. And you got to think about what policies we have that are [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3412.08s)]
*  leading to this. I don't know. To me, that all seems reasonable. What I don't know. I'm curious [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3418.56s)]
*  your thoughts, Rob. I want to see the end of this clip. All right here. Let's play the end. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3423.2s)]
*  It sounds like a walk back. Started off with don't fall. Well, I'll watch it though. I'll let it [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3427.92s)]
*  slide. I'm going to fucking burn these people to the ground. Their families, everything. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3433.44s)]
*  And it's like, you know what? Maybe that's not the best course of action. Maybe I can use this as a [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3440.72s)]
*  teaching moment. And like before people just are like, fuck the Jews or any group and the hate. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3446.24s)]
*  Let's try to like turn a hideous incident into maybe a learning experience as cliche and very [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3452.64s)]
*  unlike me. But I talked to both the culprits who I know are super involved in it. Talk to the families. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3459.2s)]
*  I'm sending these kids to Auschwitz. They've agreed to go. That's of course the Holocaust [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3467.4399999999996s)]
*  concentration camp. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3472.56s)]
*  It's too much to bear. Rob. It's too much to bear. First of all, can I just say like, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3480.96s)]
*  it started off like Sesame street. I'm going to teach them a lesson. First of all, I will say, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3488.4s)]
*  like, I understand clearly. I just want to make it clear for any people out there that [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3496.56s)]
*  Dave Portnoy is talking about the museum that is currently at Auschwitz, but there is something [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3503.28s)]
*  about I'm going to send them to Auschwitz. That's still rings. Very Nazi like to me to be like, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3507.76s)]
*  that's the appropriate punishment. I'm going to send them to Auschwitz. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3513.92s)]
*  If you just told me I had to go touch the floor of Germany and come back, even that's punishment. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3520.4s)]
*  But I go all the way to Germany and visit the site of horrible humanity. That's so brutal. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3525.2s)]
*  Also, you can't even get through it by cracking jokes, which I personally, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3534.16s)]
*  there was once a school trip that was doing, I was like, I can't go. I'll just be cracking [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3538.0s)]
*  jokes all the time. This is not for me. I'm not mature enough, nor do I want to process any. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3542.3999999999996s)]
*  And they were one of the rabbis or even why I go visit God's devastation. But that's just such a, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3548.08s)]
*  like that's almost the worst part is having to go and be respectful the whole time. If you're some [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3553.2s)]
*  dick bag kid from Philadelphia, who showed up to a bar with the fuck the Jews sign. And now you got [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3557.7599999999998s)]
*  to go and spend four days pretending to be respect. I wonder if Portnoy goes with them also and [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3563.6s)]
*  chaperones it. Dude. Well, so here's the funny thing, right? You could end this video. We don't [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3568.72s)]
*  have to play any more of it. But so this is the funniest thing too, is that I don't know where [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3573.3599999999997s)]
*  the saga is at now, but the next video after this, like his third emergency press conference [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3577.6s)]
*  is that they've gone dark on him. Like they just stopped responding after he was like, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3584.16s)]
*  you have to go to Auschwitz. So they're like, you know, they're just like go to fucking Auschwitz. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3589.2s)]
*  What are you talking about, dude? It's a funny thing of wealthy people, doling out punishments [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3593.2s)]
*  where it's like your parents would give you a timeout, but a guy who can send you on a ticket [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3597.8399999999997s)]
*  mandate that you go take a tour of Auschwitz. Let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3603.7599999999998s)]
*  today's show, which is Monetary Metals. I've been telling you about this company for a while. I love [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3608.4s)]
*  these guys. And as you may know, gold prices have been breaking all time highs in 2024. And now you [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3613.36s)]
*  can get your gold to work for you, generating interest income every month paid in additional [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3619.6s)]
*  ounces of physical gold. You can earn up to 5% on your gold and silver in their lease offerings. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3625.36s)]
*  And accredited investors can earn double digit returns in their bond offerings. Again, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3630.72s)]
*  all of the interest is paid in ounces, which are stored for free on your behalf. So if you're tired [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3636.08s)]
*  of your gold and silver collecting dust at home, or worse, racking up fees, having your metal [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3642.16s)]
*  professionally stored, check out monetary dash metals.com to learn how you can start putting [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3647.04s)]
*  your metal to work today. All right, let's get back into the show. But listen, aside from just [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3652.9599999999996s)]
*  being hilarious, like guys, this is all wrong. This is just not the way first off, don't go into [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3658.4s)]
*  this woke bullshit about how this is a teachable moment. And you've got to go essentially you're [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3665.6800000000003s)]
*  saying you got to go take Jewish HR classes or some sensitivity training or something like that. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3671.04s)]
*  This is not how, how much do we need to run this experiment? This does not work. It's also just, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3677.2000000000003s)]
*  it's just stupid. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3683.52s)]
*  Kids go over there and there's such anti semi surrealized, oh, there's actually an efficient [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3685.2s)]
*  system to get rid of them. You go my god, I thought the best we could do was hold up signs at bars. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3688.96s)]
*  But no, we could set up a whole apparatus here. Yeah, there's hope. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3694.24s)]
*  The people who bring a fuck the Jews sign to a bar don't need to be taught that that was insensitive. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3698.8s)]
*  They're aware. And nobody also nobody hasn't heard of the Holocaust. Like there's not it's [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3708.56s)]
*  not an issue of educating people about this. And this is just, I mean, look, all I'm saying is like, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3714.08s)]
*  if you want to see this stuff persist, and you want to see more of it, you this is the way to [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3719.84s)]
*  deal with it. Okay, I hope he does a daily press conference of 102 days since these people did not [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3725.44s)]
*  report to us. Dude, it is hilarious. It is hilarious that that's the direction he went and [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3731.2s)]
*  said I'm sending you to Auschwitz. Look, man, like, I'll just say, and this is the old look, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3737.76s)]
*  I'm not saying like, this is the exact perfect model or anything like that. But you know, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3744.4s)]
*  there was that that Darrell Davis guy, and his he was this black dude. And he was famous for [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3750.6400000000003s)]
*  converting people out of the Ku Klux Klan. And he would, like, he he would collect their, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3756.5600000000004s)]
*  their hoods, and like, keep their hoods, I forget how many he's got, but he's got like 20 hoods or [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3765.2s)]
*  something like that of like all these guys who used to be in the clown, who he convinced out of [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3770.48s)]
*  it, you know, the way he would do it is he would have dinner with them. And he wouldn't even talk [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3774.7999999999997s)]
*  about the fucking clown. And he wouldn't even pre he wouldn't get it. He wasn't angry at him. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3781.3599999999997s)]
*  He wouldn't preach them. They wouldn't talk politics, nothing like that. They just break bread [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3785.52s)]
*  and have some dinner like he would just be cool. And then because he was being cool, and he was [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3790.0s)]
*  black, eventually they kind of started going like, ah, shit, you know, and then like, I think as he [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3795.44s)]
*  built a rapport with them, he would just kind of let them know, like how much that hurt him. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3802.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? It was like, it's like really hurtful to me that you be a part of this [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3806.72s)]
*  organization and then let them do all I'm saying. I'm not saying that's the perfect dynamic. I'm [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3810.56s)]
*  just saying this is this ain't it. This ain't it. You're not forcing forcing under duress clearly [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3815.04s)]
*  here, right? Like he's not like, he's not like, hey, I'd really like to educate you about this. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3820.96s)]
*  And I'd like to bring you here to Auschwitz. It's like, hey, I could either ruin your fucking life [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex89cSGdKE4&t=3824.4s)]
