# Dave Smith  The Rise of Antisemitism  Part Of The Problem 1208
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys)
*  What's up, what's up everybody welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem I am Dave Smith [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=0.0s)]
*  He is Robbie the fire Bernstein joining us from Austin, Texas. How are you sir? How's Texas treating you dude? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=11.6s)]
*  I love being down in Austin. I had a great porch guard in San Antonio, but then I got to hang out at the creek in the cave [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=18.36s)]
*  I got to watch Lewis's show. I got to do that. Oh great. I forgot [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  You guys are both out there at the same time that works out [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=27.36s)]
*  It feels old-school when you can actually go to like clubs and hang out and be around Lewis and BK Chris [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=29.72s)]
*  It's like, you know other than skank fest. I don't get that that often these days [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=35.14s)]
*  Yeah, there's a dude Austin is there they're doing a really good job down there. They're building [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=39.08s)]
*  Quite a comedy scene. I can't point to one particular factor that made it so much better, but it's uh, yeah [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=45.56s)]
*  I know it's uh, it's great down there. It is Austin is constantly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Every time I go to Austin it almost feels like [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=56.14s)]
*  Like I have to look deep at Austin in the eyes and be like, are you you're trying to steal me, aren't you? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=60.5s)]
*  You're trying to get me to move my family down here. I know you are Austin [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=65.7s)]
*  I know what you're doing and it's Austin's a seductress [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=69.26s)]
*  All right. Well, merry merry Christmas. Happy almost Hanukkah. I think when does Hanukkah start Rob? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=74.34s)]
*  Hmm. I don't know. I should know but I don't know [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=81.38s)]
*  Wow [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=84.41999999999999s)]
*  Some Jew you are there [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=85.82s)]
*  Rob some is it not no, I don't know anyway. Oh, yeah, I think it's this week. I think it's right around [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=88.05999999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Okay. It's the day after Christmas [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=94.02s)]
*  I have to make sure is a Merry Christmas and how happy Hanukkah to open today's show because this is how I get this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  My part of my guy now [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=102.17999999999999s)]
*  And also by the way, you know what? Let's not miss them either Kwanzaa, too [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  That's gonna be the rest of the show Natalie pull me up a list of holidays [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=108.94s)]
*  I'm gonna wish everybody happy their holiday and then we can get out of here [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=111.8s)]
*  so I did you know, I was kind of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  internally debating [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  Whether or not to talk about this on the show a little bit today [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  Partially because I kind of feel like this is something we've already covered and I've already [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=126.12s)]
*  Kind of expressed how I feel about this stuff [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=135.76s)]
*  But yet no matter how many times you do that the question keeps coming up, you know, I had um, I [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=138.2s)]
*  Had an interesting interaction with Mike Cernovich on Twitter a few days ago [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=145.33999999999997s)]
*  Who Mike Cernovich for people that they don't know he's a very very popular Twitter [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  As I should say he has a lot of followers on Twitter. He's got I think over a million [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=158.6s)]
*  Followers on there and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=164.55999999999997s)]
*  He's written books and been on a lot of podcasts over the years. I met him way back in the day [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  right before he really blew up and got famous on a Fox News show and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=171.72s)]
*  He's a very he's a very interesting guy and he has [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=176.11999999999998s)]
*  He'll have very poignant observations at times and this was one that I thought was was really interesting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  but so now Mike Cernovich and I don't want to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=186.11999999999998s)]
*  Get wrong what his views are but I certainly I think that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=189.24s)]
*  Certainly me and him disagree on Israel. I think that's safe to say he does not have like my the same perspective as me on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=194.0s)]
*  On the Israel-Palestine conflict or US support for for Israel or again? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=202.2s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what his opinion is, but it certainly there's lots of disagreement between us, but he did [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  Totally side with me on the woke right debate between me and James Lindsay [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  Because he was just like oh, yeah, obviously listen. He goes. I don't even agree with you on Israel, but let's get real [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=218.92s)]
*  That's the thing that'll get you cancelled. That's the thing that you like it's just so obvious [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=224.44s)]
*  That he was like, yeah, of course, obviously like within conservatism, Inc [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=230.64s)]
*  You're not allowed to be anti-israel and they will come at you in a hysterical woke way if you are so [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=234.56s)]
*  He's at least like yeah, that's bullshit. You shouldn't that shouldn't be the scenario and one of the things [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=240.76s)]
*  So this was um [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=246.16s)]
*  Maybe this was a couple weeks ago or something like that, but somebody on Twitter was asking me to denounce [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=248.16s)]
*  anti-Semitism and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=254.48s)]
*  I [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=257.24s)]
*  You know like in some way I was like, yeah, I've said this a million times before I don't like Jew hatred by the way [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=258.28s)]
*  I'm Jewish. Obviously, I don't like Jew hatred like what and then Cernovich responded [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=263.8s)]
*  I don't remember exactly what he said, but I thought there was a lot of wisdom to it as he goes [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=269.44s)]
*  Look Dave, this is the proof really that they are the woke is that this is the whole game [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=272.96s)]
*  They demand you denounce something and it doesn't matter how many times you denounce it [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=278.96s)]
*  They're gonna demand again that you denounce it and they'll pretend as if you never have [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=283.52s)]
*  Denounced it before and then the the game is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=289.04s)]
*  That they constantly keep you on your knees [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=293.04s)]
*  They constantly keep you having to sit here and you can you can never make the point that you want to make without [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  Sandwiching it between two pieces of I'm not a terrible person bread [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=301.2s)]
*  And and when you're doing that you're already kind of losing like there's it's a different game than like [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=306.4s)]
*  You know the way Donald Trump plays the alpha game that me and you would never think of but he does it constantly [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=312.88s)]
*  Every time he shakes your hand. He's pulling you off balance every time you walk [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  He's making sure he walks a step in front of you like there there are all of these other energies [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=322.56s)]
*  Aside from logic and rational arguments that that probably are much more important than logic and rational arguments [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=327.92s)]
*  In terms of how people communicate and if they can get you to constantly be denounced [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  This is why every single time there's an israel palestine panel or anything like that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=340.56s)]
*  The first questions are always does israel have a right to exist? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=345.6s)]
*  The first questions are always does israel have a right to exist do you denounce himos? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=349.12s)]
*  Do you denounce terrorism and then no matter where the conversation goes from there? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=354.24s)]
*  They've started with you on your knees. You know what I mean being like yes. Yes. Yes [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm against all these things or they've started with you refusing to denounce those things in which case they can go. Hmm [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=364.0s)]
*  Well, look at that. This guy won't even say he hates himos or something like that. So [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  typically speaking [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=376.56s)]
*  This is why I was having a little bit of a battle is that I just try to not even play these games [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=378.8s)]
*  I'm not even getting into this. I've already everybody who listens to me already knows how I feel about these things [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=384.88s)]
*  I don't need to constantly be denouncing them, especially when there's much more important things [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=390.56s)]
*  Going on does is does that make sense? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=395.2s)]
*  I I know it makes sense to you rob because we've talked about this before but anyway, that's kind of how I generally tend to feel [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=397.36s)]
*  Anything you want to add feel free rob and then i'll get it. Yeah, I feel like we're not the view [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=403.84s)]
*  We don't have a legal department handing us paperwork that we have to make a new public announcement [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=407.68s)]
*  We're giving people our best insights on the news. We tend to be right. We're also comedians with jokes and uh, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=412.0s)]
*  I think it's silly that we have to respond to twitter accusations at the top of the show [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=417.84s)]
*  To go. Hey, we got a legal disclaimer here to re-notify you that we're not anti-semites or I mean that it seems a little [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=423.84s)]
*  The whole structure sounds a little silly 100% so here's why i'm even talking about this at all [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=431.68s)]
*  um [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=438.4s)]
*  is that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=439.36s)]
*  There and and listen like I said before, um, you know, it's i'm not going to keep saying this over and over again [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=441.04s)]
*  So if you guys want you guys who are the tech savvy people clip this [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=446.24s)]
*  And then this can be the thing that you send to people when they ask me to denounce whatever and this will be my you know [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=449.52s)]
*  What I mean like my close allegiance and holder on our circumcised penises in front of the camera to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=454.96s)]
*  our uh, Jewish faith [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=461.12s)]
*  It's not gonna hurt rob. It's not so i'm just saying it's worst case scenario. We're right back to where we are now [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  um, no, but so what essentially what happened was I was to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=469.76s)]
*  I thought natalie by the way had the best organic reaction to this one before we started the show [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=473.68s)]
*  I was like, oh i'm gonna i'll address this controversy of people being mad at me because jake shields posted a meme [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=478.48s)]
*  And she goes mad at you [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=485.2s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, no it that's right it is ridiculous that but anyway [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=487.2s)]
*  so [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=492.32s)]
*  uh what happened was jake shields, um, whose show i've [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  Just did um, well, I guess it was back at skank fest. So it was back, uh this fall early fall [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=498.24s)]
*  Um, so a few months ago, um, uh, I did his show. So he posted [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=503.52s)]
*  um a meme that was very offensive to a lot of people [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=508.56s)]
*  um, and uh, and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=513.12s)]
*  you know [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=515.52s)]
*  Certainly insensitive to jewish people let's say leave it at that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=516.64s)]
*  It was a meme of a jew kind of like eating uncle sam's intestines or something like that. It's pretty graphic [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=520.64s)]
*  And um for the record, I don't think kosher but that's that's the real outrage if you if you ask me [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=527.12s)]
*  Um, although I don't know there could have been a rabbi who blessed uncle sam. I'm not sure I don't [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  You probably know this better than me rob [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=539.04s)]
*  but [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=541.52s)]
*  Then there was a call of a bunch of a bunch of people I was getting swarmed on twitter to denounce jake shields [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=543.28s)]
*  For posting this meme, uh, which is anybody who knows me knows I refuse to do because I just don't first off [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't throw people who i'm friends or friendly with under the bus. I don't denounce people on command [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=557.12s)]
*  That's just not I don't play that game [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=564.0s)]
*  the only reason why i'm even addressing this [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=566.4s)]
*  is because after [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  A few interactions with people who are like you must denounce jake shields and i'm like what you're saying [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=571.6s)]
*  What someone I did a show with posted a meme you don't like and therefore I must jump now fuck you [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  You know in my kind of typical fashion [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=583.12s)]
*  but then there were several people who [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=586.1600000000001s)]
*  Were like following me [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=590.1600000000001s)]
*  On social media. I don't know how you know if they're fans or not [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  But they're following me on social media who were like hey dave [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=595.44s)]
*  I love so much of why what you have to say, but come on man. Can't you just call this out? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=598.64s)]
*  I mean, this is pretty gross and wrong and so, you know what? I mean there there were enough people like that [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=602.8s)]
*  That it kind of did make me think, you know [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=608.64s)]
*  Okay [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  Look if you're if there's somebody who's like supports what israel's doing to palestine right now [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=611.04s)]
*  And then they're just trying to get me on this outrage. It's like fuck you dude, you know [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=616.56s)]
*  But if there is somebody who's not that who's going well, wait a minute. This is a little weird [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean don't you want to separate yourself from that or don't you don't you not agree with this? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=626.0s)]
*  Like why why can't you just give it to us straight and say how you feel there was enough of that that I was like, all right [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=630.4s)]
*  Maybe I should at least address this a little bit [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=637.92s)]
*  And so here's what i'm gonna say and this is me and you have talked about this before rob [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=640.96s)]
*  I'm sure we'll be forced into talking about this at some point in the future [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=645.52s)]
*  But for now let this be the thing if you want to clip this and post it [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=648.48s)]
*  Here's here's my opinion when it comes to all of this stuff [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=652.64s)]
*  first of all [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=656.48s)]
*  I think that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=658.24s)]
*  the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=659.76s)]
*  The way that people view [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=660.72s)]
*  Racism or and bigotry and prejudice and all of these things is [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=664.22s)]
*  somewhat [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=671.66s)]
*  twisted [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=674.56s)]
*  Not healthy [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=675.68s)]
*  And and of course this is in large part because this has been for many many years the the cardinal sin of [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=678.0s)]
*  the dominant progressive culture [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=686.0s)]
*  searching for racism or sexism or transphobia or homophobia or in this case [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=689.8399999999999s)]
*  Antisemitism, um, which again a lot of these words. I just hate I don't like it [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=696.4599999999999s)]
*  Antisemitism to me is like homophobia. It's just a really bad word. It doesn't even mean [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=701.66s)]
*  What it's supposed to mean what you mean is jew hater [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=707.28s)]
*  but semitic people are not just jewish and then it's so it just [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=710.8s)]
*  particularly when all of the people involved in this conflict or at least all of the palestinians are or most of them are semitic and [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=715.42s)]
*  Then a lot of the israelis are debatably semit whatever. It's just it's not a good term to me, but [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=722.48s)]
*  As i've said for many many years. I just think that there's there's a huge kind of problem with [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=729.76s)]
*  Prioritization of outrage when it comes to these type of issues the example I always [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=735.42s)]
*  Gave was that you know barack obama or donald trump or joe biden or someone like that could literally drone bomb a wedding [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=741.04s)]
*  And kill, you know six children and if the same day they said that [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=748.56s)]
*  You know, um, if you're born a man, you're a man [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=755.76s)]
*  And there's no such thing as transgenderism or something like that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=759.52s)]
*  We all know what the outrage of the day would be the outrage of the day would be that they said something offensive to trans [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=763.2s)]
*  people and the fact that six kids got killed at a wedding in yemen would be like [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=769.12s)]
*  27th on the list if it's on the list at all and I find that to be um [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=773.98s)]
*  Sick and perverse and backward and insane like it's not this isn't a libertarian or a left right question [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=779.2s)]
*  It's like if you are at all a sane human being you'd go that that's just like [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=786.64s)]
*  What type of monster upside down world are you living in? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=792.32s)]
*  Where the slaughter of children is not more outrageous than like someone having an offensive view that may or may not be right [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  um anyway [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=804.64s)]
*  When it comes specifically to you know, look me and me and rob are both, uh [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=808.0s)]
*  Jews we're not like currently practicing religious jews, but you know, we're we're both jewish in the way that [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=813.44s)]
*  Everybody means it [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=819.92s)]
*  Including the pro-israel side whenever they talk about you know what I mean [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=821.92s)]
*  Like it's not it's not as if if if there were some like a terrorist attack on atheist jews that ben chapiro [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=824.8000000000001s)]
*  And and you know, uh netanyahu would all be like oh this wasn't an attack on jews [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=832.64s)]
*  You only become not a jew when you're criticizing israel and then they go are you even a jew really? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=838.32s)]
*  Anyway, that's for another day [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=843.04s)]
*  um [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=845.76s)]
*  But as two people who are jews who have been very critical of israel over the year. It's uh, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=847.6s)]
*  It's an interesting spot to be in [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  That's i've compared it before to being like kind of similar to being a black conservative or something like that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=854.64s)]
*  Who's critical of black lives matter? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=859.36s)]
*  um, there's a kind of [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=861.6800000000001s)]
*  You know in some ways you're protected because it's a little bit harder to smear you [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=864.32s)]
*  um, but in some ways [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=869.6s)]
*  You know your identity is weaponized and it's kind of vicious the way they they come at you. Um [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=872.24s)]
*  But whatever not the end of the world [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=877.84s)]
*  But i've always kind of thought that [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=881.28s)]
*  I have [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=883.84s)]
*  I have the attitude that I think a lot of conservatives pretend to have when they're talking about every other group [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=885.2s)]
*  so [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=893.44s)]
*  You know like i've i've used this example before in fact [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=894.32s)]
*  I think recently I said this that you know ben chapiro has this famous clip of when he was much younger and he's on the stage [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=896.48s)]
*  with uh, like three, um [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=903.36s)]
*  Like progressive black professors [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=906.72s)]
*  And he he gives them all a dose of bitter medicine [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=909.52s)]
*  He looks right at him and he goes. Hey, you know, you guys are complaining about systemic racism this and that [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=912.88s)]
*  Let me tell you something black people are 13 of the population and they make up 50 of the homicides [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=917.6800000000001s)]
*  The black illegitimacy rate is over 70 percent. The black illiteracy rate is this the black this is just taking the gloves off [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=922.96s)]
*  This is what's wrong in the black community and it's not white people's fault [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=929.2s)]
*  This is your own community and you need to police that right? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=933.12s)]
*  But if anyone ever took the gloves off with jewish people the way he does with black people [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=936.16s)]
*  He would immediately turn into that pink haired 20 year old feminist chick and just start shrieking anti-semitism [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=941.04s)]
*  I mean ben chapiro may not have the same [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=947.28s)]
*  You know views that me and you have with like say the military industrial complex or the banking sector or something like that [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  But certainly at least if you're talking about like the corporate media and academia [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=957.6s)]
*  He's been railing against those things forever. There are there is a dis-prepare a disproportionate amount of jewish people involved in those institutions [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=961.22s)]
*  Like a wildly disproportionate amount, but if anyone ever just started blaming jews based on that [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=968.34s)]
*  He would he would flip out and say you're an anti-semite [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=974.34s)]
*  And but by the way, it's very similar logic to the blacks are 13 percent of the population [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=977.94s)]
*  But 50 something percent of the crime it's like okay, but that doesn't have like i'm an individualist on these things across the board [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=982.82s)]
*  I don't i'm like, okay. Yeah, that might be true of there might be black people [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=989.62s)]
*  But that is not that's not a reflection on some black guy who has nothing to do with that [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=993.78s)]
*  And I feel the same way about jews. I'm I don't judge people in as collectives in this way [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=997.78s)]

*  um [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1091.82s)]
*  At least I try not to not to an unreasonable extent [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1093.18s)]
*  anyway [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1097.18s)]
*  My attitude has always been as i've said many times on the show before that [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1098.62s)]
*  My grandfather grew up in a country nazi germany [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1103.4199999999998s)]
*  Or at least he the nazis rose during while he was young [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1107.4199999999998s)]
*  and [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1113.02s)]
*  That was a legitimately difficult place for a jewish person to be it was an anti-jew society in many ways [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1114.3799999999999s)]
*  and [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1122.3799999999999s)]
*  That's just not been my experience [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1123.4199999999998s)]
*  I grew up in a country where literally not once in my life has there been an obstacle toward my [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1125.5800000000002s)]
*  Happiness my success my achievements. There's never been an obstacle put in my way because i'm jewish [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1133.0s)]
*  And so I just think whining and crying and labeling people as anti-semite or you hate jews. I think it's like [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1138.7s)]
*  Very bad form. I don't think that jewish people should be complaining about how big it is [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1146.22s)]
*  Our society is because it's just not true [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1152.14s)]
*  It's not it's not the case that jews are some oppressed minority jews are a market dominant minority as amy chua [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1155.34s)]
*  Uh, I think coined the term or at least uses the term quite a bit jews are thriving in our society [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1163.98s)]
*  and so I I don't think this like this um [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1170.7s)]
*  whining [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1175.8s)]
*  About like because like what are you even talking about? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1176.94s)]
*  You know, i've i've always been able to it's very it's always been very easy for me, especially when [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1179.42s)]
*  Um criticizing woke progressives, which by the way [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1184.14s)]
*  None of these people who are coming at me ever have a problem with it when you're talking about the woke progressives [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1187.26s)]
*  But when you just sit there and you go like look man [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1191.98s)]
*  What are you even talking about here? Are you talking about like someone's feelings were hurt on a college campus? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1194.94s)]
*  Well, get over it who gives a shit [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1201.18s)]
*  Even if someone said something offensive. Okay, you heard something offensive. That's your plight [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1203.74s)]
*  If you want to tell me your plight is that your people are struggling and people don't have enough food to eat and people [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1208.46s)]
*  Can't get good education or good health care. Okay, let's have that conversation about what's causing that but you're telling me someone's feelings were hurt [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1213.02s)]
*  You're telling me someone [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1221.1s)]
*  Microaggressed against you on a college campus or someone posted a meme that you don't like this just isn't that important [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1222.86s)]
*  I don't care [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1230.7s)]
*  Okay, like it's just this doesn't rise to the level of being anything [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1232.22s)]
*  and so [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1236.06s)]
*  All you know all of that being said [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1237.74s)]
*  Obviously as anyone could deduce I don't like [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1241.24s)]
*  Like anti-jewish stuff. I think it's wrong and it's ugly and it also [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1245.98s)]
*  It leads to people. Um [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1253.02s)]
*  To people being sloppy and not understanding the world [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1256.22s)]
*  I I think that the people who get like poison their own mind and get obsessed with jew hatred [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1259.9s)]
*  They end up being wrong like they just don't get it right. So yeah, I don't like any of that stuff [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1266.22s)]
*  um, that being said [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1273.02s)]
*  I also [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1275.6599999999999s)]
*  You know it it just isn't at the top of my list of outrages [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1278.9399999999998s)]
*  I guess that's really what it is and I don't think that I think that um [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1283.34s)]
*  As as a jewish person or whatever [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1288.86s)]
*  I don't think the correct response to that is just is to become a hysterical leftist and start going [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1291.02s)]
*  Oh, woe is me. It's so horrible. Let me denounce this and you're an anti-semite and you're an anti-semite [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1295.9799999999998s)]
*  I think all of that is kind of stupid and doesn't help. I'd rather just be me [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1301.34s)]
*  I I treat people with decency if they treat me with decency and I think that's kind of the best antidote [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1306.86s)]
*  for a lot of this stuff, so it's not like that I um [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1313.34s)]
*  Um, I like I think is fairly obvious for anyone who watches our show [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1317.5s)]
*  If I liked that stuff, then we'd be doing it, but we don't that's not what we're about. Um that that all being said [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1322.62s)]
*  Just doesn't rank that high on my list of of outrages, but you know, i'll tell you [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1332.14s)]
*  Probably the thing that um, and maybe this is an admission of some sort [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1338.54s)]
*  But probably the thing that annoys me the most about it is that they they hurt us [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1342.7s)]
*  They make us look bad [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1346.7s)]
*  Everybody in my twitter replies who's saying some like I hate the jews stuff. You're not helping [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1348.46s)]
*  You're helping them a lot more than you're helping us [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1354.06s)]
*  It's only weakening like our argument and then it puts us through this headache of having to defend the dumb shit you say [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1356.86s)]
*  Or explain it away or something like that. So I don't like it. I don't like any of that stuff [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1363.82s)]
*  Um, I didn't like the meme that jake posted and like, you know [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1369.1799999999998s)]
*  But if i'm going to say that i'll say that to him [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1373.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't need to say that to somebody accusing me of something on twitter [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1375.5800000000002s)]
*  The truth is just taking the uh, the jake example itself [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1379.18s)]
*  jake shields is somebody who I was a huge fan of for many many years before I ever met him, uh jake shields for people [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1383.18s)]
*  Who don't know was a legit [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1389.74s)]
*  like [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1392.46s)]
*  elite level [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1393.5s)]
*  ufc mma fighter [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1395.24s)]
*  Uh, the dude beat dan henderson for the strike force title and went the distance with gsp [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1397.3400000000001s)]
*  Like he's not I also particularly loved his camp [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1402.22s)]
*  He was trained with nick diaz and nate diaz and all those guys gilbert melendez and them and then when I met him [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1405.0200000000002s)]
*  Like a few years ago. We hit it off and got along great. He's a really nice guy and we hung out together [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1411.1000000000001s)]
*  Then over the the last year [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1416.94s)]
*  um, he's definitely like [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1420.22s)]
*  Been focusing a lot on israel and jews in general. I don't agree with everything that he said [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1423.18s)]
*  Um, he asked me to come back on his show last time we were out in vegas. I was like absolutely brother would love to [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1430.3s)]
*  You know like I don't know and [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1436.22s)]
*  When we talked and as we have talked several times, um, he's like, yeah, I don't hate jewish people at all [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1438.62s)]
*  No [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1445.1s)]
*  Okay [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1445.98s)]
*  No, you can kind of judge. I don't [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1447.1799999999998s)]
*  Does that mean he? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1449.82s)]
*  That there's 100% he doesn't I don't know you could listen to him. He's got a platform too [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1452.06s)]
*  He can say what he wants to say I can say what I believe and that's that I still [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1456.7s)]
*  I I still will be nothing but exactly the same to jake going forward as I have been in the past [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1462.54s)]
*  I don't stop being friends with someone because they post a meme [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1468.78s)]
*  I don't like because that seems insane to me. Like I don't know. Is that great? That's just fucking insane. Um, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1472.14s)]
*  But then people go they'll just jump to these things. Well, can't you admit this guy's a neo nazi? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1478.8600000000001s)]
*  You're like, well, I mean I [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1484.3s)]
*  what [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1486.3s)]
*  What do you even mean by this? What is it? Oh, he's an anti-semite. He hates jews [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1487.82s)]
*  It's like listen a lot of times these things are not [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1491.98s)]
*  Black and white life is not simple [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1496.1399999999999s)]
*  I know that woke progressives like to make it into these neat little lines [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1498.78s)]
*  The bigots are over here and the anti-bigots are over here [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1503.02s)]
*  That's not how real life actually works [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1506.54s)]
*  The truth is that we all have certain prejudices [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1508.78s)]
*  We try to not let them get out of control or irrational [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1512.64s)]
*  Sometimes people do allow them to get irrational and out of control [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  I still don't think the best response to that is like denounce [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1521.2s)]
*  And disassociate and you and and call names. You're a bigot. You're this by the way [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1526.48s)]
*  And just to be clear here and i'll i'll wrap up in a sec [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1531.76s)]
*  I'm not at all. I'm not saying that i'm darrell davis or what I do is anything like that [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1534.8000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so just to be clear preface this is not what i'm saying, but if you know the famous story of darrell davis [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1540.6399999999999s)]
*  He was a black guy who used to go meet with clownsmen [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1546.48s)]
*  And he would collect their hoods like they'd voluntarily give them up, but he would like [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1550.24s)]
*  De-radicalize them essentially was the idea they convincing him not to be a bigot and in every every single time the way he did that [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1555.58s)]
*  Was he he would go? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1563.6s)]
*  Just have a conversation with them [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1565.9199999999998s)]
*  Not come in calling them bigots and racists and denouncing the clue clucks clan that was never how he started it [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1568.24s)]
*  He'd come over and say can we have a meal? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1574.5600000000002s)]
*  Can we talk together? Can we hang out a little bit and then just be their friends? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1577.28s)]
*  And that's what de-radicalize them ultimately now i'm not saying that's an apples to apples comparison to what i'm doing [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1582.0800000000002s)]
*  It's nothing like that [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1587.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm just making the point simply that if that was the goal, which that is not my goal [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1589.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm not going on jake shield's podcast or I don't go on on and have conversations with any of these guys like [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1594.8s)]
*  I'm gonna leave here with their clowns hood. I'm that's not my goal. I'm like i'm gonna tell the truth [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1600.56s)]
*  And as I see it in a compelling way i'm gonna do what I always do on these shows [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1606.48s)]
*  I'm just making the point that even if the goal [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1610.3999999999999s)]
*  Was to let's say you think jake shield's a jew hater and the goal would be what to deal with that [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1613.76s)]
*  Well, then I do think the best way to handle that would be for someone like me [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1620.56s)]
*  Who's a jew to just be a decent person to him? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1624.8799999999999s)]
*  I think that's the best way [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1627.52s)]
*  I actually think if when you're actually dealing with prejudice or people who don't like one group of people [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1628.8799999999999s)]
*  I think the best way to handle that if you're a member of that group is like just don't be the caricature of what they accuse you [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1634.6399999999999s)]
*  Of being to show them that you're something different and then that in itself demonstrates that like oh, you know what? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1641.6s)]
*  There are actually lots of jews who are just decent people who treat us with decency [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1648.16s)]
*  That to me seems to be a better way to deal with it. I'm sorry [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1652.88s)]
*  I've been ranting for a while rob you can get in and say whatever you want to but I did feel like this kind [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1655.44s)]
*  Of has to be addressed [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1659.76s)]
*  uh, I mean i'm okay with everything that you just said but uh [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1661.6000000000001s)]
*  I you know, i've experienced this a little bit. I really love working on jokes [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1665.8400000000001s)]
*  That's what i'm passionate about crafting jokes and a lot of my jokes, you know [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1669.28s)]
*  I have a bit of a commentary about freedom and being anti-government and that's really important to me [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1672.48s)]
*  And sometimes people come along with their social causes and they're all upset that my social cause [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1677.12s)]
*  That their social cause is not top of my radar [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1681.9199999999998s)]
*  and it's not the thing that i'm talking about or working on or or more passionate about and uh, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1685.04s)]
*  Like it's kind of like I remember louis once did a clean set like on tv [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1691.12s)]
*  And then someone got upset at him that he was a blue comic like when they came to his show and he's like [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1695.44s)]
*  That's what I do and like, you know, that's my brand. That's what i'm doing. We're over here. We're talking about [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1698.96s)]
*  That we like freedom and that government is evil and corrupt and proliferates evil [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1705.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, that's what we do. So we didn't get here by [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1711.44s)]
*  Constantly complaining about anti-semitism. That's not what you know what I mean [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1715.2800000000002s)]
*  I I feel like this is a game of other people with a more losing agenda because it's annoying being out in the world [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1718.5600000000002s)]
*  Just yelling about anti-semitism all the time that are, you know, just trying to force us to take on their stupidity [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1724.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I right I completely agree and i'm sorry [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1730.66s)]
*  But like you're the thing that you do is just dumber and weaker than the thing that we do [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1733.78s)]
*  All right [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1739.22s)]
*  We're focused on the things that matter that are important and the truth is also jake shiels is not an act like i'm not [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1739.46s)]
*  I don't listen to jake shiels show i'm familiar with mma. He's a cool guy. I think I shook his hand at a scanning fest [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1745.54s)]
*  He's not an academic [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1750.66s)]
*  uh [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1751.94s)]
*  The idea that he put out a meme like sometimes just twitter's a little bit like hanging out in high school and you [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1752.1000000000001s)]
*  Post some dumb shit up in your locker. It's not I don't know. This is not uh [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1756.58s)]
*  proof of anti-semitism and i'm not that concerned that uh [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1761.78s)]
*  Jews are so [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1765.22s)]
*  Unlikeable that if anyone's tearing us down a little bit and cracking jokes or putting up an evil meme that all of a sudden [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1766.5s)]
*  People are going to start rounding me up once again. Yeah. Yeah, well, that's right [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1771.9399999999998s)]
*  I think it's um, and it does really I mean [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1776.1s)]
*  I'm talking about like a one-to-one comparison the way it mirrors like what woke college kids would be saying [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1780.02s)]
*  Like where you just go [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1786.98s)]
*  Oh, so you were just a little bit offended and then they have to of course make this grant [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1787.7s)]
*  No, this language is tied to violence and this is what leads to violence and but I just got a ton of this [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1791.38s)]
*  No, this is another holocaust essentially, you know, that's that bad memes are a holocaust [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1799.54s)]
*  I mean, there's a couple steps in between but like they'll lead to them [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1805.06s)]
*  And if you don't call this out, you won't but i'm just saying even if [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1808.18s)]
*  The goal was to reduce anti-semitism if the goal was to reduce people who don't like [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1812.3400000000001s)]
*  Jews or people who are talking about Jews in a negative way [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1818.1000000000001s)]
*  like [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1822.02s)]
*  I don't know. Why has there been a rise of it over the last year? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1823.3s)]
*  Is that connected at all to what israel's doing? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1826.8200000000002s)]
*  And the fact that we have to fund it and the fact that you're not allowed to criticize it and the fact that all of [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1830.26s)]
*  our politicians are [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1835.94s)]
*  From both parties all of them are just constantly in a who can kiss israel's ass more competition [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1838.3400000000001s)]
*  Is that helping you think because from my perspective? I think that's pushing a lot more people toward not liking jews too much [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1846.02s)]
*  So I certainly don't think that this that you this is eradicating the the problem [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1852.9s)]
*  um [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1859.78s)]
*  Sorry, I just think people are playing into stupidity if you're getting worked up over a jake shield meme [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1860.5s)]
*  If that's what you need to sit around and have serious discourse about I don't know [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1866.1000000000001s)]
*  you're just being sucked into a world of uh, of stupid and you're platforming like things that don't [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1869.8600000000001s)]
*  Don't need this much conversation [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1876.66s)]
*  Look, I I agree and I also think that [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1879.46s)]
*  there's [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1882.98s)]
*  I have seen [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1884.1000000000001s)]
*  an enormous [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1885.94s)]
*  amount [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1887.7s)]
*  Like i'm not trying to downplay it like i've seen a lot of like anti-jewish stuff on twitter [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1889.14s)]
*  And it's definitely gone up over the last year. There's no question about that at least in my anecdotal experience [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1894.1000000000001s)]
*  And I think this is true in general [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1900.3400000000001s)]
*  um, but i've also [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1902.42s)]
*  seen just [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1904.5s)]
*  appalling levels of [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1905.92s)]
*  anti-palestinian [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1908.4s)]
*  You know views that are really I mean and i'm not talking about just um [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1910.3400000000001s)]
*  Uh memes i'm talking about like in debates that i've been in on this topic [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1916.26s)]
*  Whereas i'm certainly there's never of course because it's me [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1922.74s)]
*  there's never been a podcast or a debate or a show or anything that i've ever done where i'm just ranting about the [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1926.6599999999999s)]
*  Jews and how the jews don't have natural rights and you should be allowed to do whatever you want to the jews and that's [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1933.78s)]
*  like that's never been my [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1940.4199999999998s)]
*  position and I I don't [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1942.6599999999999s)]
*  Look, i'm not saying no one's ever done that but I don't I haven't heard anybody ever make the argument that [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1944.8999999999999s)]
*  Jews do not have rights [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1951.6200000000001s)]
*  Jews do not have rights this group of people has forfeited all of their rights because of the way they have acted [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1954.18s)]
*  Yet that is exactly what's been said to me in israel palestine debates [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1960.26s)]
*  in multiple debates that [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1965.3000000000002s)]
*  Exactly has been said to me that these people do not have rights [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1967.3600000000001s)]
*  And usually the argument is something about like well they voted for hamas or what you know, these just ridiculous arguments [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1971.7s)]
*  um, but [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1978.26s)]
*  I'm sorry, you know there there also is something [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1980.26s)]
*  Where it's it does seem to me to be a little bit different to let like spread [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1984.5s)]
*  bigotry against a group if the dynamic is that one of the groups is being slaughtered in mass [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1991.76s)]
*  And the other group is doing the slaughtering [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=1999.14s)]
*  I am a little bit more appalled by [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2002.5s)]
*  dehumanization of the people being slaughtered [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2005.6s)]
*  Than dehumanization of the people doing the slaughter. I don't think that's completely unreasonable, you know, like I don't think that if if you [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2008.3400000000001s)]
*  could teleport yourself back to um, like [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2015.8600000000001s)]
*  1840 [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2020.88s)]
*  And you were just like dehumanizing black people who were slaves or you were dehumanizing the slave owners [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2022.02s)]
*  I wouldn't see that as like a one-to-one completely the same thing [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2029.3s)]
*  I don't really like either of it if you're doing it based off like immutable characteristics such as race [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2032.74s)]
*  but [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2038.98s)]
*  I do find one to be a little bit more appalling. I don't think that makes you woke or a critical theorist [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2040.42s)]
*  I think it just makes you like it's just common sense [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2046.02s)]
*  um, but [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2049.46s)]
*  There there is something where it's like part of the asymmetry here is that these people are doing this [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2051.14s)]
*  They are actually arguing this point to me in all of these debates and yet then i'm still supposed to just be appalled by memes [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2057.2200000000003s)]
*  Or something like that. It just doesn't exactly make sense to me. I think that [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2064.82s)]
*  there is um [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2069.94s)]
*  There there's a lot that's going on typically when uh, when [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2073.3s)]
*  You have the rise of this this kind of uh, you know [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2078.82s)]
*  Dehumanization on on both sides. I think none of that is good. None of it's good. I don't like it [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2083.06s)]
*  I'm you know, and I do not support it and I certainly will never be participating in that [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2089.54s)]
*  I also do again. I should mention this [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2094.82s)]
*  Again, because it's not again. It's not like my number one priority, but I do think that they're getting it all wrong [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2097.86s)]
*  Like I think all of the arguments that are that are made against jews rather than just against like say the jews who are [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2104.26s)]
*  Involved in this or the government of israel or something like that. I think they all become pretty weak [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2111.54s)]
*  um, they the the you know, we've briefly touched on this I think before but all of the like talmud arguments [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2117.46s)]
*  I think are very weak from a bunch of people who have never read the thing and if they [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2123.86s)]
*  If they even tried to don't even know how to um, I also think it's something that the idea that the talmud like plays a major [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2129.3s)]
*  Role in most jewish people's lives is just false. It's just not true [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2135.62s)]
*  Um [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2140.42s)]
*  There's lots of other arguments like that that I think are very weak that I think i've seen people make the argument which is [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2141.6200000000003s)]
*  Identical in its weakness to the argument that somehow [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2149.04s)]
*  Like the palestinian people have forfeited their rights or something like that where the the pro-zionist crowd will argue that look [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2153.54s)]
*  An opinion poll because they don't have an election since 2005 [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2161.06s)]
*  So the an opinion poll says that the people in gaza support hamas [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2164.66s)]
*  Which by the way for the record i'm always a little skeptical of these opinion polls that are taking place in the middle of a war [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2168.82s)]
*  but whatever [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2174.26s)]
*  um, but the people of gaza support hamas [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2175.62s)]
*  And and then they'll make the same argument on the other side. They'll be like well jewish people by this percentage support israel, but [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2179.46s)]
*  I always find these arguments to just be terrible people are easily [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2186.42s)]
*  Propagandized and that's not that's not a comment on what separates us [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2190.72s)]
*  It's a comment on what unites all of us people are propagandized [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2194.74s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember a time 20 years ago where every goddamn right winger in this country was convinced [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2198.58s)]
*  That saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was in on 9 11. And if you don't believe that you're just some type of homo [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2205.2999999999997s)]
*  It's what every goddamn right winger except for 200 of them who were great every other right winger in this country [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2212.8199999999997s)]
*  Accepted that view for and it led to a war where hundreds of thousands of people died [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2218.6600000000003s)]
*  But I don't know they were propagandized into it [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2225.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to look at that and say this is a comment on this group. I I just think it's a weak argument [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2227.5400000000004s)]
*  So anyway [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2233.94s)]
*  I don't like any of that stuff [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2235.2200000000003s)]
*  Now that but you know [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2237.6200000000003s)]
*  Now can we talk about what actually matters? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2239.6200000000003s)]
*  Now can we talk about what's actually going on in the world? So anyway, there it is [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2242.34s)]
*  That's my comment don't like bigotry against jews don't like bigotry against palestinians [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2247.06s)]
*  I've seen a whole lot of both of it. Only one of those groups is getting slaughtered right now, though [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2252.18s)]
*  That's kind of the bottom line [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2257.22s)]
*  That's and that's quite a bit more offensive than somebody posting a meme [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2259.22s)]
*  Is women and children getting slaughtered when they don't need to be? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2264.74s)]

*  so I [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2355.14s)]
*  Think i'm on pretty solid ground making that argument [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2356.58s)]
*  I'm trying to think if there's like one or two other points I wanted to make in here because I don't want to [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2359.54s)]
*  Just be giving this rant again for quite a while [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2363.54s)]
*  um [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2366.66s)]
*  but [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2367.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, I guess I guess we could leave it at that. I I think that um, there is also [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2369.86s)]
*  you know [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2376.2599999999998s)]
*  Like what I was saying before like it does matter who has power, you know, that is a relevant factor [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2377.94s)]
*  Why do we have to be the condemning? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2383.7s)]
*  Good like [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2385.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know. It's not our job people or where are you going to get there and condemn? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2387.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like am I the am I the condemning department of the internet? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2391.3799999999997s)]
*  Is that was that how I got into comedy and podcasting? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2395.3799999999997s)]
*  Is that on a weekly basis I get out there and I give out my condemnations and now people are like [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2398.5s)]
*  Why didn't this person make your condemning list? You know what I mean? It's like people [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2403.7799999999997s)]
*  How often do we get out and condemn people other than the government and fauci? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2408.4199999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean, I don't know there's just something it's like we're not the condemning department [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2413.38s)]
*  It's not like hey, how come my trash wasn't picked up here the trash department. Why is my trash picked up? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2417.38s)]
*  I don't pick up the trash. That's not what I do. So when people are shouting at you [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2422.2599999999998s)]
*  Hey, how come you haven't condemned this person? That's not what we do [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2425.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I do think to some degree. It's that simple. Um, but I I mean, I just also think that [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2430.1s)]
*  you treat things [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2436.74s)]
*  With a level of seriousness based on what they you know, because because like for example rob if um [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2438.58s)]
*  Let's just say like [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2446.74s)]
*  Uh, I I don't know like cnn [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2448.98s)]
*  You know imagine back in the day when cnn still existed but like cnn [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2452.02s)]
*  And the white house and a third of of congress had all been taken over by people who hated jews and were talking about [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2456.26s)]
*  What we ought to do to them [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2463.86s)]
*  Me and you would probably start being in the condemning that business, you know what I mean? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2465.94s)]
*  Like we would start going like hey, this is really disturbing and what's the difference there? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2470.1s)]
*  Well, the difference is power and of course power matters in these things [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2474.42s)]
*  In the same way that like if there was just uh, if there was some like schizophrenic guy who's in prison [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2479.1400000000003s)]
*  Just like a poor, you know, uh completely powerless imprisoned person [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2486.5s)]
*  Um, he's in there for like armed robbery and he's doing 10 years and he said in jail he goes I want to kill the president [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2491.86s)]
*  you know [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2499.1400000000003s)]
*  Okay, but then like if the leader of like [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2500.82s)]
*  jsoc [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2505.04s)]
*  Said like I want to kill the president and also had like the white house scoped out and had men around them or something [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2506.5s)]
*  You're going to take that a lot more seriously. That's like, whoa, there's somebody with actual capabilities and actual, you know what I mean? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2513.3s)]
*  Like whatever I don't know what just an example in my head, but there's um [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2518.9s)]
*  There is something different about being like, okay there are memes and people talking shit on the internet [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2525.7000000000003s)]
*  But nobody with any real power is even allowed to go near these opinions [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2532.9s)]
*  Lest they lose all of the that power. Um [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2538.26s)]
*  Yeah, it just doesn't have as much importance to me and that's kind of how I feel [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2542.58s)]
*  I I don't think it's that crazy to go like, you know, and and again [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2547.3s)]
*  one of the things that's that's frustrating about this is that the [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2551.78s)]
*  especially the kind of [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2555.86s)]
*  conservatism inc [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2558.4s)]
*  zionist crowd [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2559.86s)]
*  They would completely agree with me on this point if we were talking about any other group [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2562.02s)]
*  You know if there was like some uh a black kid [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2568.02s)]
*  At an ivy league school [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2572.18s)]
*  And they were complaining about how like [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2574.3399999999997s)]
*  You know some I don't know some some member of the clan [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2577.7s)]
*  Said something racist [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2582.4199999999996s)]
*  Any black conservative or any conservative I should say would immediately be like yeah [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2584.5s)]
*  But you're at an ivy league school. You're about to go take on the world [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2588.5s)]
*  That's some backward redneck in their mother's trailer. Who cares? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2592.3399999999997s)]
*  Why do you care what they say? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2596.8199999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? And like the idea that [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2598.8199999999997s)]
*  People you know if you think about the level of [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2601.54s)]
*  Support let's say I was gonna say influence but forget that because that might even be like a triggering term to some of these guys [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2606.5s)]
*  Let's say the level of support that israel gets from the u.s. Government [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2612.34s)]
*  But then you're complaining that people in the united states of america [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2617.22s)]
*  Say mean things about jews [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2621.86s)]
*  like [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2624.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, but like you're you've won this game [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2625.86s)]
*  You have the power they have none [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2629.7799999999997s)]
*  And so what is is my role to be when I completely oppose that dynamic? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2632.5s)]
*  I oppose the u.s supporting israel. I oppose what israel is doing to palestine [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2637.7s)]
*  It doesn't seem kind of like a convenient game that you're gonna say that my role now [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2642.02s)]
*  Is to go and denounce all of the people who oppose that who aren't sensitive enough about their opposition toward that [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2648.02s)]
*  That that is what I have to go do is talk about this. Meanwhile, there is [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2656.02s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how to even measure these things [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2661.54s)]
*  I was gonna say just as much but I think there's more but I I guess I don't even know how to measure these things [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2663.22s)]
*  But there's also a tremendous amount of the same type of dehumanizing rhetoric toward the palestinians [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2668.58s)]
*  when [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2675.3s)]
*  You know what i'm saying with the people who are actually being fucked over right now [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2676.34s)]
*  And and the people who I debate with are actually presenting these arguments to me [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2680.42s)]
*  Like you may not think of them in a in terms of like racism or bigotry but again [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2684.9s)]
*  Imagine [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2693.0400000000004s)]
*  That like the argument I was making in a debate or something like that was that jewish people had lost all of their rights [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2694.26s)]
*  That they're that you have no right. You have every right to just go slaughter innocent [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2701.46s)]
*  uh jewish people [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2705.5400000000004s)]
*  They imagined so somebody was actually making that argument by the way [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2707.7000000000003s)]
*  I have not heard that argument made by anyone and i'm not saying nobody has made it [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2710.66s)]
*  But i'm saying even of the people who are labeled vicious anti-semites [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2715.7s)]
*  I've never seen any of them make the argument that regular jewish people [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2719.7799999999997s)]
*  By their support of israel being in too high numbers have now lost all natural rights, but that is [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2724.2599999999998s)]
*  Precisely the argument that mark pellegrino made to me in our last debate [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2730.88s)]
*  It's precisely the argument that laura loomer made to me when we debated like literally they are saying that [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2735.94s)]
*  They are saying they've lost their rights laura loomer's argument was that um [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2742.98s)]
*  Essentially that because they haven't overthrown the status quo [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2748.34s)]
*  Which is hamas therefore they've lost their rights because the obligation is on them to overthrow that status quo [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2753.0600000000004s)]
*  of course I [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2759.7000000000003s)]
*  My immediate response was well [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2760.98s)]
*  Why do we get to impose these standards on them when we would never dream of imposing them on ourselves? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2763.54s)]
*  Think about what george w bush and barack obama did we didn't overthrow the status quo did we? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2768.58s)]
*  We just accepted that in fact, we reelected both of them. Okay [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2774.58s)]
*  by the way a lot of these countries [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2779.14s)]
*  or [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2781.78s)]
*  Whatever you want to call them territories gaza. They had an election in 2005 [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2782.98s)]
*  They never got a chance a choice to reelect hamas or to continue hamas they had one election in 2005 [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2787.14s)]
*  Where hamas took a plurality? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2793.7s)]
*  Okay [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2795.7799999999997s)]
*  um [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2796.74s)]
*  But anyway, so by her own logic we'd be more responsible than they are [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2798.2599999999998s)]
*  But anyway, that was her and then mark pellegrino's argument was that um because hamas is not a rights respecting organization [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2802.5s)]
*  Therefore none of the people under their control have rights [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2809.62s)]
*  So i'm just saying like if you want to talk about [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2813.7s)]
*  Prejudice or bigotry or dehumanizing rhetoric that seems pretty up there to me [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2817.36s)]
*  so [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2823.22s)]
*  You know, sorry, that's just how I feel. I don't like any of that stuff [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2824.34s)]
*  You're not going to catch me doing any of that stuff. Now. Can we get back to talking about what actually matters? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2827.7799999999997s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is my patriot supply [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2833.06s)]
*  We're in crunch time now a new administration will be sworn in soon [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2838.82s)]
*  But many people are worried about the next month that we still have to wait for that [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2842.74s)]
*  And it does seem like there's a lot of craziness around the world [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2848.02s)]
*  And I know there's a lot of people out there who are like me who always want to be prepared in a crazy world [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2850.8199999999997s)]
*  That's why I have emergency food supplies from my patriot supply and right now [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2856.2599999999998s)]

*  It should be to you too go to my website prepare with smith.com [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2893.22s)]

*  Okay [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2904.2599999999998s)]
*  Speaking of what actually matters [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2905.2999999999997s)]
*  And maybe this is a lot more important than somebody posting a meme that they don't like I I swear to god rob [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2907.94s)]
*  I saw a clip of this on twitter. You sent me this video, uh this morning [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2916.18s)]
*  So I don't remember exactly what time but sometime this morning you sent me this, uh, this video which is a um, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2921.46s)]
*  uh [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2928.9s)]
*  Was it from uh 60 minutes? I want to say yes from pretty wild 60 minutes now. I saw a clip of this [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2930.26s)]
*  on twitter [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2938.5800000000004s)]
*  And I swear to god. I there's like right when I woke up this morning. It's like 6 30 [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2940.34s)]
*  Uh around then I'd had a cup of coffee. I think I was on the toilet and I saw this on twitter [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2945.14s)]
*  And I just thought it was made up [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2951.54s)]
*  I just saw it and I went oh, huh. That's hilarious [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2954.42s)]
*  They edited a video together where it's the 60 minutes lady and she's interviewing a masade [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2957.38s)]
*  Agent and the masade agent is all in dark going. Yes, we control the galaxy [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2963.2999999999997s)]
*  And then we are the dark force that rules everything and I went ha ha ha ha ha [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2968.02s)]
*  What a funny joke that somebody on the internet made turns out it's not a funny joke rob [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2972.98s)]
*  As I swear to god it was five minutes later [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2980.1000000000004s)]
*  I went to open my emails and I saw rob sent over as typically you do [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2982.1000000000004s)]
*  Hey, here's some topic ideas and I looked at that and I went wait a minute. This is a real thing [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2985.7000000000003s)]
*  This actually just happened [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2990.26s)]
*  I mean this is it was a while. We're having this conversation about memes [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2992.34s)]
*  Let's play a clip from uh 60 minutes [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2996.7400000000002s)]
*  And see if any of this seems a little bit more important than a meme [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=2999.22s)]
*  Yes, so israel sold this device [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3002.8199999999997s)]
*  To hesbola hesbola paid for this weapon [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3007.54s)]
*  That was to be used against them [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3011.62s)]
*  They gotta contrast [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3013.9399999999996s)]
*  A good price that couldn't be too low or they'd be suspicious [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3015.7799999999997s)]
*  In the end hesbola bought over 16 000 of these exploding walkie talkies [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3021.06s)]
*  That israel then didn't activate for 10 years until three months ago [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3026.6s)]
*  How did you convince hesbola to buy this? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3032.44s)]
*  Well, obviously they didn't know that they were buying it from israel. Who did they buy it from or I think they were buying it from [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3036.52s)]
*  We have an incredible array of possibilities [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3043.0s)]
*  of creating foreign companies that have [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3047.16s)]
*  No way being traced back to israel shell companies over shell companies who affect the supply chain to our favor [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3050.76s)]
*  We create a pretend world. We are a global production company. We write the screenplay [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3057.88s)]
*  We're the directors with the producers. We're the main actors [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3064.52s)]
*  The world is our stage [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3068.76s)]
*  This is mosad's old [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3070.6800000000003s)]
*  All right, let's let's pause it there and discuss [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3072.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think you could kind of see why I this was like the perfect segue from what i've just been talking about [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3075.88s)]
*  All i'm saying is this rob is that if there is really the concern? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3081.72s)]
*  Of the rise of a rise in anti-semitism [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3087.3199999999997s)]
*  Isn't it interesting because I I can't tell you how many people just came at me in the most bad faith way [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3091.96s)]
*  Over the last couple days over this jake shields meme on twitter, which is as I say it out loud. It's just so ridiculous [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3097.88s)]
*  It's so ridiculous that a guy you know said something we disagree with i'm like, okay. Well, he's right here [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3103.3999999999996s)]
*  so go talk to him like what but [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3109.08s)]
*  As people are making these arguments and the argument is something like oh i'm [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3112.12s)]
*  Normalizing anti-semitism because i'll be friendly with these guys or even friends with some of these guys [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3117.14s)]
*  Therefore i'm contributing to this problem or something like that [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3122.98s)]
*  and you're like [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3127.96s)]
*  Me maybe it's me [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3129.16s)]
*  Obviously when we're talking about me i'm biased. I have a dog in this fight [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3130.92s)]
*  um [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3135.32s)]
*  It seems to me that this clip would be much more encouraging of the rise of anti-semitism [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3137.0s)]
*  You know what i'm saying rob like wouldn't this is like actual what I am to [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3142.2000000000003s)]
*  I would think I mean to [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3149.4s)]
*  Being I'm a guy who liked most people even if they don't like jews very much or are very critical of israel [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3152.36s)]
*  I'm kind of at least being an example to them where like I treat them with decency [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3159.8s)]
*  I try to I try my best at least to like take on the merits of their arguments and grant when they have some legitimate grievances [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3163.8s)]
*  um [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3171.7200000000003s)]
*  And then to be an example of just being like hey, you know [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3172.6800000000003s)]
*  You can oppose this war and oppose it pretty passionately and come from I would argue a pretty educated informed [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3175.64s)]
*  Uh place on it and go win debates pretty dominantly against people against it and oppose all of that [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3182.12s)]
*  While being jewish and treating people decently and not you know, whatever [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3188.36s)]
*  And then you have someone else here who's going [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3192.44s)]
*  Muahahaha [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3194.58s)]
*  Mossad controls the world the jews run everything and you are our puppets [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3196.02s)]
*  And somehow that you don't think that's going to lead to a rise and people maybe being suspicious of jews [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3201.64s)]
*  anyway, of course and i'm curious to get your comments on this but [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3208.04s)]
*  Of course they're having this interview to kind of brag [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3211.8s)]
*  About the attack on hesbola the the beeper cell phone attacks [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3215.0s)]
*  And yet of course as is always the case with the war party whether it's israeli or american [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3219.72s)]
*  They they always just have so much hubris that they can't help but give away [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3225.24s)]
*  Kind of like what villains they really are. But anyway, and any thoughts on any of this rob, please weigh it [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3230.92s)]
*  Exactly as you said [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3236.44s)]
*  I mean for all the people in the world you think like to think that we're the shadow creatures behind the scenes running the world [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3237.88s)]
*  And the puppet masters having a guy dressed like I mean even the isis terrorist guys don't usually wear masks [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3243.88s)]
*  But usually when you don't want to even be on the news with their face like the drug dealers when they do the segments from like [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3249.2400000000002s)]
*  South america and then they overdub the voices they don't get in trouble to be standing there going we are the directors [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3254.36s)]
*  Not a great look [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3261.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know who thought that this uh would make israel look better, but this didn't seem like a wise pr choice [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3262.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there is there is an infuriating thing [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3268.92s)]
*  That many of the people at the top of the israeli leadership [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3273.16s)]
*  And I mean all the way up to benjamin netanyahu himself [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3277.64s)]
*  But this is also something that um that lots of just israel israeli supporters do where they try to [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3280.12s)]
*  Simultaneously, it's like the whole backstory and the whole narrative that they rely on in order to kind of [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3288.18s)]
*  Um draw support and in order to twist your emotions and in order to kind of silence dissent [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3296.12s)]
*  The narrative that they rely on is like listen [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3303.08s)]
*  We are this weak group of people the greatest victims [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3306.6s)]
*  Yeah, the greatest victims of the 20th century, you know, these are the people who went through the holocaust were nearly exterminated [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3311.48s)]
*  we now have this tiny little dot in a sea of [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3318.6800000000003s)]
*  Hostile arab and and muslim, uh neighbors were a little country the size of new jersey in this broad [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3323.4s)]
*  Muslim world and they would all tear us to parts if they could you know, like there's this constant [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3331.1600000000003s)]
*  Like over [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3339.8s)]
*  Dramatization of [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3342.7400000000002s)]
*  the precarious position [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3344.84s)]
*  That israeli jews find themselves in and that's why you must be sympathetic for them. That's why you must be on guard against [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3347.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh people who hate jews and stuff like that [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3354.84s)]
*  They say that and then on the flip side [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3358.44s)]
*  They'll turn around and brag about how they actually run the whole world [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3361.0s)]
*  And there's a plethora of options available to us on how to manipulate everyone and benjamin netanyahu will brag about how [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3365.0s)]
*  Israel can touch anywhere in the middle east and and the ever I forget how he said it like the ever present eye of israel [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3372.6s)]
*  Is always on you and there and it's kind of like hey, which one is it here guys? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3379.56s)]
*  Are you? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3384.84s)]
*  Like are you america's fat welfare mom who needs us to fund and arm every one of your conflicts? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3386.28s)]
*  Are you the the victim on the precipice of total annihilation? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3393.96s)]
*  Or are you the dominant powerful ones who will impose your will on everybody else because it's pretty tough to be both of those [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3399.1s)]
*  things at the same time [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3406.38s)]
*  You kind of have to pick [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3408.7s)]
*  like [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3410.94s)]
*  It's just like this shit is out of a cartoon [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3411.9s)]
*  And and like to to sit here and be bragging [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3415.26s)]
*  about [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3418.7s)]
*  how [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3419.66s)]
*  You this is how how you you know you tricked hesbullah and and they bought these weapons 10 years ago [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3420.54s)]
*  Not thinking there was anything to them and you were able to sit on it [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3427.5s)]
*  You have all these shell companies that can't be traced back to israel [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3431.5s)]
*  and this is how you like control other and then to sit in a dynamic where [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3435.26s)]
*  Every single one of our politicians has to go cry at the wailing wall [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3439.82s)]
*  You know and you do [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3444.06s)]
*  Like this is what leads to people going like, huh? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3445.6600000000003s)]
*  All right, it seems like you might be using some of your massage tricks on us as well [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3448.94s)]
*  Uh, the other thing that I hated about this, uh, this reporting [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3455.5s)]
*  is uh [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3460.46s)]
*  You know if israel pulled off a targeted strike and managed to just take out just terrors and they pulled some sneaky [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3461.66s)]
*  Bugs bunny tricks. I go. Wow, that's pretty cool. You guys figured out how to not kill civilians [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3468.14s)]
*  It is still unclear to me how many civilians were actually killed in this attack [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3473.1s)]
*  And even at the beginning of this they just say I think 11 000 people were killed or injured or this thing [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3477.18s)]
*  But they don't differentiate [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3482.14s)]
*  How do you possibly start off a piece addressing a targeted strike that they did without addressing if there were or were not civilian casualties? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3484.14s)]
*  And how many civilian casualties were a part of it? I mean just if you're you're not the israel propaganda department [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3491.82s)]
*  So if you're inviting them on to kind of explore their targeted attack and how slick they are and that all the terrorists should be [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3497.66s)]
*  On notice because you're so slick [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3503.74s)]
*  How do you don't you need to give me a breakdown up front of exactly what actually took place? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3505.5s)]
*  And not just glance over the crucial piece of information and just go [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3510.78s)]
*  Well this incident took place and this amount of people were killed without telling me how many of them were civilians [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3514.46s)]
*  Like how i'm just saying how do you start a piece about this topic without the most critical? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3520.2200000000003s)]
*  Just basic information to evaluate what transpired [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3525.7400000000002s)]
*  Well as uh, ayan rand might tell you you need to check your premises [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3529.66s)]
*  Um because you're starting with the premise that they're not the israel, uh, the israeli propaganda department, uh, which might [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3535.44s)]
*  Might be incorrect. Um, you know the other problem [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3542.88s)]
*  that the other issue that you have [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3547.04s)]
*  From a pr standpoint and I mean don't get me wrong. I think this is a legitimate [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3550.0s)]
*  Issue, but just from a pr standpoint you have a real problem where like let's even just say for the sake of argument that [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3554.32s)]
*  Civilian casualties were very low [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3562.2400000000002s)]
*  In in these beeper cell phone attacks against these hesbola guys [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3564.96s)]
*  The the problem that you have from a pr standpoint for israel is that then it just creates this immediate [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3570.88s)]
*  Contrast between the way you're fighting the war in in gaza versus the way you're fighting the war in lebanon [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3577.42s)]
*  And they wait like wait a minute. This is at your disposal [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3582.64s)]
*  You're telling me you have the option to do targeted assassinations to do [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3586.0s)]
*  you know, uh [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3591.76s)]
*  Intelligence operations and not just treat this as a military problem and not just send in your army [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3593.28s)]
*  Oh [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3600.96s)]
*  Well, then why aren't you doing that? Why didn't you prepare something like this for gaza? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3602.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not as if gaza has been an issue for [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3605.92s)]
*  Only a few years, you know, they said oh it was 10 years since they sold these things to hamas [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3610.0s)]
*  Who knows if that to uh, hezbollah rather who knows if that's true or not [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3614.4s)]
*  But if that's the case why weren't you working on something like this in the gaza strip? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3618.24s)]
*  So you didn't have to just slaughter, you know the um [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3623.2s)]
*  Innocent people by the I mean, I don't even know exactly what the numbers are at this point [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3627.04s)]
*  I've i've seen uh people argue that it's way way higher than the estimates are [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3631.6s)]
*  Um, i'm not sure whether that's right or not, but certainly the the amount of carnage has been substantial [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3635.68s)]
*  Um, so why why not fight them like that all the time? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3641.92s)]
*  It's it's very hard for you to brag that like oh right here on the north [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3645.2s)]
*  We can do these targeted assassination campaigns and have very little civilian casualties [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3650.48s)]
*  But right here on the south and by the way again, we're talking about the north and south of new jersey [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3655.28s)]
*  Not you know what I mean? Like not not uh, like some gigantic country [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3660.08s)]
*  So a few miles over down here, we just have to slaughter women and children. There's no other options. That's a tough sell [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3664.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, the other thing that I thought was cartoonish about this piece is uh, firstly [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3671.12s)]
*  And this is part of the problem with the internet is that you go to even the news organizations websites [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3675.2s)]
*  To watch the video and they're always slow to load with more ads [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3681.84s)]
*  So then you just end up going to youtube and you're like this was so much easier [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3684.8s)]
*  Why can't every other website just get their shit together? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3688.2400000000002s)]
*  So we don't all all have to be on youtube and contribute to what that landscape is [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3690.8s)]
*  With that said when I went to the cbs, uh website [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3695.68s)]
*  So, of course the segment starts off with an ad from Pfizer [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3699.36s)]
*  It's segment brought to you by Pfizer and if you're you and I and you know what we know about the news and the media [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3703.2799999999997s)]
*  It's just uh funny to watch israel propaganda mainstream media brought to you by Pfizer [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3709.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's a goddamn joke. The whole thing is so it's so just like out of a cartoon [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3716.16s)]
*  um, but I I think you know, I guess in closing with all of this it's [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3721.2s)]
*  I I think that [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3729.52s)]
*  I I am [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3731.92s)]
*  At least to the best of my abilities [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3733.68s)]
*  I think i'm being consistent with how I view these type of issues across the board like [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3735.2799999999997s)]
*  One of the things and and I will confess this [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3740.8s)]
*  uh, and and I don't know how you feel about this rob, but [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3744.16s)]
*  there definitely is something when like [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3747.84s)]
*  You know when people [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3751.68s)]
*  Online, let's say like the anti-semitism again a word. I just hate but [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3753.68s)]
*  When people online are expressing say like, uh [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3758.08s)]
*  A dislike of jews. It's a little bit of a weird feeling when you're jewish to like [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3762.8799999999997s)]
*  Hear that stuff. It's a little bit weird and you're kind of like, ah, hey guys [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3769.2799999999997s)]
*  it's like talking about me and my family and friends and you know, the the truth is that [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3773.7599999999998s)]
*  I I do have a little bit of that feeling like a little bit of it [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3780.72s)]
*  But I also have another like I then I also go like well [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3784.72s)]
*  Hey, I have to be fair and I have to be consistent and I can't if I have a different feeling than I would view [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3787.76s)]
*  Anyone else if about their group? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3793.68s)]
*  I can't just like do what these other guys do where you have this entire worldview [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3795.92s)]
*  But then there's an exception for when it's your group and then you have to totally have a different [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3800.08s)]
*  You know what? I mean, like I don't like that that that type of hypocrisy is terrible to me [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3803.76s)]
*  um, and so [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3808.32s)]
*  There you know there there I do have that feeling it's just impossible to not look at it and go [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3810.0s)]
*  Oh look, I got to treat this the same way [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3815.6s)]
*  I would treat anybody else if anybody else let's say it had nothing it was a black dude [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3817.36s)]
*  But he's exactly in my situation and his complaint was hey [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3822.16s)]
*  There's these people online who aren't being very nice to black people and I'd go like yeah, but look at you [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3825.6800000000003s)]
*  You're doing great [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3832.08s)]
*  It's like what? I don't know what this has nothing to do with you. This isn't impeding your progress at all [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3833.44s)]
*  Um, the the truth is that [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3838.8s)]
*  Probably not in the top five reasons, but one of the reasons [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3842.0s)]
*  Down there on the list maybe in top 10 or top 15 reasons that this shit drives me fucking crazy [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3847.36s)]
*  Is that I do feel like they're totally like throwing my group of people under the bus [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3855.36s)]
*  You know, it's it's amazing that um, so I got like a few people because I was arguing with you know [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3860.96s)]
*  A lot of these like pro israel types over the last few days on twitter and I had several of them including one young [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3865.36s)]
*  reporter [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3871.7400000000002s)]
*  Um who would have been a good fit for the old media model? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3873.2000000000003s)]
*  um, but he basically said to me and I never even posted this I thought about tweeting it and then I just [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3878.2400000000002s)]
*  I was like forget it. I'm not engaging anymore. But he said to me he goes, uh, dave the only reason why you're uh, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3883.6s)]
*  You're even known is because you're the token jew who will go on these shows [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3890.64s)]
*  And so you'll take some heat off the host so they're like look we don't hate jews [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3896.72s)]
*  We got a token jew right here for you and I remember immediately. I thought I go, you know [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3900.3199999999997s)]
*  I've only heard that criticism from two groups of people [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3904.48s)]
*  There are two groups of people who have made that ridiculous retarded argument to me and it is zionists [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3908.64s)]
*  and gropers [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3916.0s)]
*  Those are the two people who go will reduce everything you are just to the fact that you're jewish and isn't that interesting? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3917.6s)]
*  In a way that that you guys share the same world view here [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3924.0s)]
*  Because obviously it does look even if you could make the argument it would only apply to candace owens [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3927.92s)]
*  There is nobody else who you could even make candace owens was the only one who was real hardcore against [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3933.92s)]
*  the [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3940.32s)]
*  Against israel and then brought me on where we were going to talk about israel [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3941.12s)]
*  Now I would argue I don't think that's why she did it [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3946.3999999999996s)]
*  I think maybe she just liked the stuff that I had to say and we had a good conversation and we became friends [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3948.8799999999997s)]
*  And we got along that seems more likely to me, but she is the only one you could even plausibly make that argument about [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3953.52s)]
*  Rogan I requested to come on and talk about israel both times that we did podcasts about israel [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3960.54s)]
*  Like he requested me to come on after the election and he requested me to come on to talk about covid [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3966.0s)]
*  Uh vaccine passports and covid lockdowns and shit [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3971.3599999999997s)]
*  But I was the one who asked him if I could go talk about this shit because I wanted to like set the record straight [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3974.3999999999996s)]
*  Tucker never even wanted to talk about israel. I just kept bringing it up. You know what I mean? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3980.24s)]
*  So it's like it's just not but anyway these two groups [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3984.3199999999997s)]
*  Both because they and this is what i'm talking about [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3987.8399999999997s)]
*  It's this I think this collectivism puts blinders on a lot of times and you don't get things right [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3989.9199999999996s)]
*  It makes you sloppy in your work. And then if you're after the truth, that's the truth is that [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=3995.12s)]
*  I think [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4000.64s)]
*  that [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4002.3999999999996s)]
*  Israel and the neoconservatives [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4003.44s)]
*  Cynically use jewish identity and and weaponize it so that they can get into this game [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4006.14s)]
*  So that they can claim your anti-semitic you hate jews if you don't support what israel's doing [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4013.44s)]
*  That's the that and and I think embracing that is wrong [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4019.84s)]
*  I um [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4023.44s)]
*  Do not have even [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4025.2000000000003s)]
*  in ounce of contempt for jewish people I actually have [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4027.52s)]
*  No, and and this isn't something I talk about all the time because I don't think it's that relevant to politics [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4033.52s)]
*  Or to this show or to the issues I really care about but I have um [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4039.36s)]
*  no limit of just like [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4045.04s)]
*  Positive feelings about jewish culture and jewish people i've met amazing jews my entire life [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4047.98s)]
*  I think it's it's uh played a role in shaping who I am as a person. I love jewish humor. I love um [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4054.4s)]
*  I love [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4063.52s)]
*  jewish people's love of logic [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4064.96s)]
*  I like their values around family like there's a lot of things that I think i've gotten that are somewhat influenced by jewish culture [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4067.28s)]
*  Um, and I just I I don't know I have nothing negative that being said to me that has nothing to do [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4074.96s)]
*  with masad [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4081.6s)]
*  Doing influence operations all around the world or the israel war cabinet [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4083.28s)]
*  Slaughtering palestinian women and children. I hate that shit [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4088.2200000000003s)]
*  But that has nothing to do with [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4092.2400000000002s)]
*  Like in the same sense again, by the way, and i'll just end on this. I'm sorry [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4094.7200000000003s)]
*  But the fact that I think sometimes individualism [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4098.16s)]
*  Can get um caricatured can get straw manned and i'm not making the argument that [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4102.4800000000005s)]
*  people are [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4109.280000000001s)]
*  atomized [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4111.34s)]
*  Individuals who have no connection to community or people or culture or religion or race or anything like that [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4112.7s)]
*  In if you do believe in individualism you obviously also believe in groups because that's what individuals do they come together and form groups? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4120.96s)]
*  The point is that it's a unit of analysis like if you read ludwig von mises, that's what you understand about individualism [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4130.8s)]
*  It's a unit of analysis. It's the way because individuals act and individuals suffer and individuals, you know [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4137.28s)]
*  think like this is the way human beings work and [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4144.16s)]
*  The point is that [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4148.08s)]
*  It's not to say [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4150.24s)]
*  That race like if I were to say race means nothing [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4152.24s)]
*  Well, that would be kind of silly right because you're like well, obviously race is a thing. There's a genetic reality to race [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4156.5599999999995s)]
*  There's also culture and traditions and identity and all of these things that that come together [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4163.28s)]
*  however [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4169.28s)]
*  If I were to talk about let's say [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4170.88s)]
*  Um, let's say you got like a black dentist who lives in new jersey [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4174.0s)]
*  Who's my neighbor? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4179.76s)]
*  and then you have [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4181.5199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4183.04s)]
*  A black gang banger in the south side of chicago who just stabbed an old lady [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4183.92s)]
*  Do you see where me if I even tried to place some of the blame on my black dentist neighbor that that's just insane [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4191.5199999999995s)]
*  I'd be like, well, this is black people did this black culture did this black it'd be like no [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4199.04s)]
*  He could love a million different things about black culture and then still go. Yeah, but that guy's an animal [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4204.48s)]
*  Fuck him. I hope he gets arrested and does a long prison prison sentence [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4210.32s)]
*  That to me is the fundamental distinction [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4215.5199999999995s)]
*  then it's like [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4218.0s)]
*  One does not have to be a comment on the other now you could argue in some way [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4219.68s)]
*  Well, there is this corner of black culture that somehow produced this kid who stabbed a grandma [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4223.92s)]
*  Okay, fair enough, but that doesn't mean that you therefore have to slam like everything about black culture that my black dentist neighbor might like [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4228.88s)]
*  I think that's just a fairly reasonable like [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4238.64s)]
*  Something in eighth grader should be able to like this might it might be a little advanced for fifth grade [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4242.32s)]
*  But by eighth grade for sure, I think you should get that. Okay [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4247.28s)]
*  Anyway, any anything you want to add to the end there rob or we'll we'll [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4250.48s)]
*  Now I gotta go clean up this airbnb [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4254.5599999999995s)]
*  It's that horrible thing that they charge you the cleaning fee and then give you [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4256.16s)]
*  Instructions to repaint the entire house before you leave it. It is enough that I never stay at airbnb is because of that [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4259.74s)]
*  I literally it drives me crazy. Yeah, it's enough that i'll pay more and just stay at a hotel [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4266.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the other give me a cleaning fee or if not [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4271.36s)]
*  I don't know why I gotta strip the beds take out the garbage rake the leaves like I don't own the house [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4273.68s)]
*  Yes, I will pay a hundred dollars more just to stay at a hotel where it is clear that I am going to drop [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4278.639999999999s)]
*  A towel in the middle of the floor and he on it. Someone else will figure that out [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4283.36s)]
*  Well, I had to be [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4287.92s)]
*  The bathroom's all the way over there [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4289.36s)]
*  All right later buddy. Later buddy. Thanks everyone for watching catch you next time. Peace [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4291.92s)]
*  You [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--y4O9Fuiys&t=4308.16s)]
