# Dave Smith | Another Response to Ben Shapiro | Part Of The Problem 1264
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0)
*  What's up, what's up everybody welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the fire Bernstein. How are you good, sir? I'm doing well. How [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=11.84s)]
*  are you mr. Smith? I'm a little bit annoyed at the moment. I have some issues with Delta. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=17.04s)]
*  So, you know, this is by the way, it's a particularly for for boomers like me. And I'm not a boomer [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  technically. But I really am when it comes to a lot of this shit, especially for somebody [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=30.060000000000002s)]
*  who's like my whole job is in technology and, you know, online and podcasting and stuff. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=35.38s)]
*  But I don't know anything. But it's like, I figure out kind of what I need to know. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=42.18s)]
*  Like I'm, you know, I'm better than actual boomers. But I'm just I'm so used to flying [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=47.5s)]
*  United out of Newark. And now I'm flying Delta out of LaGuardia just because new works on [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=53.74s)]
*  fire or something. I don't know. But man, just the little things where I'm like, I know [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=58.96s)]
*  how to do this. I know how to do this on my thing. Why does it have to be different? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=64.12s)]
*  Here's here's the thing about Delta. Delta is a nice lady, but you got to marry her. You [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=69.72s)]
*  can't you can't. She's no slut. If you'll commit to Delta and you'll get their credit [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=74.4s)]
*  card. They're really nice to you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=79.6s)]
*  But I'm just not in a place where I'm ready to commit to Delta like that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=81.48s)]
*  Yeah. But if you're showing up and you're just trying to buy the main whatever, the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=85.32s)]
*  discount flight, but that's bullshit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=90.08s)]
*  Yeah, they don't then you might as well be on Spirit Airlines. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=92.4s)]
*  But Delta knew what this was. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=95.52s)]
*  They knew I'm having problems with United. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=97.2s)]
*  And so I had to come over to Delta. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=99.96s)]
*  They knew what this was. They said they were down. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=101.8s)]
*  And now they're acting like I did something wrong. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=103.92s)]
*  Look, it is an opportunity to win you over. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=107.08s)]
*  You're a good flying account. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=108.96s)]
*  You would think if they treat you nice, you might go, wow, this Delta is pretty good. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=110.96s)]
*  But no, they're a classy lady. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=114.63999999999999s)]
*  They're like, maybe that's why no one will commit to you, Delta. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=116.8s)]
*  Maybe that's why you're going to end up with a bunch of cats in an apartment, Delta, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  because you never like tried to get any. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  All right. Whatever. I get your point. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=125.36s)]
*  Good analogy. Not very happy with Delta. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  Delta's not putting out for me. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=129.56s)]
*  So things aren't working out so good on my end. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=131.28s)]
*  Anyway, the experience with Delta having its night and day like because you'll show up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=133.44s)]
*  There will be no place that you can even check in at. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=139.48s)]
*  Literally, there won't be a place you can talk to a machine. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  If you try and check in, they'll like just scoot you along. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=145.48s)]
*  But once you have status with them, they have a different place that you walk into. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  There's no line. There's a separate security line like they just they, you know, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=153.12s)]
*  it's it's class warfare out there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=158.24s)]
*  And if you're on the upper classes, they're all right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=159.88s)]
*  It's really it's particularly frustrating because I've worked my way up. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=163.16s)]
*  I've worked my way up from the bottom for so many years just to be knocked back down. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=167.24s)]
*  Listen, my my guarantee is this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=171.6s)]
*  I will be out in Appleton, Wisconsin tomorrow night. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=173.52s)]
*  I will find my way there. Don't worry. I have flights. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=176.84s)]
*  I'm just trying to get a better seat. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=179.28s)]
*  But I but I am very much looking forward to that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=180.48s)]
*  Robbie, of course, will be there as well. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=183.68s)]
*  We'll be out at the Skyline Comedy Club this week in Appleton, Wisconsin. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=186.24s)]
*  And we got a bunch of really great [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=190.88s)]
*  dates coming up, like some of my favorite clubs in the world. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=195.84s)]
*  I know we're we're going to this weekend is Appleton, Wisconsin. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=199.64s)]
*  Next is Salt Lake City. Wise guys. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=204.76s)]
*  We love that club. Great time out there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  Then we'll be for the first time doing a full weekend at the Comedy Works in Denver, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=209.6s)]
*  which is supposed to be one of the best clubs in the country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=214.88s)]
*  Very excited to work there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=217.56s)]
*  We'll be back at what is one of the best clubs in the country. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=218.92s)]
*  Cleveland Hilarities Comedy Connection in Providence, Tacoma Comedy Club, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=221.52s)]
*  Spokane Comedy Club, Detroit House Detroit House of Comedy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=225.8s)]
*  And Tampa Side Splitters. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=229.28s)]
*  Literally all of those clubs are like some of my favorite clubs to work. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=230.88s)]
*  So very much looking forward to all of that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=235.2s)]
*  Comic Dave Smith dot com is the website for all of the ticket links for the shows [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=237.36s)]
*  me and Rob are doing together. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=242.48s)]
*  And then, of course, Rob, it's a it's summer porch time or porch tour season. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=243.76s)]
*  Can we call it summer anymore because you do the full spring. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=248.68s)]
*  But that's porch tour. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=251.96s)]
*  Go to Porchstore dot com. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=253.44s)]
*  We got a run of a lot of porches coming up on Countrywide. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=254.64s)]
*  So go check out what's there. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=258.2s)]
*  Porch tour dot com. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=259.32s)]
*  There you go. All right. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=261.32s)]
*  So for today's show, you know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=262.76s)]
*  some of it, I think, will touch a little bit on the themes from from the last show. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=266.0s)]
*  But there's a little bit more that I wanted to get into. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  I want to respond to a Ben Shapiro [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  clip that's going super viral that I think I alluded to on the last show. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  But I think it's worth actually breaking down. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=280.76s)]
*  So one of the things I tell me if you think this was a good tactic, Rob, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=284.0s)]
*  but I thought it was certainly fair and none of the so, you know, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=290.12s)]
*  I mentioned on the last show that Mark Levin had called Steve [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  Wittkopf an anti-semite or using the term neocons. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=298.88s)]
*  And then, you know, Donald Trump, as we mentioned in his speech in Saudi [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=304.8s)]
*  Arabia yesterday, blasted neocons. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=308.68s)]
*  And so I challenged Mark Levin. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=311.88s)]
*  I was like, hey, so let's keep that same energy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=315.84s)]
*  Trump's an anti-semite now, right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=318.92s)]
*  And like for all the people out there, I was like, oh, all the people like [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  pushing the woke right thing and all that, it goes, it's Trump now, right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=323.84s)]
*  So aren't you guys going to add? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=328.4s)]
*  None of them are willing to do it, which is kind of funny in a way. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  Right. Because I do just I I thought this was an example [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=333.44s)]
*  that was kind of telling in a way because there's look, there's there's a major [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=338.28s)]
*  divide, obviously, it's all about foreign policy, or at least for the most part, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=345.4s)]
*  it's about foreign policy and there's different camps. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  It's not as if there's there's two neat camps that you could divide everybody into. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=353.52s)]
*  There's several different groups involved here. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=357.52s)]
*  But I do think it's interesting that like when when we talk about having [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=360.28s)]
*  principles, I don't think there's an example where you could look at me or you, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=365.24s)]
*  say, Rob, or at people in our camp, broadly speaking, the Scott Horton's of the world [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  or, you know, Tom Woods or whoever. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  And if you were to say, hey, OK, you have these principles, like if I were to say [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=379.68s)]
*  whatever, you know, blank is a war crime. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=384.44s)]
*  And then you were to go, well, Donald Trump just did blank. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=388.24s)]
*  I'd go, yeah, he just committed a war crime. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=390.68s)]
*  Like I just if I have principles, then I'm going to apply them to their logical [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  conclusion, whereas you have this very clear, like just the day before this [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  happened, you said that neoconservative is a pejorative for Jew. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=404.04s)]
*  Well, Trump just said neoconservatives. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=410.76s)]
*  So what like do you actually care about fighting anti-Semitism, you know, like [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=413.68s)]
*  because the president of the United States now, or is it only when it's his envoy [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  and you think you could like turn the rest of the administration against that guy, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=423.64s)]
*  you'll go after him. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=427.16s)]
*  But you and essentially the point is that all of them, all of them wouldn't dare. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=428.72s)]
*  They wouldn't dare apply the exact same thing to Donald Trump as we've done many, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=435.12s)]
*  many times. And I just think there's something about that that's kind of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=439.8s)]
*  revealing. It's like, OK, so then you don't actually have these principles or you're [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=443.32s)]
*  actually not very committed to these principles because it seems like that to [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=447.2s)]
*  me, that seems to be a good litmus test for like who actually has principles and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=451.96s)]
*  who's a fucking grifter. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=456.52s)]
*  Because if you're just going like, ah, well, calling Donald Trump an anti-Semite, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=458.24s)]
*  that would lose me all of my popular support. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=462.76s)]
*  And you're like, OK, then you don't really care about it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=465.28s)]
*  I don't know. I just there's something interesting on that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=468.8s)]
*  And I think it's funny that none of them want to touch it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=471.68s)]
*  None of them want to go anywhere near it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=475.32s)]
*  But anyway, it's pretty great that Donald Trump did that nonetheless. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=477.36s)]
*  But anyway, prove me wrong. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=481.12s)]
*  Mark Levin is my next. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=482.44s)]
*  Maybe she should be my next debate. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  Oh, that would be a juicy debate. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=487.88s)]
*  I would love that. Yeah, I'd have to wear earplugs to that thing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=489.28s)]
*  I'm not sure I could take that guy yelling at me. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=494.08s)]
*  Warhawk still out there, you know, the whole pitch them all. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=495.8s)]
*  Well, as we're about to go through this Ben Shapiro clip, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=500.03999999999996s)]
*  you know, I will say I don't think it's ever going to happen, but I would still [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=505.36s)]
*  I would still love to debate Ben Shapiro. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=508.76000000000005s)]
*  You know, if he's open, challenge is still in effect. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=512.64s)]
*  Any time any moderator, I would love to go do a debate with Ben Shapiro. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=516.08s)]
*  I think that would be a fun one. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=520.24s)]
*  I also don't know it like I don't know who else is left, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  at least on this topic. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't know who else is left, but I guess I'm open to other names. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=529.08s)]
*  You know, the other thing I do kind of more and more, I would [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=534.24s)]
*  I would love to have not a debate, but I would love to have a conversation. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I would do a debate, but I think it would be better [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=543.04s)]
*  just to have a conversation with Jordan Peterson. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=546.64s)]
*  He's the one I'd really like to sit down with. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=549.68s)]
*  I actually think we could have a really productive conversation. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=551.28s)]
*  He's the one at the Daily Wire who I actually think is [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=554.0s)]
*  at least was much bigger than the Daily Wire and more important than that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=558.4s)]
*  And I'm a real I'm a real admirer of a lot of his early work. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=562.16s)]
*  So he's the one I'd love to have a conversation with. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=565.68s)]
*  I'd still love to debate Ben Shapiro, but I'm not holding my breath on that one. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=567.6s)]
*  I think we got as close as we're going to get to that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=572.08s)]
*  But anyway, regardless, I did think this was worth [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=574.8s)]
*  breaking down and exploring a little bit more because it's again, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=579.36s)]
*  this is kind of it's on the same topic that we were talking about on the last show. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=582.92s)]
*  But it really does just go much like my [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=587.44s)]
*  the point I was trying to make there with Donald Trump saying neoconservative [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=590.48s)]
*  is this still pejorative for Jews? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=593.88s)]
*  It goes it goes toward exposing [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=597.16s)]
*  what people's real priorities are. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=601.44s)]
*  And I think that's something that's very important in this whole, you know, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=604.48s)]
*  debate about this current conflict to to recognize. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=608.44s)]
*  So let's jump in here is Ben Shapiro from the other day on his show. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  And me and Rob will give our thoughts. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=617.64s)]
*  Really, what Hamas is attempting to do [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=620.24s)]
*  is basically settle all outstanding business with the United States [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=627.96s)]
*  so as to then create separation between the United States and Israel [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=631.48s)]
*  in Iran negotiations. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=634.52s)]
*  That is what is happening with the Houthis as well. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=636.0s)]
*  It is not a coincidence that as the Houthis are basically [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=637.6s)]
*  for swearing attacks on American shipping and the United States is saying [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=641.0s)]
*  that the United States is no longer going to worry about the Houthis, essentially. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=644.52s)]
*  Hamas is now trying to do the same by releasing the sole living [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=647.5600000000001s)]
*  American hostage in the Gaza Strip, trying to basically say that the United States [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=650.44s)]
*  now has no part in that conflict. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=655.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, OK, fine. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=656.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, if the United States has no part in that conflict, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=657.9200000000001s)]
*  then Israel should just go into what they need to do. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=659.96s)]
*  That seems to be a proper solution with regard to the Gaza Strip. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=662.44s)]
*  Now, the ugliest part, and there is an ugly part to this, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=666.0s)]
*  is that there are widespread rumors and now news reports [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=668.6400000000001s)]
*  that Idan Alexander is going to be flown to Qatar [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=672.44s)]
*  to meet with the Emir of Qatar. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=676.4s)]
*  This is vile. That's vile. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=678.0s)]
*  OK, let's just pause it for a second. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=681.3199999999999s)]
*  You saw an American? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=683.0799999999999s)]
*  OK, look, the first thing that you kind of got to notice here [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=684.68s)]
*  and this is what I mean about kind of revealing true motivations. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=688.68s)]
*  The first thing beyond any point that you could make is that, look, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=693.6s)]
*  here are the facts on the ground. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=696.92s)]
*  Donald Trump, a couple of weeks ago, announced [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=699.3199999999999s)]
*  that he's come to an understanding with the Houthis [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=702.68s)]
*  that they will not be attacking American ships anymore [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=705.6s)]
*  and we will not be bombing Yemen anymore. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=708.52s)]
*  And then after that, of course, as we talked about last episode, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=710.8s)]
*  Steve Witkoff was able to negotiate without giving anything in return [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=714.3199999999999s)]
*  the release of the last US citizen who was being held by Hamas. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=719.04s)]
*  And already you can see Ben Shapiro's pissed off. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=724.52s)]
*  This is a bad thing to him. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=730.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm not like adding anything clearly. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=731.88s)]
*  He's upset about this. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=733.6s)]
*  I don't think it's that crazy. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=735.52s)]
*  You could you could take any clip of our show and you could tell [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=736.6s)]
*  when I'm generally pleased or generally displeased [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  by something going on in the news. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=743.24s)]
*  This is Ben Shapiro being pissed off. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=745.04s)]
*  Just think about that for a second. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=748.0s)]
*  These are unequivocally positive outcomes. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=750.36s)]
*  This is what everybody should be happy about. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=755.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, OK, they're not going to attack Americans. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=757.88s)]
*  Americans aren't going to attack them. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=759.56s)]
*  OK, these guys were holding an American citizen. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=760.92s)]
*  Now they are no longer holding an American citizen. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=763.12s)]
*  This is a positive. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=765.48s)]
*  And yet Ben Shapiro is pissed off. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=767.24s)]
*  Now, why is he pissed off? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, he's already telling you in his own words that it's because [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=771.44s)]
*  this is a way for the Houthis and Hamas to win favor with America [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  and to maybe not, you know, put some distance between America's [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=780.76s)]
*  necessity to be involved in this conflict. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=784.6800000000001s)]
*  And that, you know, I mean, he's saying that's the reason they're doing it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=787.5200000000001s)]
*  He hasn't presented any evidence. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=791.92s)]
*  I don't know that it is. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=793.16s)]
*  But that might allow negotiations with Iran to proceed positively. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=794.0799999999999s)]
*  So if you're like. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=801.76s)]
*  Look, I think it's it's fairly reasonable to say [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=804.24s)]
*  that if you're in a state with [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=808.28s)]
*  like, let's say there's the threat of war is on the table. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=811.76s)]
*  Like you might go to war with this government and you're in negotiations [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=816.56s)]
*  with them to see if that war can be avoided. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=820.52s)]
*  Who the hell is not rooting for the negotiations to be successful? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  Who would prefer that this ends in war? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=830.88s)]
*  That's like a crazy starting place. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=835.0s)]
*  And yet that is Ben Shapiro's perspective. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=836.96s)]
*  I just find this to be kind of wild. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=840.8s)]
*  Any any thoughts on this, Rob? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=842.48s)]
*  I think they're just trying to sell it however they can, because, you know, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=844.4s)]
*  Israel does a good job of provoking a fight if we're going to be there to back them. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=848.56s)]
*  That's they're they're looking for us to be involved in the Iran War. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  And so the fact that we've, you know, I guess [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=856.1999999999999s)]
*  the Iran War would be our war, it wouldn't be Israel's war. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=860.8s)]
*  So if the big claim is Iran's got all these terrorists in the region [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=863.8s)]
*  and that's why they can't be negotiated with. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=867.04s)]
*  And I guess we've dealt with that problem of having conversations [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=868.84s)]
*  with these terrorists and figured out how to not have their interests [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=872.84s)]
*  actually get in the way of the American interest. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=876.36s)]
*  That's very upsetting to Ben Shapiro that we've created a platform [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=879.4s)]
*  by which you can actually have a conversation with Iran [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  because their sponsoring of terrorism in the region is no longer a deal breaker [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=885.44s)]
*  for the U.S. having a direct conversation with Iran. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=890.08s)]
*  It sounds like he much prefers the framework of Israel's our number one ally [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=893.08s)]
*  and they need to be trusted. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  And so they should be just handling all of this within the region [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=899.24s)]
*  with America's backing. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=902.44s)]
*  He prefers that framework of Israel deal with it [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=904.28s)]
*  and America will back whatever it is that Israel would like. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=906.52s)]
*  But America first is no, why is Israel going to dictate the terms for America, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=909.52s)]
*  particularly if you're putting our backing on the line? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=914.12s)]
*  So it just sounds to me like he's [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=917.36s)]
*  he's complaining about the exact framework that we're saying is a good shift. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=919.6s)]
*  And he's going, this is horrible and despicable [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=923.16s)]
*  that Donald Trump would step in and want to deal with these with these people directly. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=926.04s)]
*  Yep. All right. Let's keep playing. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=931.4s)]
*  America can do so in Israel. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=934.24s)]
*  There are plenty of places that he, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=937.88s)]
*  Don Alexander and his family can express their gratitude to President Trump [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=939.12s)]
*  as well as they should. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=942.16s)]
*  Going to Qatar to meet the Emir of Qatar, Qatar is a terror sponsor country. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=943.84s)]
*  Qatar is the number one funder of Hamas. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=948.76s)]
*  It is disgusting to have a hostage who is taken by a group funded by Qatar. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=951.44s)]
*  Go to Qatar to thank the Emir of Qatar for his freedom. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=957.2s)]
*  That's that's it's an absurdity on its face. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=962.36s)]
*  If it were to happen, can we just pause for a second? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=964.48s)]
*  All right. Well, you all should not be. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=966.8000000000001s)]
*  I'd love to know if Qatar is the number one sponsor of terrorism in Hamas. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=969.16s)]
*  Why aren't we bombing? Why isn't Israel bombing them? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=975.44s)]
*  Why aren't they inserting influence there? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=978.24s)]
*  I mean, if you're telling me that that's the number one thing [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=980.16s)]
*  and they're the ones who are able to negotiate these deals, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=982.64s)]
*  why aren't you going after the Hamas leadership that's got all the money? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=986.04s)]
*  Yeah. Well, by the way, if you're if you're disgusted at Qatar [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=990.0s)]
*  for funding Hamas, wouldn't you also have to be disgusted [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=994.9599999999999s)]
*  at Benjamin Netanyahu for insisting that they continue that support for years? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=999.56s)]
*  It's unbelievable to me how anybody defending [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1006.16s)]
*  the Israeli government can get away with this shit. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1009.68s)]
*  I mean, listen, again, this is widely reported. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1012.28s)]
*  It is not something that like we are just making up [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1015.68s)]
*  or it's not something that like we're even saying, hey, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1018.6s)]
*  our guys have like a good source on this. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1022.12s)]
*  This is reported in the in the Jerusalem Post, in the Times of Israel [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1025.1200000000001s)]
*  and Haaretz in the New York Times, in the Washington Post. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1028.4s)]
*  According to the defense minister of Israel, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1031.44s)]
*  the quote he used was that Israel quote [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1037.56s)]
*  begged Qatar to continue the funding to Hamas. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1041.2s)]
*  In fact, just a couple of weeks before October 7th, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1045.52s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu sent the head of Mossad to Qatar [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1048.68s)]
*  to ensure that the funding continues. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1052.24s)]
*  And also, yes, Qatar is an ally of the United States of America. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1054.48s)]
*  They may not technically be called an ally of Israel, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1058.16s)]
*  but they certainly have a close working relationship with them. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1060.56s)]
*  So the idea that we're supposed to now be so appalled [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1063.6s)]
*  that this guy whose life [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1067.08s)]
*  Donald Trump just saved, that he's going to Qatar [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1070.04s)]
*  to to meet with Donald Trump, it's just like as if this is the real [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1073.8799999999999s)]
*  moral outrage rather than like there's lots of moral [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1078.6799999999998s)]
*  outrages you could find here, Rob, right. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1083.24s)]
*  But like, why isn't it? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1085.56s)]
*  Look, if all Witkoff had to do [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1087.8799999999999s)]
*  was say, listen, return the last US hostage [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1092.8s)]
*  and this will really gain favor for you, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1096.76s)]
*  I would think the moral outrage would be like, how has this not been done sooner? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1099.28s)]
*  I mean, even within within within the Trump administration, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1103.84s)]
*  forget me trying to put this on the last administration, say, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1106.6799999999998s)]
*  why did it take 100 days? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, geez, weren't you guys like, you know, you negotiated a ceasefire [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1110.9599999999998s)]
*  in phase one, 20 of the hostages were released. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1114.6799999999998s)]
*  How come the American wasn't prioritized on this list? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1119.0s)]
*  Like, why don't we make sure we could get him? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1122.6399999999999s)]
*  It seems pretty clear in hindsight that you could have gotten them. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1124.1599999999999s)]
*  They were willing to give them up. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1127.56s)]
*  Now, I'm not even making that argument, because, as I said on the last show, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1129.28s)]
*  I think it's, you know, listen, it's terrible. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1132.56s)]
*  All hostages being held are terrible. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1135.24s)]
*  All all deaths are terrible, even deaths of soldiers. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  But he was active duty and he was taken in an IDF uniform. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1141.52s)]
*  That's just a little bit different. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1145.32s)]
*  You're not like it's not the same thing as just you're an American citizen [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1146.44s)]
*  on vacation, like you were in a war zone on one side of that war. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1149.84s)]
*  However, that's where you could look if you wanted to find an outrage. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1154.2s)]
*  But the outrage is what now that he's free, he's going to Qatar. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1158.84s)]
*  Why isn't it an outrage when the Mossad goes to Qatar? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1162.56s)]
*  And when Israeli leaders go to Qatar? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1165.6399999999999s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1167.84s)]
*  Also, it's just, you know, in the in the general context of all of the babies [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1170.04s)]
*  who are dying, you'd think that would be a little bit more of a moral outrage. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1174.84s)]
*  But I suppose it's not. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1177.8s)]
*  Also, if someone from is a cutter or a guitar, I don't even know. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1179.6399999999999s)]
*  Cutter is closer to being correct, unless you want to say it like [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1184.3999999999999s)]
*  unless you want to do it, Ben Shapiro does or what, like everyone does [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1188.0s)]
*  on cable news when a Latino name comes up and you have to say it [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1191.72s)]
*  in the Latino accent, if you're going to do that thing, cutter, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1194.64s)]
*  I think is closer than Qatar, but either is fine. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1198.04s)]
*  And what would be the Arabic accent for Qatar? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1200.32s)]
*  I think when Ben Shapiro says, oh, there you go. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm guttural. You can just call it that. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1209.16s)]
*  I would think if someone from Qatar [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1211.44s)]
*  was able to navigate this deal with Hamas and they just got you released, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1214.4s)]
*  don't you almost have a moral duty to sit down and make a plea for the other ones? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1220.04s)]
*  And I would just think if you're interested in getting everyone else out [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1224.08s)]
*  and someone seems to have that kind of pull on Hamas, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1227.32s)]
*  I mean, the bombing innocent civilians in Gaza doesn't seem to be the working [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1231.2s)]
*  strategy for getting people released. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1235.3600000000001s)]
*  I would personally like to have as much information on who the cutter team is [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1237.44s)]
*  that exerts influence over Gaza. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1241.0s)]
*  And even if you want to go the other way of, well, we're going to seize their assets, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1243.16s)]
*  we're going to go to war with Qatar, we're going to cut like I. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1246.4s)]
*  Even that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1249.24s)]
*  But I would just want as much information over who's actually pulling the strings [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1250.4s)]
*  and has the influence over there. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1253.96s)]
*  And if this guy just got released and he can meet with the guy [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1255.72s)]
*  who made it happen and maybe make a plea for other people, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1257.92s)]
*  that seems like a missed opportunity to go, you know, fuck the guy that got me released. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1260.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But again, though, this is kind of my point. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1265.5600000000002s)]
*  It is a very good point. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1267.68s)]
*  But this is kind of like what I'm getting at with all of this. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1268.64s)]
*  It's like, look, you can tell by someone's. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1270.76s)]
*  Like. I don't know exactly how to say this, but you could if somebody is sitting [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1275.6s)]
*  there and going like, this is just amazing, I'm overjoyed that this guy's life has been saved. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1280.0s)]
*  What an amazing thing the Trump administration did. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1284.1999999999998s)]
*  You know, I'd kind of prefer they weren't meeting in Qatar. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1286.52s)]
*  I wish they were meeting in Tel Aviv, but, you know, whatever, it's pretty great. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1289.08s)]
*  Is it like if that were the tone, there would really be nothing to talk about. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1292.36s)]
*  But when you're furious about the whole thing and you're just morally outraged [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1296.24s)]
*  and then your real issue here is clearly that like, look, it's just so obvious here. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1301.64s)]
*  What's the real issue? Well, now, Rob negotiations with Iran might proceed. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1306.92s)]
*  Negotiations with Hamas might proceed. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1312.6000000000001s)]
*  And then there's really no need for America to back up Israel's war anymore. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1314.92s)]
*  That's really the problem here. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1319.48s)]
*  And so you're really kind of pissed off because it's like all of this was just an excuse [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1321.4s)]
*  for you to keep leveling Gaza and to ultimately take it and annex the whole thing and ethnically [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1326.68s)]
*  cleanse the Gazans out of there. That seems to be what you're upset about. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1331.72s)]
*  And that's pretty damn sickening. Here, let's keep playing. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1337.3999999999999s)]
*  Facilitated by the United States, Qatar is the sponsor state of Hamas. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1342.6s)]
*  In fact, if the Trump administration seriously wanted all hostages out of Gaza, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1347.8799999999999s)]
*  they could do so tomorrow simply by telling the Emir of Qatar that the air base in Qatar [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1351.56s)]
*  is going away and that it'll move to the UAE, which the United States could do. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1355.4s)]
*  That should have been the approach of the Biden administration on October 8th. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1359.88s)]
*  They should have said all the hostages come out or the air base goes away. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1362.68s)]
*  That's how closely tied together Qatar and Hamas are. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1365.16s)]
*  Lay down. Alexander is now 21. Hamas captured him when he was 19 on October 7th, 2023, of course. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1369.96s)]
*  All of this has some wider ramifications with regard to negotiations in the Middle East. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1376.68s)]
*  Again, Steve Witkoff continues to say ridiculous things publicly. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1381.24s)]
*  So Steve Witkoff, again, I do not think he's a good negotiator. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1385.64s)]
*  I do not think that Steve Witkoff has demonstrated his bona fides along any lines. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1388.44s)]
*  So far, all of the hostage deals have essentially been kind of mediocre in the sense that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1391.88s)]
*  maximum pressure has not been exerted on the bad guys. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1399.4s)]
*  Yesterday, Witkoff said, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1402.36s)]
*  Which is a positive for a second. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1403.64s)]
*  Doesn't this just say everything about who's who and what side everyone's on? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1406.9199999999998s)]
*  Sitting here, I'm supposed to be the, well, I think as I've been called by a lot of these [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1412.6s)]
*  Ziobots on Twitter that I'm taking some type of Qatari money or something like that. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1418.4399999999998s)]
*  We're all so, and we're just sitting here. We're like, yeah, no screw cutter, screw Israel, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1423.1599999999999s)]
*  screw Hamas, whatever. But hey, it's pretty wonderful that [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1427.8799999999999s)]
*  Witkoff's gotten 21 of these hostages out. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1433.24s)]
*  You know, for all the debates I've done on this subject and how much people try to like [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1435.8s)]
*  morally lecture you about what about the hostages? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1439.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm the one celebrating when they get released. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1443.08s)]
*  And Ben Shapiro is furious about it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1445.9599999999998s)]
*  He's attacking Witkoff who's saying all types of crazy things, Rob. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1448.36s)]
*  What are the crazy things? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, Ben Shapiro didn't let you know. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1454.52s)]
*  By the way, that's always a pretty good tell. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1456.84s)]
*  And someone goes, oh, this guy's saying all types of crazy shit, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1458.84s)]
*  but I'm not going to tell you what any of the crazy shit he's saying. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1460.92s)]
*  Because you know what the crazy shit is? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1463.3200000000002s)]
*  He goes, man, there's all these war hawks in our government who just want the war to keep going. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1464.8400000000001s)]
*  Man, Israel just seems committed to continuing this war. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1470.2s)]
*  That's the crazy shit that Witkoff has said. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1473.5600000000002s)]
*  That's what Ben Shapiro is talking about. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1475.5600000000002s)]
*  That he's called out the neocons and the Israeli government for seeming to just want war. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1477.24s)]
*  That's the crazy shit. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1484.6000000000001s)]
*  And he's not, he doesn't really know what his bona fides are. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1485.5600000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1488.28s)]
*  Like, what makes this guy such a good negotiator? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1489.4s)]
*  He goes, oh, well, I guess the 21 hostages whose lives he saved. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1492.92s)]
*  That seems like pretty good outcome to me. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1496.6s)]
*  This thing was going on for how long before Donald Trump took office? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1498.84s)]
*  A full year, a year and three months, a year and four months before Donald Trump came in. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1504.68s)]
*  None of this progress was made before Witkoff got on the scene. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1510.6s)]
*  And there's 21 hostages whose lives have been saved since then. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1514.44s)]
*  Plus, you know, don't get me wrong, Israel broke the ceasefire and then started slaughtering [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1518.12s)]
*  people in Gaza again. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1522.9199999999998s)]
*  But there was at least a little bit of a period there where they had a ceasefire going. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1524.04s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1528.28s)]

*  All right. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1590.76s)]
*  Let's get back into the show. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1591.08s)]
*  It's also interesting to hear that if the US were to exert influence over Qatar, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1592.76s)]
*  the hostages could have been released by the next day. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1598.9199999999998s)]
*  And yet I don't think I've ever heard that request from Netanyahu. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1602.28s)]
*  I've heard a lot of requests for more bombs. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1605.32s)]
*  But I wasn't even aware that, you know, I guess the war hawks were aware of a secondary strategy [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1608.28s)]
*  of exerting influence over Qatar. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1614.6799999999998s)]
*  It's something that I was saying, I think, at the outset of this of go after the actual leadership. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1616.36s)]
*  But apparently, there is a way to financially, according to Ben Shapiro, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1621.8799999999999s)]
*  financially exert pressure over Hamas leadership in Qatar. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1626.28s)]
*  As to why Israel and America, or Israel hasn't applied pressure on America to go that route, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1631.0s)]
*  I guess speaks to the needless killing of civilians in Gaza. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1637.64s)]
*  Or why hasn't Israel gone that route? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1641.4s)]
*  You had a close enough relationship with them that you could persuade them to continue pouring in [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1643.96s)]
*  briefcases full of cash to Hamas. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1648.84s)]
*  I hear constantly yelling about Qatar, the same as Iran, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1650.76s)]
*  of Iran's the state sponsor of terrorism in the region. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1653.56s)]
*  I don't seem to hear a lot of chatter. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1656.52s)]
*  Now we're starting to. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1657.56s)]
*  Kiddamming Qatar. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1658.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's all all fair questions. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1660.28s)]
*  All right, let's keep playing. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1662.84s)]
*  Not willing to end the war. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1667.56s)]
*  Israel is prolonging it despite the fact that we don't see where else we can go. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1669.08s)]
*  And then an agreement must be reached. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1672.68s)]
*  There's currently an opportunity window. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1674.1200000000001s)]
*  We hope Israel and all the mediators will take advantage of. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1675.4s)]
*  We're putting pressure on all the mediators and doing everything we can to bring the hostages home. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1677.4s)]
*  It's not Israel's unwillingness to end the war that is leading to hostages being taken. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1681.08s)]
*  That's like blaming the police for the kidnappers not releasing the hostages. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1685.48s)]
*  No, actually, that's up to the kidnappers. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1690.2s)]
*  Come on, let's pause it right there. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1692.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay, so now Ben Shapiro embraces my analogy of the police coming to try to get some hostages out. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1695.08s)]
*  Again, the problem Ben Shapiro is going to have is he goes, look, this is as ridiculous [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1705.24s)]
*  as blaming the police for hostages not being released. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1710.3600000000001s)]
*  And it's like, well, yes, if instead of negotiating, the police came in and just [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1714.44s)]
*  started blowing up buildings because hostages were taken and killing a whole bunch of innocent people, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1720.6000000000001s)]
*  I do think in fact, we would blame the police. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1726.28s)]
*  That makes perfect sense. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1729.3200000000002s)]
*  And no, it is not the case that because there's a crime and then because the police get called, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1731.0800000000002s)]
*  that now it would be crazy to blame the police for any of their behavior. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1739.0s)]
*  The police don't just get a get out of jail free card because they were called, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1743.5600000000002s)]
*  their actions are going to be evaluated as well. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1749.24s)]
*  And again, the negotiations have been very tangibly successful. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1753.16s)]
*  They haven't been successful in terms of ending the war, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1758.92s)]
*  but they have been successful in terms of getting of retrieving hostages. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1761.4s)]
*  So this whole thing is just so utterly ridiculous. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1765.16s)]
*  Yeah, the police are also actors and they also have responsibility. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1768.44s)]
*  And if someone, if police got called to a scene because there was like a domestic [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1774.12s)]
*  violence report or something, and then they killed a bunch of innocent people when they got there, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1778.2s)]
*  yes, we would blame the police. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1782.76s)]
*  And it doesn't follow that all of this is on whoever the criminal was who initially [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1784.36s)]
*  resulted in the police call. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1788.76s)]
*  Even within this analogy, what Ben Shapiro is saying makes no sense. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1790.44s)]
*  All right, let's keep playing. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1795.1599999999999s)]
*  Ended the war October 6th. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1797.56s)]
*  It never had to happen in the first place. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1802.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, all of this is part and parcel of broader negotiations [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1805.1599999999999s)]
*  happening over the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1808.04s)]
*  According to the Wall Street Journal, the United States said it was encouraged by talks [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1809.8s)]
*  with Iran on Sunday after a meeting, but the two sides remain divided on key questions, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1813.32s)]
*  including whether Tehran will be allowed to enrich its own uranium. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1817.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, that is the key question. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1820.44s)]
*  That is not one key question. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1822.28s)]
*  That is the key question. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1823.3999999999999s)]
*  United States should have no interest in a deal with Iran where Iran continues to develop [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1825.0800000000002s)]
*  nuclear missiles. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1829.0s)]
*  That is ridiculous. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1830.28s)]
*  Anything that allows them the capacity to continue to develop nuclear materials, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1831.48s)]
*  which can then be tied to their ballistic missile program, is insane. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1834.8400000000001s)]
*  The United States should not be party to that. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1838.28s)]
*  That is the JCPOA. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1840.28s)]
*  That is the thing that that Donald Trump labeled the worst deal in history. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1841.64s)]
*  United States should not be conceding points to the Iranian government. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1845.4s)]
*  Again, Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Arahi met for three hours in the Omani [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1849.5600000000002s)]
*  capital of Muscat in their fourth round of negotiations since April 12. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1854.28s)]
*  After the meeting, the U.S. cast the latest talks mediated by Omani officials as positive [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1859.32s)]
*  and said the diplomacy would continue in the near future. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1863.08s)]
*  Iran's foreign ministry spokesman said talks were difficult but useful in better understanding [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1865.72s)]
*  the U.S. position. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1869.48s)]
*  Now, again, Iran has another goal in these talks if they can't get a bad deal from the [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1870.28s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1874.36s)]
*  And again, I have faith that President Trump is not going to cut JCPOA Part 2. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1875.24s)]
*  It would be a rejection of his own legacy. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1879.08s)]
*  If Iran has another goal, it is delay. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1881.48s)]
*  A delay for Iran is as good as a deal. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1884.44s)]
*  In October, the JCPOA period ends. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1889.16s)]
*  At that point, they can simply rush to a bomb. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1893.0s)]
*  Now, they could just rush to a bomb right now as well. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1895.16s)]
*  They can simply violate whatever is left of the JCPOA and they could rush to a bomb. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1897.0s)]
*  Herein lies the problem. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1902.68s)]
*  Right now, there is a window of opportunity for anyone who wishes to end the Iranian nuclear [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1903.8s)]
*  program. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1907.6399999999999s)]
*  That window of opportunity exists because Israel eviscerated a few months back Iran's [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1908.84s)]
*  entire air defense program. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1912.84s)]
*  So the skies over Iran are totally clear right now. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1914.9199999999998s)]
*  Not only that, but Iran still has not developed retaliatory capacity that would deter action [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1918.84s)]
*  by, say, Israel. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1924.28s)]
*  If Iran is capable of standing the Israelis down by negotiating with the United States [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1926.4399999999998s)]
*  for prolonged periods of time, that is their win. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1930.4399999999998s)]
*  Simply the negotiations being dragged out over a lengthy period of time is something [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1933.24s)]
*  the Iranians are going for pretty clearly. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1937.1599999999999s)]
*  The two sides are still very far apart on the question of whether Iran gets to retain [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1940.1200000000001s)]
*  its nuclear enrichment program. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1944.2800000000002s)]
*  Witkoff has sent mixed messages himself because he has no expertise in any of these issues. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1946.92s)]
*  He set out what he called clear U.S. red lines that Iran can't have an enrichment program [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1951.8000000000002s)]
*  under a deal nor should have any centrifuges which enrich uranium. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1955.0800000000002s)]
*  And then Iran came back and said they would never accept any such terms. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1958.8400000000001s)]
*  President Masoud Peshakian, who again is a stand in for the mullahs, said Iran has never [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1963.24s)]
*  sought and will never seek nuclear weapons, but it will not back down from its peaceful [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1968.2s)]
*  nuclear rights. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1971.16s)]
*  After Sunday's talk, Araki said Iran was open to adjusting the amount of enrichment it does [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1972.2800000000002s)]
*  and the purity of the material being produced for a limited period as a confidence building [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1976.0400000000002s)]
*  measure. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1979.72s)]
*  But he said there is no room for discussion about Iran's continued domestic enrichment. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1980.68s)]
*  So what exactly is Iran giving away that makes Steve Witkoff and company optimistic in any way? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1985.16s)]
*  Again, this is just what Iran can delay. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1992.2800000000002s)]
*  And if President Trump doesn't want to bomb Iran, which again he has set out as sort of [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1994.68s)]
*  binary, there is a third option here, by the way, which is that the United States maintains [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=1997.64s)]
*  maximum pressure on Iran and then Israel goes and attacks the Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2001.5600000000002s)]
*  I think that is actually the most likely outcome here if I'm just gaming out the possibilities [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2006.68s)]
*  for the next several months. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2010.6000000000001s)]
*  Let's pause it. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2012.6000000000001s)]
*  With all of that said. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2013.16s)]
*  Is it not crazy how much these guys love war that it's just like negotiating? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2015.88s)]
*  All sides of the negotiation are saying, hey, they're going pretty good. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2022.44s)]
*  And this is a real problem. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2026.04s)]
*  Because how do we get to war at the end of this? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2027.8s)]
*  And again, all of this stuff about like there's so many just [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2031.3999999999999s)]
*  assumptions built into this line of argument. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2038.2s)]
*  Like you're just supposed to accept that Iran developing a nuclear weapon would be the worst [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2041.32s)]
*  thing in the world, that that can't possibly be allowed to happen. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2047.8799999999999s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2052.52s)]
*  Like, you know, look, I'm not saying I don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon personally. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2053.8s)]
*  I'd like to see less of them. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2058.76s)]
*  Nuclear weapons are dangerous, you know? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2060.36s)]
*  But like India and Pakistan both have nuclear weapons. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2062.44s)]
*  They're in the middle of a conflict right now. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2065.6400000000003s)]
*  The only country that I'm aware of that has nuclear weapons that lies and pretends they [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2067.5600000000004s)]
*  doesn't is Israel. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2072.52s)]
*  They're the only ones who somehow are able to get away with just claiming they don't so [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2075.5600000000004s)]
*  that they don't have to meet any of the legal requirements. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2080.1200000000003s)]
*  No other country that I'm aware of is able to do that. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2082.7599999999998s)]
*  But I think, you know, it's funny because obviously, as many people may know, right, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2086.12s)]
*  like officially Benjamin Netanyahu testified in 2002 that the US should overthrow the mullahs [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2092.3599999999997s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2099.64s)]
*  Israel has been for a regime change there this entire time. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2101.56s)]
*  They're always attempting to create this sense of urgency. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2105.96s)]
*  Like this war has to happen right now. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2111.72s)]
*  And they've gone through a bunch of different bullshit lies over the years of how, you know, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2114.2s)]
*  famously, I'm sure most people remember we've talked about it a lot when Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2118.04s)]
*  went to the UN with his Daffy Duck bomb and said they're all the way here. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2122.52s)]
*  They're five years away. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2127.24s)]
*  They've been five years away since I was a kid from getting a nuclear weapon. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2128.6s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu himself has said Israel is five years away from a nuke in the 90s in 2002. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2132.6s)]
*  He said it again in 2011. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2140.76s)]
*  He said it again just five years away, five years away. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2142.92s)]
*  Then when Obama signed the Iran deal, which they were just referring to, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2145.7200000000003s)]
*  he said Benjamin Netanyahu said now that put them on the fast track toward a nuclear bomb. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2151.88s)]
*  So I guess from five years down to, I don't know, what, four, three years, they're on a [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2157.0s)]
*  fast track now. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2162.6800000000003s)]
*  All this time later, everybody acknowledges they still don't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2164.0400000000004s)]
*  But we're supposed to pretend that their civilian nuclear program is this huge threat [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2167.88s)]
*  because as Ben Shapiro says, which I think he's actually correct about this, they could go for [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2172.6000000000004s)]
*  a nuclear weapon at any time. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2176.36s)]
*  They could do it now. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2178.92s)]
*  They could do it later. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2179.5600000000004s)]
*  I think the real issue here is that everyone would know if they actually were going for a [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2180.92s)]
*  nuclear weapon. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2184.84s)]
*  But regardless of that, why is it such a given that this must be a priority for the United [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2185.48s)]
*  States of America? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2192.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, the idea that what they used to say, and they used to say this about North Korea, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2193.8s)]
*  and they used to say it about Iran too. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2201.24s)]
*  This was like the propaganda right after 9-11 was that, listen, a lot of countries have [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2202.92s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2210.28s)]
*  We've lived in a nuclear world now since World War II. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2212.44s)]
*  Of course, the only country who's ever used nukes against people was the United States [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2216.52s)]
*  of America at the end of World War II. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2220.6s)]
*  But what happened after that is the Russians developed them. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2224.04s)]
*  And then we lived in this world of mutually assured destruction. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2227.64s)]
*  And so no one's using nukes now because we know if you use them, the other side's going to use [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2232.2s)]
*  them, we're all going to end up dead. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2236.52s)]
*  So we can't do that. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2237.7999999999997s)]
*  However, there are these regimes like North Korea and Iran, and they are so suicidal that they [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2239.16s)]
*  don't care about mutually assured destruction. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2247.16s)]
*  If they get nukes, they'll just start nuking people because they're like religious fanatics [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2249.72s)]
*  and they don't care about whether they get killed too. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2253.7999999999997s)]
*  So we can't allow them to have nukes. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2255.9599999999996s)]
*  After that, North Korea developed nukes and has still never used them. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2258.3599999999997s)]
*  Iran, I guess somewhere implicit in this argument is that they are still so goddamn crazy that they [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2262.2799999999997s)]
*  would use nukes if they had them. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2268.68s)]
*  The problem is that if Iran was interested in committing suicide in order to kill some people, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2270.6s)]
*  they certainly could do that right now. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2277.56s)]
*  And yet they're not. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2280.6s)]
*  And yet at every turn, the way that Iran has behaved has totally undermined this claim [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2282.12s)]
*  that they, unlike everybody else, they're so uniquely evil and crazy that they don't [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2290.36s)]
*  care about their own survival. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2296.04s)]
*  Like if that were the case, why did they give the US a heads up before they flew those missiles [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2298.04s)]
*  at Israel last year? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2303.2400000000002s)]
*  Like they've got, why are they negotiating right now? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2305.32s)]
*  None of this makes any sense. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2309.4s)]
*  If the view is that Iran are so like, they're just so insane and they're such religious [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2311.08s)]
*  zealots, they don't care about their own survival. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2320.28s)]
*  They just want to do damage. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2322.04s)]
*  Why are they even negotiating about this? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2323.56s)]
*  Why aren't they, as Ben Shapiro points out, racing to get a nuclear weapon right now and [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2325.96s)]
*  then using it aggressively? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2330.6s)]
*  What is constraining them from doing all of that if the underlying assumption is true? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2332.9199999999996s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be any real argument there. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2340.8399999999997s)]
*  And like, again, look, and I think this is part of the thing that gets so infuriating [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2343.48s)]
*  about these like Israel, Israel firsters is that it's like, look, number one, it's very [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2349.24s)]
*  clear that Ben Shapiro is motivated by what's best for Israel or what he thinks is best [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2356.04s)]
*  for Israel and not by what's best for the United States of America. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2360.68s)]
*  By the way, Rob, I should read there's an old Ben Shapiro tweet that's been recirculating [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2364.6s)]
*  from 2011. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2369.3999999999996s)]
*  This is Ben Shapiro tweeted, I would gladly waive the born in USA requirement for president [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2371.24s)]
*  for BB. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2378.04s)]
*  It's on record saying Netanyahu should be the president of the United States of America. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2381.08s)]
*  This is who this guy is. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2384.68s)]
*  It's who he's always been. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2385.56s)]
*  You know, some people here may object to that, that idea. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2387.56s)]
*  But you're sitting here and you're going, look, okay, well, you know what might have [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2393.0s)]
*  to happen if America is not willing to join in this war, then maybe Israel is just going [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2399.72s)]
*  to have to go at it themselves. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2403.7999999999997s)]
*  They're going to have to. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2405.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2406.6s)]
*  As you guys all well know, when Israel, they, you know, what happened was Israel, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2408.2s)]
*  like it was, I think it was a drone bomb attack, but they killed an Iranian in Syria [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2415.2400000000002s)]
*  at an Iranian console. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2421.1600000000003s)]
*  And then as a response to that, Iran sent some missiles to it at Israel, gave the US [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2423.1600000000003s)]
*  for warning of this. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2430.28s)]
*  And then a team of nations, the United States of America, the UK, Jordan, Saudi Arabia. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2431.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I think Egypt wasn't, I can't remember if Egypt was involved. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2441.7999999999997s)]
*  Definitely Jordan and Saudi Arabia. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2444.44s)]
*  They all came together to protect Israel and shoot down as many of these rockets as they could. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2446.2s)]
*  All I'm saying is like, if you want to have it, this like, we're going to attack this [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2453.16s)]
*  country and we don't even need you. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2456.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like, okay, fine. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2458.52s)]
*  But then don't be asking for our defense as you surely will be when the missiles come [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2459.64s)]
*  firing back at you because sorry, not that any of this is perfect, but this is the way [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2464.92s)]
*  the world works. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2470.2s)]
*  You fire missiles at a country, they may fire some missiles back at you. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2471.24s)]
*  And so if you're not in a position to defend yourself, don't go out, you can't, then you [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2475.3999999999996s)]
*  can't turn around and start talking tough. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2480.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, well, if you won't do it, then I'm just going to do it. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2482.3599999999997s)]
*  It's just, it's infuriating. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2486.12s)]
*  Anyways, it seems like a very convenient storyline of now is the only opportunity for us to [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2489.56s)]
*  strike their nuclear facilities. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2496.68s)]
*  If we strike the nuclear facilities at this point in time, there will be nothing that [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2498.68s)]
*  they can do back to us. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2502.9199999999996s)]
*  And if we don't do it right now, then they will have a nuclear bomb in the future. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2504.44s)]
*  And if that intelligence is true, then go do it. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2508.7599999999998s)]
*  And you know why? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2513.48s)]
*  I'm going to guess that that's not true. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2514.6s)]
*  I'm going to guess every piece of that information is not true, that they that you get a free [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2516.2799999999997s)]
*  ride to attack it, that they can't attack back and that that you can actually permanently [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2520.6s)]
*  ruin their ability to get the bomb. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2525.3199999999997s)]
*  None of that sounds true. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2527.56s)]
*  If all that is actually true of, hey, this is our one window of opportunity and it's [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2528.68s)]
*  easy for us to do, then just go do it. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2533.64s)]
*  I'm just going to guess that none of that is true. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2537.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2539.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2539.8s)]
*  Well said. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2540.12s)]
*  And by the way, if all that is true, why aren't you guys selling that storyline? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2540.68s)]
*  I mean, if all the intelligence that he just put forward is the current situation of, hey, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2545.96s)]
*  we've got a free shot right now and they will never be able to have a nuclear bomb. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2551.0s)]
*  And this is our one moment and it will be totally free. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2554.36s)]
*  They will not. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2557.7200000000003s)]
*  There will be no retribution if we do so. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2558.28s)]
*  Why isn't that every day on the news? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2561.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, if one piece of this is true, why? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2564.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's an I want to, like, why was there tatter of war? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2566.6800000000003s)]
*  It sounds to me like we don't need a war. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2569.88s)]
*  You need a single strategic strike and that would be the end of it. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2571.1600000000003s)]
*  So why isn't he in America just lobbying for Israel to do a single strategic strike? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2574.36s)]
*  That sounds very sellable. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2578.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2581.56s)]
*  No, it's a fair point. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2581.96s)]
*  Yeah, because that's not actually what they want. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2583.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2586.12s)]
*  Here, let's keep playing. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2586.36s)]
*  All this ties into broader Middle Eastern negotiations that are happening over everything [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2588.68s)]
*  from the Abrahamic cores to the release of hostages to the future of the Gaza Strip [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2592.12s)]
*  to what's happening in Iran. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2595.96s)]
*  Now, all of this crosses paths, obviously, with President Trump's visit to the Middle East [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2597.96s)]
*  this week. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2601.32s)]
*  The biggest story in terms of the media coming out this week is a story reported by ABC News, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2601.8s)]
*  among others, that the Trump administration is now preparing to accept a super luxury [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2608.12s)]
*  Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2613.08s)]
*  It is a four hundred million dollar gift available for use by President Trump as new Air Force [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2617.72s)]
*  One until shortly before he leaves office, at which time, according to the deal, the [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2623.4s)]
*  plane doesn't stay with the United States government. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2627.16s)]
*  It then moves to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2629.16s)]
*  According to ABC News, the gift had been expected to be announced when President Trump was on his [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2633.64s)]
*  visit to Qatar. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2637.8s)]
*  A senior White House official said it's not going to happen in Qatar anymore, presumably [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2639.5600000000004s)]
*  thanks to social media blowback. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2643.0s)]
*  President Trump put out a statement on Truth Social about the blowback, saying, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2645.8s)]
*  So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a gift free of charge with 747 aircraft [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2649.5600000000004s)]
*  to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One temporarily in a very public and transparent [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2653.8s)]
*  transaction so bothers the crooked Democrats, they insist we pay top dollar for the plane. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2657.88s)]
*  Anybody can do that. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2662.04s)]
*  The Dems are world-class losers. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2662.76s)]
*  MAGA. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2664.6800000000003s)]
*  So again, the arrangement itself is, shall we say, I believe the technical term, legal [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2665.64s)]
*  term is skeezy. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2671.3199999999997s)]
*  Sources told ABC News that lawyers for the White House Counsel's Office and the Department of [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2673.72s)]
*  Justice drafted an analysis for the Defense Department, concluding it's legal for the DOD [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2677.56s)]
*  to accept the aircraft as a gift and then later turn it over to the Trump Library and that somehow [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2683.24s)]
*  does not violate laws against bribery or the Constitution's prohibition on emoluments. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2687.4s)]
*  The Constitution literally says the U.S. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2692.84s)]
*  Government cannot accept official gifts from any king, prince, or foreign state. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2695.48s)]
*  Apparently, Attorney General Pam Bondi and the top White House lawyer, David Warrington, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2699.2400000000002s)]
*  concluded it would be legally permissible for the donation of the aircraft to be conditioned [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2703.48s)]
*  on transferring its ownership to Trump's presidential library before the end of his term. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2707.48s)]
*  And apparently, Pam Bondi, who it should be mentioned at this point was once a [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2713.2400000000002s)]
*  national fair registered agent acting on behalf of the government of Qatar, provided a legal [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2717.56s)]
*  memorandum addressed to the White House Counsel's Office last week after Warrington asked her for [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2722.52s)]
*  advice on the legality of the Pentagon accepting such a donation. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2726.52s)]
*  We'll get to more. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2729.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2731.64s)]
*  So, you know, after all this ridiculous kind of cheerleading for war, of course, Ben Shapiro [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2732.6s)]
*  is very outraged about this, the offered gift that the Qataris have offered to buy Donald Trump [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2739.8s)]
*  a plane. Look, we could get into this a little bit here. I will say it is, it's pretty rich. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2747.48s)]
*  It's pretty rich for any of these Israel firsters to have suddenly decided that [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2758.04s)]
*  outside influence on the U.S. Government is a very big problem. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2770.44s)]
*  And of course, only in one direction. And, you know, APAC can say that the A stands for America [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2775.0s)]
*  as much as they want. But like APAC gives tens of millions of dollars to political candidates. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2782.2000000000003s)]
*  They, I think, were the biggest contributor in the last election. They are enormously powerful [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2790.6s)]
*  and influential. There's also, obviously, there are entire organizations like the ADL [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2798.12s)]
*  and the Southern Poverty Law Center that are kind of set up to ruin the life of anybody who's a [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2805.56s)]
*  critic of Israel. So look, I'm kind of with Ben Shapiro in a sense. I don't like stuff like this. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2811.64s)]
*  I don't think the Trump administration should do this. I think it's like, you know, it's [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2820.12s)]
*  particularly the aspect of it being transferred to Trump's library does seem to me to be not okay. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2824.84s)]
*  However, more broadly speaking, it's like the idea as the founders themselves wrote, George [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2832.92s)]
*  Washington spoke about this in his farewell address. It's like, be friends with the world, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2842.92s)]
*  talk with people, negotiate, trade with people, just don't have war guarantees, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2849.48s)]
*  don't get in the middle of these entangling alliances. That to me is a much better step [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2855.0s)]
*  than so like the idea of a foreign government wanting to like give us a gift while I don't [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2860.5200000000004s)]
*  like it if it could at all be considered a bribe, which I do think this could be. And I don't think [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2866.6000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump should accept that. That being said, it's like, you can see where Ben Shapiro is so [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2871.16s)]
*  angered by like, friendly relations to the broader Muslim world by negotiating with the broader [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2878.68s)]
*  Muslim world that really angers him. The idea of another catastrophic war seems to excite him, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2887.3999999999996s)]
*  or seems to be like what this all should end what the end result of all of this should be. And that [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2894.3599999999997s)]
*  to me is fucking nuts. That's really what's nuts. But I don't know, Rob, if you have any [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2900.2s)]
*  thoughts on this Qatari plane. Yeah, my thoughts on the Qatari plan is I don't prefer it. I think [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2904.4399999999996s)]
*  our country spends enough money. If you want to show the grandeur of our country, it makes more [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2912.8399999999997s)]
*  sense that we're able to afford our own plane. It also sounds to me like a bit of a security risk [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2917.24s)]
*  in that if I was the president, I don't think I would want a plane that came from a foreign country. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2923.48s)]
*  So I don't prefer it. And there certainly are the optics of, hey, is there some sort of a favor [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2928.2s)]
*  dealing going on here with it going to the library? I'm getting a little bit bored of myself [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2935.48s)]
*  criticizing everything Trump does. And so amongst all the things that aggravate me, this one's just [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2941.08s)]
*  not like I don't prefer it. I don't think it's better. I don't think it's necessary. I don't [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2947.32s)]
*  think it's good. I don't instantly go, hey, this is the worst example of a government official being [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2953.08s)]
*  bribed and that this is the most horrible thing going on in the country. So I don't prefer it. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2959.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't think it needs that much chatter about, hey, that this is horrible. And I'll be curious [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2964.52s)]
*  to see if he goes through with it. And it just sounds like a security risk. I don't really [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2970.2000000000003s)]
*  understand. Yeah, I had that thought too. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it certainly does. You're like, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2973.88s)]
*  oh, you show you've really checked this thing pretty good, right? Like they didn't hide anything [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2977.96s)]
*  or rig this thing in any way. Yeah. You know, I tend to agree with you about that. Yeah, I don't [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2982.12s)]
*  prefer this. It does. It seems like bad optics to me. I also don't like if the argument is that this [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2988.8399999999997s)]
*  is some type of bribe or something like that, it's like, or some type of quid pro quo. It's like, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=2996.44s)]
*  but what, what exactly do you think they're actually going to get out of Donald Trump that [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3002.04s)]
*  they wouldn't otherwise get because they bought him a nice plane? Like is the idea that like, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3006.04s)]
*  okay, even after Donald, I don't exactly understand. Like, so they're giving it, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3010.92s)]
*  they're not giving it to Donald Trump. They're giving it to his presidential library. But is [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3014.44s)]
*  the idea that Donald Trump could keep flying on this plane? Like after he's out? I mean, I just, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3018.76s)]
*  I think that, you know, Donald Trump is flying on a really nice private plane anytime he flies for [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3023.56s)]
*  the rest of his life. You know what I mean? Like I don't, you know, I mean, I don't, I'm kind of [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3031.56s)]
*  speaking out of my ass here. Like, I don't know enough about this to know, but I can pretty [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3036.84s)]
*  comfortably say that not only will you not bump into Donald Trump at the airport, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3040.92s)]
*  you know, like that's not going to happen for the rest of your life. He won't be flying commercial [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3046.84s)]
*  like the rest of us. I also don't think Donald Trump will ever be on like a kind of crappy private [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3050.52s)]
*  plane. Like I think he'll always be on like the nicest private plane. I think Trump sees it as a [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3056.6000000000004s)]
*  trophy of this is how great and strong I am that other countries want to give us free stuff. And [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3062.6s)]
*  so this is a trophy of I'm going to have the president of the United States of America in [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3069.4s)]
*  his library are going to have this incredible plane because people like me so much. And so he [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3073.3199999999997s)]
*  actually, I think he sees it as positive optics of, look, I just saved the taxpayers $400 million [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3077.88s)]
*  on a plane that we would have needed because people just want to give it to us. And I think [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3083.72s)]
*  you're right. I think that there's like, there's kind of levels of corruption that exist in [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3088.36s)]
*  government. And so for example, if you manage to get your ends on the government for everyone to [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3092.92s)]
*  have to take some vaccine and stay in their house and their lives are going to be ruined, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3098.2000000000003s)]
*  that's really bad. Or if you manage to get an in on the government fund award, the whole bunch of [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3101.08s)]
*  people, and that's really bad. But if you got a kid who goes over somewhere and they want to [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3105.32s)]
*  purchase a hotel for overpriced with a name on it, and they because you know, there's enough other [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3110.76s)]
*  big businesses going on with the oil that it's like a goodwill jet. It's not better. I don't [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3117.4s)]
*  prefer it. But there's just like soft corruption and really bad corruption. And so Donald Trump [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3122.44s)]
*  getting a plane that he sees as a trophy from a foreign country. It's not better. But I don't know [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3128.52s)]
*  how much time do you got to spend upset with it? It's like, well, right, different calculation that [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3134.04s)]
*  it's a trophy. And as well, there's no question you're right about that. I mean, it's clear from [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3138.36s)]
*  his tweet about it, you know, that he likes the like, yeah, I'm very smart. I got $400 million [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3143.16s)]
*  for nothing. The Democrats would have spent $400 million for it. But I'm smart, you know, like, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3148.44s)]
*  yes, obviously, this is what motivates Trump. But yes, but just to on top of what you're saying, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3152.44s)]
*  you're like, if there is some type of corruption or quid pro quo, that is a part of a broader [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3156.92s)]
*  context where we're negotiating our way out of wars, like, I'm sorry, that just does not rise [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3163.08s)]
*  to the top of my outrage list. And there's just so many things to be outraged by. I mean, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3169.64s)]
*  everything, every inch of our federal central government is built on corruption, the whole [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3175.3199999999997s)]
*  goddamn thing. The whole thing is a system rigging the economy against the regular people for the [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3180.92s)]
*  powerful people. I mean, everything dance like the biggest, you know, the biggest portion, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3188.6s)]
*  excluding Medicaid, which is just, you know, not great for a lot of other reasons. But if you look [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3194.28s)]
*  at the biggest budget items in the US government, if you take Medicaid out, it's overwhelmingly like [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3199.88s)]
*  the majority of the budget is defense, Medicare and Social Security. Okay, defense is all just [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3207.0s)]
*  a scheme to transfer money from the American people to weapons companies. Social Security and [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3215.64s)]
*  Medicare is all just a giant transfer of wealth from a poorer group to a wealthier group, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3221.08s)]
*  the boomers, not me, the real boomers. It's like the whole there's so much corruption. But but so [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3228.2799999999997s)]
*  here, this is really what you're exercised about is that before we got into the next disastrous, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3235.24s)]
*  catastrophic war, we went, oh, maybe we could negotiate our way out of it. That's number one, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3242.2s)]
*  what Ben Shapiro's meta, and then one of the negotiating parties wants to buy Donald Trump [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3247.64s)]
*  a really nice gift. That's what you got. That's what really exercises you. And again, you know, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3252.6s)]
*  you could look at this because Ben Shapiro, like I went back to that tweet from 2011, then Shapiro [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3260.2799999999997s)]
*  has a long track record of of this stuff. Then, you know, Ben Shapiro, who supported all of the wars, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3265.4s)]
*  um, never gets this exercise about talking about how incompetent some of the people who said these [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3273.7200000000003s)]
*  wars would be very easy, how incompetent they are. In fact, he'll still probably have all of them on [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3280.76s)]
*  his show and have friendly relations with him. He doesn't get exercised about that. It's wit cough, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3287.0s)]
*  you say, not the architects of Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya and Syria and Somalia and Yemen, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3292.44s)]
*  the war in Ukraine, the current destruction of Gaza. None of that gets him exercised. But wit [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3299.32s)]
*  cough attempting to negotiate because he happened to say at a certain point that like, oh man, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3305.4s)]
*  there really are a bunch of war hawks in our government and just want this war to continue. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3311.08s)]
*  And Israel themselves just want the war to continue. We're trying to negotiate an end to it. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3314.6000000000004s)]
*  That's what exercises Ben Shapiro. And what's, what's beautiful about this is that you can't [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3319.56s)]
*  hide this. Like people read through it and they see like, dude, I've never seen you get this angry [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3326.36s)]
*  about anything else. I'm just saying like you can, I've said this for many years, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3331.08s)]
*  but you can learn a lot about where someone stands politically by what gets like, by what gets them [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3337.48s)]
*  the angriest. It's like, it's an important way to assess people because essentially we all have to [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3345.48s)]
*  have a hierarchy of outrages. And when you don't get that right, you end up getting everything [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3353.16s)]
*  wrong. Look, this was a huge problem, huge, huge, huge problem with like the woke left with like the [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3359.8799999999997s)]
*  the insane progressives of the last few years where they would just have no ability to have [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3366.68s)]
*  like a hierarchy of outrages. So this is why like black lives matter in the middle of black lives [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3371.64s)]
*  matter would just start getting obsessed with like Aunt Jemima being removed from the supermarket. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3378.12s)]
*  And you're like, wait, what? Like even like, forget, listen, I obviously reject a lot of [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3383.72s)]
*  the progressive worldview, but like even by your own stated worldview, like you're saying there [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3387.88s)]
*  are like killer cops who are unaccountable to the citizenry. How are you even talking about Aunt [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3392.52s)]
*  Jemima right now? Like, this is just too ridiculous. It's like, where, where, and, but you see with [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3397.8s)]
*  guys like Ben Shapiro look like all I'm saying is find me the video, please send it to me. I [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3403.8799999999997s)]
*  will play it on the show and I will apologize. Find me the video where Ben Shapiro is this angry [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3410.44s)]
*  about lockdowns. Find me the video where he's this angry about an aggressive military action that [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3416.04s)]
*  ended up being a disaster, just killed a bunch of innocent people and nothing productive came out of [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3423.72s)]
*  it. Find me that example. Find me an example where he's this outraged over vaccine mandates [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3427.64s)]
*  or he's that whatever it is, he's this outraged about anything that actually matters that really [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3433.16s)]
*  destroyed people's lives. No, no, no. What he's outraged about is negotiating and what he's [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3439.3199999999997s)]
*  worried about is that the negotiations might lead to a place where America realizes, oh, we don't, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3446.04s)]
*  we don't need to be involved in a war here. There's simply no reason for us to need that. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3454.6s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is American [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3460.52s)]
*  Financing. Look, we all know we're living in a high price environment and have been for many years. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3464.68s)]
*  For many people, the answer to this is to reach for your credit cards and this is why credit card [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3470.2799999999997s)]
*  debt has been at all time highs. Of course, the problem with credit card debt is that you're [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3474.7599999999998s)]
*  typically paying a very high interest rate. This is where American Financing comes in. They can [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3478.92s)]
*  help homeowners pay off high interest debt by using their home's equity. American Financing is [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3484.12s)]
*  a family owned mortgage lender that's been around for 25 years and they're licensed in all 50 states. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3489.88s)]
*  Their mortgage consultants are salary based, so there's no incentive for them to put you in a [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3495.88s)]
*  loan that doesn't make sense and their customers save an average of $800 a month when they call [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3500.3599999999997s)]
*  and let American Financing help them. You may be able to close in as fast as 10 days and you might [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3506.44s)]

*  your loan in as little as 10 days. Don't let the chaos of the economy get the best of you. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3537.96s)]

*  Dave. All right, let's get back into the show. Now, if you want to argue, which I'm sure is [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3562.92s)]
*  partially the case too, is that Ben Shapiro is just so angry about October 7th that he wants [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3569.08s)]
*  payback for the people who did that and that's the number one priority here. If he sees you [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3578.84s)]
*  being friendly with Qatar, who's friendly with Hamas, or if he sees you being friendly with Iran, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3584.92s)]
*  who's friendly with Hamas, then that's going to infuriate him like, okay, that's fine. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3589.56s)]
*  I've never liked telling anyone they can't have their identity. I understand that, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3595.08s)]
*  but I think you should be honest about that. If you're doing that, then you're not speaking [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3602.12s)]
*  for American conservatives. You're speaking for Israelis and that's okay. You can do that. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3606.92s)]
*  If you really want Benjamin Netanyahu to be your president, you could go to Israel and have that [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3613.96s)]
*  tomorrow. I'm sure Ben Shapiro owns property there and I'm sure he'd be welcomed with open arms, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3618.6s)]
*  but I do think you should be honest about that because it doesn't seem to me that revenge [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3625.88s)]
*  for people killed in a foreign country in a very long ongoing conflict should be the number one [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3633.48s)]
*  motivators for Americans. I think the number one motivator for Americans should be what's in the [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3640.2s)]
*  best interest of the United States of America. That seems fairly reasonable to me. Okay, we're [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3645.4s)]
*  going to wrap up there. Thank you guys very much as always for listening. We will get the members [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3651.0s)]
*  only episode to you, but I'm not sure what time me and Robert are getting into Appleton, so we'll [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3656.84s)]
*  figure that out, but we'll record an episode for you guys out there. Catch you next time. Peace. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfS2YMKXA0&t=3661.4s)]
