# Dave Smith | DOGE Failed, Trump Failed | Part Of The Problem 1268
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg)
*  What's up? What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the Fireburnstein. How are you, sir? How were your weekend of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=12.16s)]
*  shows? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=16.8s)]
*  Oh, we had a fantastic run of porch tours. It was a good time. In the future, not driving [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=17.8s)]
*  down to Virginia Beach on Memorial Day weekend. Look, I'm sort of flustered from that much. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=23.18s)]
*  I learned my lesson. This is a good weekend to take off and actually go on your family [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=28.96s)]
*  vacation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=32.92s)]
*  It's a well you that traffic is probably the worst traffic in the country. That DC traffic [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=33.92s)]
*  is rough. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=42.88s)]
*  I left at noon like thinking I'd clear New York City and etc. And I didn't get over the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=43.88s)]
*  bridge until like 2 p.m. It was a nightmare. But anyways, this weekend I'm out in Texas. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=48.32s)]
*  I got a wild run of porches. I got Austin on Sunday stack line up. Scott Horton is going [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  to be out there Rockport, Texas, San Antonio, Texas. And then I'm out west for about two [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=57.96s)]
*  weeks doing all sorts of shows. You can find them all at PorchTour.com except Vegas wise [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=62.28s)]
*  guys which you can find on their website. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=67.08s)]
*  Hell yeah. Awesome. That sounds great. Happy. Glad you had a good time. Sorry about the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=69.56s)]
*  traffic I got. I'll tell you from the other side of it, doing a family vacation for a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=74.64s)]
*  weekend. You can also hit traffic on that too. It turns out Rob, it's not the traffic [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=81.88s)]
*  doesn't only get you if you're doing comedy shows. It was also that was, you know, something [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=86.44s)]
*  very great. I had a really great nice nice family weekend and I got a lot of stuff coming [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=90.72s)]
*  up. Me and Rob have a lot of stuff together. The next date is June 13th and 14th in Salt [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Lake City at wise guys, one of our favorite clubs. I will be doing some shows without [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Rob here locally in New Jersey at the Comedy Dojo or the Dojo of Comedy, I should say June [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=108.72s)]
*  20th and 21st. I'll be running my new hour over there. If you're in the New York, New [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  Jersey area and you want to come, I know we don't play here as much as we actually play [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  the road ironically. And then we got Denver Comedy Works and Hilarities in Cleveland, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  a lot of our favorite stops. I did want to mention, I know this is a little bit early, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  but I this one, you know, got to let people know my comedy mothership weekend is I'll [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=133.28s)]
*  be headlining there for a weekend in August. This is it's August 22nd, 23rd and 24th. The [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=139.28s)]
*  reason why I try my best to give you guys advance notice is because it's the comedy [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  mothership. All these shows will sell out. So if you want to get tickets, go get them [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=152.08s)]
*  now. There's tickets available for every single show. They just put them up on the website. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=158.08s)]
*  They usually go very fast. So if you want to come see me and me and Austin in August, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=163.4s)]
*  go right now. You can get them at the comedy mothership site or at my site, comicdavismith.com. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  I'll take you over there to their site. Okay, so I literally just made it back home. I apologize. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=175.44s)]
*  We're doing this a little bit later than usual. I literally just rushed in. But so there's, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=183.06s)]
*  you know, a few things going on that I thought would be interesting for us to get into. And [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=189.9s)]
*  maybe even this, this might be the one to start with. Oh, by the way, shout out, shout [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=194.26000000000002s)]
*  out to the fan who brought me this pure misinformation artist shirt, which is what Sam Harris called [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=199.26s)]
*  me on his show. I thought that was pretty funny. So anyway, yeah, I enjoyed it. I'm [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=207.02s)]
*  wearing it. Okay. So one of the things that I've thought was kind of interesting over [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=211.46s)]
*  the last few weeks, I guess this has been, you know, a topic that's that's come up. And [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  I think we did address briefly like some of this on the show, but it has to do with the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=226.22s)]
*  new spending bell, which I guess has made it through the house. Is that is that where [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=231.3s)]
*  it's at right now? Rob? Is it through the house? Do you know? I believe that's accurate. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=236.62s)]
*  Yes. Now, of course, Tom Thomas Massey voted against it. It made it out of the house, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=241.46s)]
*  regardless. But of course, Donald Trump took the opportunity to attack Thomas Massey, who [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=249.58s)]
*  is objectively more America first than Donald Trump. I'm Donald Trump's most America first [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=256.18s)]
*  day. He has not been as America first as Thomas Massey on his least America first day. But [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=262.86s)]
*  it is there is something, you know, that's kind of interesting about this. Like, okay, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=269.86s)]
*  there's a few things. Number one, I guess, if you were to kind of zoom out, you would [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  say, there's nothing interesting about this. This is just par for the course. This is how [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=281.66s)]
*  government always operates. What are you telling me? The whoever's in the White House is going [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  to sign a gigantic spending bill. The establishment hacks and Congress will all gladly put all [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=291.42s)]
*  their pork into it. And Thomas Massey will vote against it. And it will go through. So [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=297.3s)]
*  okay. But in terms on that level, it just seems very normal. But of course, what's different [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=302.18s)]
*  about this is that number one, Donald Trump, you know, he claimed and many people around [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=309.22s)]
*  or many of his supporters claimed that he was kind of duped the first time, it would [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=317.94000000000005s)]
*  be different this time. Obviously, he had the whole Doge experiment behind him. But [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=322.62s)]
*  with all of that happening, essentially, we just got another giant spending bill crammed [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=328.38s)]
*  through. And I think, you know, is it a CBO numbers on this? They're never right about [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  anything. It's always worse than what the Congressional Budget Office says it's going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=340.9s)]
*  to be. But even they are claiming it's going to raise the debt by $4 trillion over the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=344.7s)]
*  next 10 years. It's just more of the same, none of the cuts that people were hoping might [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=349.74s)]
*  come through. And even the stuff they're talking about, about these tinkering around the edges, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=356.74s)]
*  like maybe they're going to try to clean up a little bit of the fraud in Medicaid or something [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  like that. Now, of course, it's just it's it's I'll say it's interesting, because when [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=368.3s)]
*  it comes to government spending, it's it's almost the only topic in politics today that's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  still so boring. Like everything else is like new and crazy and wild. But when it comes [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=381.16s)]
*  to government spending, it's the most boring arguments for it. It's the most boring criticisms [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=386.76000000000005s)]
*  against it. Of course, MSNBC gets it there, they're slashing government, they're kicking [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=392.72s)]
*  everybody off of welfare, something like this. But what we're really looking at is just it's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=397.36s)]
*  another meet the new boss, same as the old boss type deal here, where Donald Trump is [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=403.76s)]
*  going to demonize the only principled member of the house, or one of the very few. The [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=408.96s)]
*  Doge effort seems to have completely failed. And here we go off the fiscal cliff. I don't [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=417.12s)]
*  know. Any any thoughts on this, Rob? Well, I basically said it, they're raising it, I've [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=423.12s)]
*  heard between three and a half and $5 trillion, without any statements whatsoever of reenacting [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=429.84s)]
*  Doge. What is the movement with Doge now that Elon Musk is no longer at the, you know, at [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  the helms of it? What is the plan for reducing government spending? And particularly as people [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=441.96s)]
*  have gotten upset about raising prices, American manufacturing, and all this is a result of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=447.4s)]
*  government spending. And interest rates are going to start going up on our debt. I don't [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=452.32s)]
*  know that our Fed can endlessly buy our treasuries and pretend like there's endless demand for [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=457.84s)]
*  it. So listen, the financial stuff is boring until it isn't. And as to how much wiggle [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=461.88s)]
*  room the Fed has to engage in new quantitative easing, or other mechanisms to keep propping [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  up prices, if the thing finally goes bust, you know, then it gets real exciting and people [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=475.05999999999995s)]
*  get real angry. But there was a real opportunity with Doge and the American people to bring [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=480.76s)]
*  down the government debt. And it just seems like we're getting to the point where someone's [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=485.96s)]
*  going to have to deal with it. I don't understand how we can just push up interest rates, have [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=489.8s)]
*  these entitlement programs. You look at it on paper and you're like, this is going to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  pop at some point, this can't just go forever. And I don't know, Donald Trump has had as [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=497.52s)]
*  good of an opportunity as anyone to at least at least address the fraud, or at least make [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=502.64s)]
*  some sort of gestures to pretend like you want to get this under control. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=506.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, look, when you say it's a missed opportunity, it is and as you you got there at the end, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=510.0s)]
*  and you're absolutely right, it's this is on Donald Trump. And don't get me wrong, there's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=516.1999999999999s)]
*  a lot of people who you can blame and a lot of people who you can point fingers at like [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=522.84s)]
*  a lot, you know, there's this is Washington, DC afterward. And we're talking about when [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=526.96s)]
*  you're talking about government spending, you're talking about what is DC's budget. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=534.0s)]
*  And so obviously, there's a lot of forces in DC who are like, we'd like our budget to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=541.04s)]
*  be as high as possible, like, you know, kind of, kind of to be expected. But it kind of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=546.12s)]
*  just can't be overstated how much this is on Donald Trump. And that the actual issue [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=552.92s)]
*  is that Donald, first of all, Donald Trump doesn't know anything about anything. And [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=559.88s)]
*  he doesn't actually have deep convictions about any of this stuff. He didn't he never [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=564.36s)]
*  really had any deep convictions about getting to the bottom of government corruption, or [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=569.24s)]
*  draining the swamp for that matter, which again, not made this point a lot over the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=574.44s)]
*  years. But it is a really important one. So I'll make it once more here. Government [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=578.6s)]
*  spending is the swamp. That's the swamp. You want to drain the swamp, then you have [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=583.9200000000001s)]
*  to cut government spending. You want to continue the swamp, you continue government [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=588.76s)]
*  spending, you want to increase the swamp, increase government spending. That's what [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=592.84s)]
*  it is. Like these are very basic things, which by the way, Elon Musk does understand [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=596.92s)]
*  because he has several times tweeted videos of Milton Friedman making this exact point. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=602.24s)]
*  So like he does have some understanding of sound economics. But it's like this, right? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=607.68s)]
*  Government spending is the tax. Doesn't matter what your tax rate is, the the real [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  measure of taxation is government spending. Because in order for government to spend, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=621.8s)]
*  there's basic they have the government has three mechanisms by which they can spend [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=627.8s)]
*  money. Number one, they can tax you and they can spend the money that they've taxed from [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=632.1199999999999s)]
*  you. Number two, they can borrow the money. And essentially borrowing the money is just [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=636.16s)]
*  promising to tax you in the future. So they're they're borrowing against their tax [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=641.04s)]
*  slaves, which are us. And if they borrow, it's they can pay it back with what they can [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=646.96s)]
*  tax us from. And then the third mechanism is to print money. And printing money is [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=653.12s)]
*  essentially a tax too. It's, you know, it's just a tax paid in a different form. They're [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=657.76s)]
*  just robbing your purchasing power in order to spend money. And so by the way, this is [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=663.8s)]
*  the reason why, you know, if anyone else did what government does, it'd be a crime. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=669.88s)]
*  The reason why counterfeiting money is a crime is because you are robbing from [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=675.88s)]
*  everybody else. It's not just like counterfeiting shouldn't be illegal if this wasn't [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=682.12s)]
*  the case. You know, it's not like if you can counterfeit money, it's not like you just [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=687.76s)]
*  found a cheat code and now you get free stuff. You're robbing from everybody else by [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=691.84s)]
*  lowering the value of their money to get it for yourself. So that's what government's [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=697.0s)]
*  doing. They're doing the same thing. Okay. So if you understand that all government can [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=700.92s)]
*  do is tax you or promise to tax you in the future, then that's that's what government [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=705.72s)]
*  spending is. And when you talk about the swamp, I mean, what is the swamp? The swamp is [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=712.0s)]
*  that Washington, D.C. is filled with the most corrupt monsters in the goddamn world and [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=717.4s)]
*  that they only get money and resources from extracting it from the American workers. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=723.52s)]
*  The American working people have to have their money stolen from them to extract it to [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=733.64s)]
*  these criminals in D.C. so that they can spend their money on all types of corrupt and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=739.6s)]
*  destructive shit. You have, you know, you know, you look through it, all the, you know, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=743.84s)]
*  the richest districts in America and you see how many of them are right in the suburbs [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  right outside of Washington, D.C. Well, why is that? It's not because they have great [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=758.24s)]
*  big factories in Washington and they're producing so much stuff. It's not like, hey, this is [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=763.2s)]
*  capitalism, man. They're the ones who are making all the goods and services that everyone [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=766.96s)]
*  else wants to buy. No, in fact, they make no goods and services that anybody would [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=771.32s)]
*  voluntarily want to buy. You know, they make war. They make, you know, a bunch of, you [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=775.5600000000001s)]
*  know, grants for green energy companies. But that's the whole essence. That's government [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=781.6400000000001s)]
*  spending. OK, that it is the swamp. And the reason why this is so clearly on Donald Trump [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=787.44s)]
*  I will say that it seems to me in Trump 2.0 in the second Donald Trump presidency, 47, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=794.6s)]
*  not 45. Donald Trump seems to and there might be some, you know, there might be it might [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  be somewhat reasonable in some areas why he went this tack. But Donald Trump has been [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=816.04s)]
*  very focused on executive orders. He's been very focused on executive fiat. He seemed [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=821.56s)]
*  to be somewhat focused on this Doge thing, which was a creation of the executive and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=831.4399999999999s)]
*  not so much with Congress. Now, on some level, you might say that, well, you know, Congress [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=837.28s)]
*  is corrupt and Congress has failed on all these things. So he's pursuing these other [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=847.2399999999999s)]
*  means. But the reason why I point this out is to make it very clear, because there's [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=851.04s)]
*  really no passing the buck here. Donald Trump, this Doge thing, first of all, was very popular [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=855.64s)]
*  with the American people. And Donald Trump was in a position, you know, when Donald Trump [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=863.16s)]
*  has when he first came in for his second term, and he has record high approval ratings for [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=870.3599999999999s)]
*  Trump, his highest approval ratings ever, when he's he's north of 50% in terms of his [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=875.12s)]
*  approval rating. We have to understand what that means is that Donald Trump's approval [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=880.88s)]
*  rating amongst Republicans is in the high 90s. You know, like Donald Trump came in with [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=885.84s)]
*  the Republicans are all behind him. And what that means is that Donald Trump has enormous [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=891.92s)]
*  leverage over the Congress. You know, like if he wanted to, he could pick a few issues [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=898.36s)]
*  and go straight instead of blasting Thomas Massey for having some fucking principles, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=904.96s)]
*  he could have said, Listen, every goddamn Republican who's in the Congress, every single [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=910.6s)]
*  one of you have said you care about limited government. You've said you're against big [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=918.28s)]
*  government. You're for small government. You're for, you know, balancing the budget. You're [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=923.52s)]
*  against this fiscal insanity. He could have said he could have been like, Look, here's [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=928.48s)]
*  the Doge bill. I'm presenting it to Congress. There's nothing in this. It's a three page [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=932.8s)]
*  bill that says we're going to meet Doge's spending cuts, you know, recommendations. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=937.48s)]
*  And if any Republican votes against it, we're primaring you. Donald Trump is going to keep [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=944.16s)]
*  a list and expose them for the frauds they are. And they'd have to fall in line. They [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=948.96s)]
*  would have had no choice. The thing is, he just doesn't care about the issue that much. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=953.8000000000001s)]
*  He liked having Elon Musk around the campaign. He liked the energy that brought. He liked [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=959.48s)]
*  having a guy who would give him a couple hundred million dollars. He liked having a guy who [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=963.44s)]
*  would make sure his messages spread far and wide on X, make sure his people aren't censored, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  things like that. But at the end of it, he just didn't really care about cutting government [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=972.48s)]
*  spending. And the thing that's so frustrating, Rob, is that Donald Trump does seem to have [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=976.92s)]
*  look, he's in this situation here that's so unique, not only having such a high approval [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=982.5999999999999s)]
*  rating amongst Republicans, having the ability to put pressure on them, but also he doesn't [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=987.64s)]
*  have another election to win. He doesn't have to worry about getting reelected. And he's [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=991.8399999999999s)]
*  even said with the tariff stuff that he's willing to take some short term pain to have [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=996.36s)]
*  a bigger overall correction that would put America on more solid ground. But he just [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1002.64s)]
*  doesn't know enough to know that the only way to actually do that or the most important [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1007.84s)]
*  thing would be to hack up government spending and government regulations. That's the thing [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1012.9s)]
*  that while not the regulations, but while spending, there might be some short term pain. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1017.4s)]
*  And I'm not even sure there would be too much of that, to be honest, but it would put us [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1022.1999999999999s)]
*  on a long term, like on solid footing. And yet he just, he just doesn't choose to care [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1026.16s)]
*  about this issue. So I'm sorry, this is on Donald Trump now. And that's that. Any thoughts? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1033.88s)]
*  Yeah, my plea to the Trump loyalists is listen, Trump was better than the alternative. The [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1041.28s)]
*  alternative was dangerous. The alternative wanted to censor the internet, probably spend [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1046.28s)]
*  more money, and have even more central planning for windmills and things that are probably [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1050.2s)]
*  worse than trying to bring back American manufacturing and was going to open up the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1054.96s)]
*  border and probably support these words. The alternative was worse. But when Donald Trump [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1058.8600000000001s)]
*  does things like this, and you refuse to criticize him, you're no better than the Democrats when [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1063.48s)]
*  they tried to pretend that Biden doesn't have dementia, because hey, the other team so bad, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1067.96s)]
*  we all just need a rally behind this guy. And Trump is here, he is very powerful. And [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1072.54s)]
*  conservatives should care about fiscal spending, particularly when you just graph out the insane [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1078.8s)]
*  place that we are in right now. You look at every president and how they added to [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1084.52s)]
*  the debt, and then how COVID came around, and they just added even more. And now this [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1088.04s)]
*  is Trump's first, what are we six months in or whatever? I mean, this is the big, beautiful [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1091.96s)]
*  bill. But here's your opportunity to actually have a conversation about spending. And when [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1096.28s)]
*  there was so much interest in a great storyline, and at least reducing the fraud, to make no [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1100.6399999999999s)]
*  effort whatsoever to make any reduction, but instead, actually increase it by 3.5 trillion, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1105.78s)]
*  conservatives should be going, this is not what the conservative party should be. This [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1113.64s)]
*  is actually democratic socialism. This is the old school Donald Trump Democrat who managed [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1118.7600000000002s)]
*  to take over the Republican Party by speaking out for workers. And now you've got a democratic [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1123.24s)]
*  socialist who wants to increase spending even more. You guys should criticize him for it. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1128.16s)]
*  Yeah, 100%, dude. And like, you know, I will say there is something that might be, I mean, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1132.96s)]
*  somewhat of a red pilling, I hope not a black pilling, but that we got the richest, like [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1141.08s)]
*  most successful genius of all time, and put him on the task of government spending. And [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1153.28s)]
*  he couldn't do anything. You know, like we kind of got like, and, and look, there might [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1160.76s)]
*  be something in there. That's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's one that we ought to [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  swallow. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1170.3999999999999s)]
*  I think he probably could have done a whole lot. I just don't think you can really both [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1171.6s)]
*  have a government job and a private sector job at the same time. I do think that there [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1175.4399999999998s)]
*  are conflicts of interest in working both sectors at the same time. And in his instance, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1179.8s)]
*  the market actually punished him for it. And that he had a product that was very, you know, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1185.4399999999998s)]
*  firstly, I think he does a good job of, of chilling and creating more interest in his [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1190.8799999999999s)]
*  product and his stock price than is actually warranted based on, you know, what they're [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1196.84s)]
*  doing in the marketplace. And it's similar to what Donald the game Donald Trump's playing [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1201.3999999999999s)]
*  with tariffs is I don't think we're actually in a fiscally good enough position to be pulling [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1205.24s)]
*  these kind of gambles and trying to exert this much pressure on other people. We're [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1211.12s)]
*  trying to keep a faulty and broken system afloat. And I think Elon Musk ran into the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1214.6s)]
*  same little hiccup there. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1219.2s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. No, I think there's I think there's real, there's a real issue with that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1221.32s)]
*  I sent you the this tweet earlier, I thought this was interesting. This is from Elon Musk [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1226.84s)]
*  tweeted this a couple days ago. And he said, Well, it was responding to somebody who said, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1233.6799999999998s)]
*  I wonder if this is why Elon has somewhat moved away from politics. And he responded [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1241.9199999999998s)]
*  by saying, I have come to the perhaps obvious conclusion that accelerating GDP growth is [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1248.64s)]
*  essential. Doge has and will do great work to postpone the day of bankruptcy of America. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1255.72s)]
*  But the prolificacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1262.1200000000001s)]
*  can save our country. And so the what is that other than kind of giving up and going like, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1273.3200000000002s)]
*  look, this is we need that's not giving up. That's not giving up. That's going I pledge [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1283.2800000000002s)]
*  allegiance to overlord Trump. And I'm sorry that I educated the market over the fact that [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1288.3600000000001s)]
*  there's fraud and overspending in government. And so now to stay in line with the government [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1292.4s)]
*  and Donald Trump's that hopefully I can get favorable contracts. Yeah, well, you know, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1296.96s)]
*  American people that cutting spending is a mistake, because what we need is more government [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1301.1200000000001s)]
*  spending, because then there'll be future growth that gets us out of this mess. That's what that [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1304.96s)]
*  is. Well, yes, yes. So I get your point. But I just mean, giving up, but it's a little bit more [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1308.8s)]
*  corrupt than that. It's not just getting up and going, I couldn't do it. It's all right, I'll get [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1313.68s)]
*  in line and quit talking about the spending. Yeah, essentially, we're gonna have to grow our way out [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1317.6000000000001s)]
*  of this. And so of course, in a way, what this, you know, kind of misses the point is just that [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1323.32s)]
*  how corrupt and how damaging the institution of our government has been, and that it's like, oh, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1330.9199999999998s)]
*  okay, so we can't, we have to grow our way out of this. So in other words, the only the only answer [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1339.24s)]
*  is to feed this monster, to give it more. And then hopefully, we can just be so productive on top of [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1345.1599999999999s)]
*  that, that we can, you know, grow our way out of it was the problem is like, it's kind of like [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1352.4399999999998s)]
*  trying to, to deal with cancer, by being like, listen, we can't eliminate the cancer. So we just [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1358.44s)]
*  got to really hope to that the healthy cells grow a lot quicker than the cancerous cells. And like, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1365.64s)]
*  yeah, well, that's kind of not how it works. And you kind of actually do have to eliminate this [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1372.68s)]
*  cancer in order to, you know, make the patient healthy again. And look, again, it's just that [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1377.8s)]
*  this is when I say giving up, you're right, Rob, it's it's an important correction. But I just mean, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1386.76s)]
*  like, he's essentially admitting that like, Yep, the thing that I was selling you on, I can't do it. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1392.04s)]
*  I can't the thing that I was telling you that I was like, Oh, we're going to cut $2 trillion out [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1399.8s)]
*  of the budget, nothing's off limits, including the Pentagon, all that big talk really just resulted [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1404.76s)]
*  in nothing. And you know, this is something where I've been I've been of two minds about this. And [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1410.84s)]
*  I will say, as I said on the show, my instincts from the very beginning, where that Doge was not [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1417.8s)]
*  going to be successful, that Doge was essentially a made up government department, and that but I [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1423.56s)]
*  was like, Well, look, maybe they this will be great, though, at least like, get the issue [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1429.72s)]
*  addressed, and they'll get people talking about government spending again. And then there was [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1436.28s)]
*  now I will say, as I said this on the show, but I had dinner with the Vakram Swami, he was really [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1441.32s)]
*  high on dough. She was like, Nah, dude, we're gonna blow you away, there's gonna be some great things [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1447.24s)]
*  we're gonna do. A few weeks later, he was out of Doge. But regardless, he I did, I am humble enough [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1450.76s)]
*  to go like, All right, look, I have my preconceived notions, I have my views on things. But look, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1460.84s)]
*  obviously, like, Elon Musk and the Vakram Swami are incredibly brilliant, incredibly successful [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1465.32s)]
*  people. It's like, hey, maybe these guys actually got something figured out that I don't know about, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1471.32s)]
*  and they're going to be able to maneuver away here. But, you know, that didn't end up happening. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1476.12s)]
*  And now, to the point that you made before, Rob, there is, you know, it's true that when you were [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1482.12s)]
*  selling the thing as fraud and abuse, it's perhaps true that this was a more palatable way to sell [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1489.08s)]
*  cuts in government spending, you know, to point out the fact that, hey, look, here, there are these [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1498.6s)]
*  areas that we all agree, like, everyone agrees there shouldn't be fraud in Medicare. So, okay, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1503.24s)]
*  like, maybe we have a difference of opinion about, you know, whether Medicare is a good program, or [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1509.24s)]
*  Medicaid is a good program, or not, but we can all agree on the fraud. And look, we found all this [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1513.88s)]
*  fraud and USAID and all these other things. And so, yeah, okay, maybe there's like a wider audience [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1517.48s)]
*  that would accept that than just arguing for spending cuts because we need fiscal sanity. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1524.28s)]
*  But the problem is that when you sell it that way, and then you fail anyway, then you kind of get the [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1530.76s)]
*  worst of both worlds. Because number one, you failed to get any spending cuts anyway. But number [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1538.04s)]
*  two, you didn't even really educate the public about government spending. And I mean, look, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1544.12s)]
*  Elon did some of this, like I said, he was sharing some great, you know, Milton Friedman, Thomas [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1548.4399999999998s)]
*  Sowell videos and stuff like that. But I just feel like it's not only that they failed, it's like they [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1553.8s)]
*  never even really started the conversation about government spending that needed to happen. You [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1562.36s)]
*  know, like they never even really got into it, where it was like, look, like, you know, first of [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1567.6399999999999s)]
*  all, Donald Trump is sitting here advocating for a trillion dollar defense budget. So clearly, he's [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1572.28s)]
*  not interested in cutting defense, he wants to increase defense spending, which is, of course, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1577.72s)]
*  unnecessary and just a terrible policy. But then on top of that, it's like, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1583.8s)]
*  what are we, you know, if you're never gonna, you can't cut defense spending, he's unwilling to even [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1592.6s)]
*  talk about cutting entitlement spending. Okay. Well, then there's no fiscal sanity here. And the [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1597.32s)]
*  idea that, you know, like, it's almost like Elon Musk, maybe without ever saying it, but it certainly [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1604.28s)]
*  was pretty heavily implied that somehow, like, we could get our fiscal house in order without ever [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1611.72s)]
*  dealing with defense or entitlements, but just from finding like fraud, you know, just from finding [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1618.84s)]
*  like, you know, USAID spending money on trannies in Afghanistan, we'll balance the budget off [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1625.16s)]
*  cutting that, but that was always just made up. That's not true. I'm not saying there's no fraud, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1631.8000000000002s)]
*  there's tons of it. But the real thing is that the whole thing is fraudulent. The whole government is [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1636.76s)]
*  based off fraud at all of it. Look, all of these these entitlement programs are their their wealth [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1642.44s)]
*  transfer programs from a poorer group to a richer group. It's the most goddamn corrupt thing in the [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1649.88s)]
*  world. Like you could have an argument, right? You could have an argument in theory about wealth [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1656.7600000000002s)]
*  redistribution. Now, obviously, me and Rob would be opposed to wealth redistribution. I don't even [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1663.48s)]
*  like the term redistribution, because I don't think it's an accurate term. Wealth wasn't distributed [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1669.24s)]
*  to begin with. It was created. It was produced. It's not distributed. You know, like there's [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1674.28s)]
*  something about the term redistribution of wealth that almost like it's almost like cheating. It's [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1682.2s)]
*  like it's like a, you know, gender affirming care. Like you're the answer is baked into the description, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1688.2s)]
*  right? Because like if it's gender affirming, then obviously you should be for it. It's like [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1695.16s)]
*  reproductive rights, you know, these terms that people are right. I would just speak to your point. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1699.4s)]
*  Gender affirming care has the word care in it, which makes it seem like it's actually helpful. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1706.2s)]
*  So yes, kind of what you're speaking to with wealth redistribution has a word distribution as if it [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1712.0400000000002s)]
*  was just the wealth was just handed to some individuals. So now we're redistributing it. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1718.2800000000002s)]
*  Not well, right? Yeah, well, right. It was already distributed once. And obviously, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1722.52s)]
*  it wasn't distributed that great, Rob. So let's just redistribute this one more time. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1726.52s)]
*  And that, but the thing is that it never was distributed like in a, in a sense, like pay [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1730.76s)]
*  checks could be distributed, like a manager might distribute paychecks, but the wealth itself is [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1736.2s)]
*  created. It's not distributed, you know, so anyway, so I don't even like that term, but in theory, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1743.48s)]
*  you could have these arguments where like, maybe you'd have like a free market capitalist in a, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1751.08s)]
*  in a debate with a democratic socialist. And the democratic socialist would be arguing for [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1756.6s)]
*  distributive policies like, look, these people have so much, we should tax them and give it to [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1762.2s)]
*  the people who have less. And then the free market capitalist might argue, no, no, no, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1766.76s)]
*  you don't understand how economics works. And that in fact, when these people, when the wealthy [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1770.68s)]
*  people have money, they don't just sit on it under their mattress. And even if they did, that would [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1775.0s)]
*  just make everybody else's money more valuable. But in fact, this is what you need for the capital [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1779.64s)]
*  investment into new technologies and that this actually makes everybody richer. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1785.4s)]
*  That these are all interesting theoretical discussions, but Medicare and social security [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1789.96s)]
*  are like these viewed as like these third rails. Almost nobody even like at almost, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1799.0s)]
*  almost nobody has the balls to even just say, I think we should cut these programs, let alone [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1805.1599999999999s)]
*  actually push for that to be enacted. But both Medicare and social security are distributive [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1810.04s)]
*  policies that distribute money from a poorer group to a richer group. Young people are poorer [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1819.56s)]
*  than old people. They have lower incomes, they have lower net worths, they have less life, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1827.56s)]
*  they have less assets, obviously. And yet we're distributing money from them to the boomers. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1832.2s)]
*  It's like the most corrupt thing ever. And again, it's just nobody, nobody in dozer. Like, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1840.6000000000001s)]
*  essentially, I guess my point here is, is that if you're going to completely spectacularly fail on [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1847.0800000000002s)]
*  policy and deliver nothing, and then you're left with like, well, did you at least educate some [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1853.24s)]
*  people along the way? And it's like, no, they never even did that. They never even just told [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1857.64s)]
*  the truth, which would have been like, at least there'd be some value in that. And you know, this [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1861.88s)]
*  is how like these, these dousty and bargains kind of, uh, they, they end up working out this way [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1867.0s)]
*  quite often. It's like, Hey, it's like, just don't tell the truth. Don't tell the whole truth. You [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1873.16s)]
*  know, just, just cover up part of it. And then you'll get a little bit of what you want. And then [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1878.68s)]
*  you end up doing that and you don't even get the little bit of what you wanted. And then you just [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1884.7600000000002s)]
*  blew at least your one big opportunity, which would have been to just tell the truth on a loud [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1888.12s)]
*  from, you know, from, on a, from a loud stage, you know, tell the truth to a lot of people. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1892.9199999999998s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is crowd health, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1898.6s)]
*  a great company. They've been a long time sponsor of this show and they provide a much needed [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1903.1599999999999s)]
*  service, which is an alternative to the health insurance, uh, scheme, if you will. We all know [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1908.6s)]
*  the health insurance system is broken. We've spent a lot of time on this show over the years, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1915.0s)]
*  explaining why that is it's all because of government intervention, but now at least there [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1919.48s)]
*  is an alternative to health insurance, which is crowd health, which is essentially a group of [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1923.88s)]
*  people just like you who want to help pay for each other's unexpected medical expenses, but it's not [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1928.68s)]
*  insurance. It's a completely different way to pay for healthcare with crowd health. There's no [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1934.2s)]
*  doctors networks that limit who you can see. You can go to whatever doctor you'd like to, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1938.68s)]
*  and there are no networks. It is significantly less expensive than health insurance because it [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1943.24s)]
*  rips out the bureaucracy of the middleman singles are $185 a month. A family of four is $605 a month. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1948.0400000000002s)]
*  And right now, if you use the promo code P O T P you can get $99 a month per person for the first [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1955.88s)]
*  three months. So make sure to go check them out at join crowd health.com crowd health is not health [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1962.76s)]
*  insurance. It's a totally different way of paying for healthcare terms and conditions may apply. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1968.52s)]
*  All right, let's get back into the show. So I don't know, you know, I'd like to be wrong about [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1973.48s)]
*  this. Um, but it does seem to me that between that tweet, this spending bill, the way Donald Trump, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1979.72s)]
*  it's really quite something. It's not only did Donald Trump not insist on getting some spending [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1987.8799999999999s)]
*  cuts and then use his megaphone to put pressure on the Republicans who are fucking phonies. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=1993.96s)]
*  We've sat here, sat here for decades talking about how they care about fiscal responsibility [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2001.4s)]
*  right now in this moment when Donald Trump is enormously popular with Republicans, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2007.8s)]
*  when Republicans have the presidency and the house and the Senate and the Supreme Court [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2012.3600000000001s)]
*  and the culture, the Democrats approval rating is down in the low 20s. In this moment, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2017.08s)]
*  we're going to pass through another giant spending bell. And then on top of that, as the cherry on [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2024.6000000000001s)]
*  top, he's going to demonize Massey of all people. That's who he's going to go after Thomas Massey. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2028.8400000000001s)]
*  Um, so I mean, what can you say? What can you say other than Doge failed and Donald Trump failed? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2035.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, I tried, listen, I tried to not be one of these Debbie Downers about it [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2045.16s)]
*  from the beginning, which I could have just done from the beginning and going, this is all [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2050.6s)]
*  destined to fail anyway. But at least I was like, Hey, at least someone's trying. It seems [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2054.52s)]
*  let's try to get some enthusiasm going behind this. But I don't know what else to say. If someone [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2061.16s)]
*  wants to make an argument to me, like, no, no, no, here's where they really succeeded. Okay. Please [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2066.2s)]
*  show me. I'm not seeing it. It seems like a total failure. And then ultimately I think you got this [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2069.96s)]
*  right. Is that, and look, I'm not even blaming Elon Musk for this to be clear. I'm blaming Donald [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2074.8399999999997s)]
*  Trump for this. Not Elon Musk. Um, but I think you're absolutely right in your assessment, Rob, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2080.04s)]
*  that that was Elon at the end going like, all right, well, no point in me being a martyr [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2085.8s)]
*  over this cause that's going to fail. Anyway, I might as well go back to being a very successful, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2091.64s)]
*  you know, the most successful man in the world. That seems like a better deal. Yeah. We really [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2096.84s)]
*  just got to grow our way out of it. Okay. All right. Let's see if we could do that. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2100.84s)]
*  Uh, so two things. I, I think everything you said is a fair and good analysis of Donald Trump and [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2105.32s)]
*  where we're at. I'm always a little bit reluctant to bet against the guy cause he's got so much ADD. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2111.7200000000003s)]
*  You never know when he pulls a rabbit out of his ass and changes course. And then all of a sudden [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2116.6000000000004s)]
*  you're looking like a bit of an asshole for criticizing him. He does have that bugs bunny way [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2120.36s)]
*  of, uh, you know, making the criticizers look like assholes. So I, I still, uh, as much as I hate on [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2125.2400000000002s)]
*  the Trump loyalists, I still got, I'm always a little bit reluctant shitting on him the same [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2131.32s)]
*  way I shat on Biden. We're like, you knew that Biden was never changing course and it was all [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2135.48s)]
*  corruption. Uh, and then just speaking to, uh, Elon Musk's, uh, tweet, if government is spending [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2139.2400000000002s)]
*  money, not during a recession, what, what is the economic model that you're working with there for [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2146.04s)]
*  growth? And if you're taxing individuals and you're spending more money, I thought that, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2151.96s)]
*  I mean, that does two things. One is a crowd out, it crowds out the money available to the private [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2158.04s)]
*  sector. And then it also draws down capital within the country. So I'm not even really sure how [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2162.04s)]
*  government spending money now on entitlement programs or on the military or whatever else [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2167.72s)]
*  there need $3.5 trillion more for. I'm what, what is even the pitch for how this leads to economic [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2174.84s)]
*  growth? I understand an argument for, Hey, we're going to be spending more money cause we're [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2180.84s)]
*  cutting taxes, but that's going to lead to economic growth. I at least understand how you can present [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2184.2799999999997s)]
*  that argument. I don't even understand what the plan is here of increasing spending. Yeah. I, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2187.88s)]
*  firstly, if we just kept the spending levels without correcting anything, that was crazy. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2192.92s)]
*  We're increasing spending above that. Can you explain to me where the pitch is here of how that [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2198.28s)]
*  leads to economic growth in a way that we grow out of this? I mean, just where's the pitch. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2203.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, there essentially isn't one. It's just like essentially where, uh, DC is addicted [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2209.32s)]
*  to spending and they don't want to stop. And so there, and then you work around that to go, uh, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2215.88s)]
*  so then I guess the answer is to grow our way out of the economy or something like that. Um, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2224.12s)]
*  but all that seems to grow with this model is, um, the power and control of DC. Um, you know, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2229.6400000000003s)]
*  Natalie, could you pull in Rob emailed us, um, uh, several videos, but there was one, um, where it [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2239.72s)]
*  says the, the dissenters on spending bill on the spending bills you've got in the Senate, Ron Johnson [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2245.64s)]
*  and Rand Paul speaking. Oh, actually, you know what? Hold on. I think Natalie may not have been [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2252.12s)]
*  on that here. I'll, I'll just, uh, text it to you right now. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Rob. Yeah. You've [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2256.92s)]
*  got Ron Johnson and, uh, Rand Paul are the senators that I've heard, uh, speaking out against this. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2261.96s)]
*  Then you had Thomas Massey who had some, uh, some good words about it on the, uh, on the [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2267.8s)]
*  congressional floor. The, uh, Thomas Massey clip is a short clip. I think it's all about a minute [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2273.1600000000003s)]
*  and a half. And then the, uh, Rand Paul, I miss, yeah, the Rand Paul and the, uh, Ron Johnson are [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2277.48s)]
*  both longer news interviews, but the first couple of minutes are at least, uh, yeah, let's, uh, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2283.2400000000002s)]
*  let's, let's start with the, uh, the Rand Paul one, which is the first one I sent you Natalie. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2288.44s)]
*  Yeah. But it speaks to what we're getting at here, which is essentially a conservative should [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2297.8s)]
*  not be supporting increased in government spending. This is, uh, this is, this is not [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2304.04s)]
*  conservative and it's also just not good government policy. Well, you know, it's, it's interesting [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2309.4s)]
*  because Rand Paul, so Rand Paul came, uh, first got elected to the Senate in, uh, 2010. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2313.96s)]
*  Crazy now this was, um, 15 years ago. Um, but he first came in on the tea party wave. I mean, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2320.44s)]
*  he was here to be like, Hey, the whole thing is we're here to cut spending and get the fiscal [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2328.8399999999997s)]
*  house back in, uh, in order. And it is amazing how, like, it is just amazing to me as someone who, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2334.2s)]
*  you know, has been paying pretty close attention to this stuff for 20 years and is fairly well read [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2341.24s)]
*  on the history before that. Um, it is just in my lifetime, how much the Republicans have always [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2345.64s)]
*  claimed every time they're out of power, they go, Oh my God, these guys are spending so recklessly [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2354.44s)]
*  elect us to bring some type of sanity to this. And there's just been so many, every single time [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2360.8399999999997s)]
*  they have complete control of the government. There's some reason why now is not the time. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2367.4s)]
*  I mean, we can't even get with a, with a GOP controlled, um, uh, house Senate, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2373.08s)]
*  Supreme court and white house. We can't even get back to pre COVID levels of spending, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2380.2799999999997s)]
*  which were higher than the Obama levels of spending. We can't even get back to that, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2386.84s)]
*  you know? And look, I mean, this is, uh, this is the best argument to be a member of the [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2391.88s)]
*  libertarian party. And believe me, it's the, the arguments to join the libertarian party are only [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2396.44s)]
*  made by Republicans. Don't, don't listen to the libertarians. They'll convince you not to join. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2402.76s)]
*  But the only thing is just that it's like, look, the Republicans claim to stand for this shit. And [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2407.96s)]
*  how many chances do they get? There is never ever in my lifetime, been a year we're spending went [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2413.0800000000004s)]
*  down from the previous year. Republicans have never managed to do it. I mean, what, what can [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2420.92s)]
*  you say? All right here, let's, uh, let's go to, uh, this video here. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2428.6s)]
*  Joining us now, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Welcome back to Fox News Sunday. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2433.56s)]
*  Good morning. Thanks for having me. Okay. I want to get to some form policy, but first what's going [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2438.68s)]
*  down here in Washington as the big, beautiful bill as it's been called is now heading to you in the [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2443.24s)]
*  Senate. The Hill says this house GOP leaders spent weeks in delicate talks with Republican [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2447.8s)]
*  holdouts before cobbling together a fragile agreement. The critical voices of the house [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2453.48s)]
*  debate are cautioning their upper chamber counterparts not to alter their design too severely [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2458.52s)]
*  or it will never get through the house and its return. We'll talk about some of your specific [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2463.96s)]
*  objections, but how much does that worry, uh, factor into your calculus, whether or not what [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2467.8s)]
*  you do in the Senate can get back through the house. You know, the bigger a bill, the more it [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2473.08s)]
*  includes, the more difficult it is to get everybody to agree to things. I supported the tax cuts in [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2478.6s)]
*  2017. I support making them permanent. So I support that part of the bill. I support spending [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2483.4s)]
*  cuts. I think the cuts currently in the bill are wimpy and anemic, but I still would support the [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2489.2400000000002s)]
*  bill even with wimpy and anemic cuts. If they weren't going to explode the debt. The problem is [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2494.36s)]
*  the math doesn't add up. They're going to explode the debt by the house is 4 trillion. The Senate's [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2499.88s)]
*  actually been talking about exploding the debt 5 trillion this year in September. When our fiscal [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2504.92s)]
*  year ends, the deficit will be about 2.2 trillion. Now people used to always say the Republicans say [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2509.8s)]
*  what's Bidenomics, that's Biden spending levels. When March, every Republican, virtually every [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2515.4s)]
*  Republican other than me voted to continue the Biden spending levels, which are going to give us [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2520.6000000000004s)]
*  a 2.2 trillion dollar deficit. Now, if you increase the debt ceiling, 4 to 5 trillion dollars, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2525.1600000000003s)]
*  that means they're planning on 2 trillion this year and more than 2 trillion next year. That's [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2530.84s)]
*  just not conservative. So I've told them if they strip out the debt ceiling, I'll consider even with [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2535.32s)]
*  the imperfections voting for the rest of the bill, but I can't vote to raise the debt ceiling 5 [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2540.6800000000003s)]
*  trillion. There's got to be someone left in Washington who thinks debt is wrong and deficits [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2544.84s)]
*  are wrong and wants to go in the other direction. The idea that we're going to explode deficits and [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2549.32s)]
*  the projections are now looking at over 3 trillion dollars in deficits over the next 10 years, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2554.2000000000003s)]
*  I think is just, you know, not a serious proposal. So you know the debt ceiling is going to come [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2559.0s)]
*  sooner or later and Republicans, many of them and those who advocate for including the debt [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2564.04s)]
*  ceiling being raised within this measure say work today is broken. All right. Well, you could [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2569.0s)]
*  there you go. Pause it there. Oh, yeah. How can you even argue with this? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2575.96s)]
*  You know, it's funny because I've literally just been through this so many times, like just since [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2582.04s)]
*  we've had the show going. I've just been through this so many times at this point. But here is an [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2586.2799999999997s)]
*  argument that nobody can ever make. Nobody even ever pretends to. But it were simple, a question [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2591.0s)]
*  nobody can even answer. What is the point of having a debt ceiling? Like, why do we have one? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2597.8s)]
*  Listen, one of them, like one one of these corrupt congressmen have the integrity to just flat out [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2607.16s)]
*  say, I think we should get rid of the debt ceiling. They just have a debt ceiling. We have a rule [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2614.68s)]
*  under the law that says you can't go more than this much into debt. And then every time we hit [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2621.0s)]
*  that much, we just raise the number is just too ridiculous. So what's the point of having it? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2628.44s)]
*  The whole point of having the debt ceiling seems to be to raise it. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2635.08s)]
*  Yeah. And that's the point. They can pretend like they're doing something. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2638.44s)]
*  They can pretend what are you talking about? We're not financially responsible. We have a debt [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2641.64s)]
*  ceiling. And then we get together and renegotiate how we can safely raise it. And so what three [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2644.92s)]
*  times a year they get together, they threaten shutting down government, and then they have all [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2650.28s)]
*  their meetings. Then at the last moment, they want to go on vacation. And so they pass it. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2653.8s)]
*  And I guess they can create the illusion like they're actually doing something. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2657.48s)]
*  Yep. That seems like it's pretty much it. And, you know, again, like I said before, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2661.4s)]
*  but particularly like in this moment, we just can't get any type of movement on this stuff. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2667.6400000000003s)]
*  You're like, well, then I don't know what it's going to take before that we would get to a point [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2676.12s)]
*  where you actually could. But again, this is just, it's this continuous cycle of bullshit. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2681.3199999999997s)]
*  And yeah, as you said, this is the game that they play that we're going to constantly now multiple [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2690.3599999999997s)]
*  times a year have this, oh my God, the debt ceiling. And then, of course, it's kind of the [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2697.16s)]
*  typical, like I said at the beginning, it's this boring game where then they can phrase it, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2702.44s)]
*  or they can frame it, I should say, as anybody who ever talks about any type of cuts, no matter how [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2707.48s)]
*  modest they are, is, oh my God, you're kicking people off of welfare. Oh my God, you're kicking [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2714.28s)]
*  the most helpless people off of these programs. People are going to starve. It's going to be a [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2719.96s)]
*  nightmare. And then this is the whole game of how DC ends up keeping its corrupt system going. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2724.92s)]
*  And like nobody will actually look you in the eyes and say, oh, no, no, no. If all of the suburbs [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2731.88s)]
*  outside of Washington, DC, aren't permeated by multimillionaires who produce nothing of value in [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2741.2400000000002s)]
*  the market, then things would be terrible. They won't just say that to you because they know like [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2748.6s)]
*  that'd just be too crazy. But so what they will do is say, anytime anyone doesn't want to drastically [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2753.88s)]
*  increase government spending from its already insane high levels, you basically just want some [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2760.04s)]
*  poor single mom to not have healthcare. That's the game. And you would think, like, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2767.0s)]
*  one of the things that's kind of tragic about this is that you would think Donald Trump would [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2777.32s)]
*  have been the guy who was uniquely positioned to smack down all that bullshit and to just like, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2783.0s)]
*  he could have simply just rolled his eyes and been like, shut up. No one believes you guys anymore. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2790.36s)]
*  You know, man would have just been like, aha, yeah, he's right. You know, that's he's right. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2796.04s)]
*  They're all full of shit. No one's going to be starving. This is fine. And he doesn't want to do [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2802.12s)]
*  it. You know, and I don't know, it's like he wants he wants 0% interest rates again, he wants [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2808.12s)]
*  record high government spending, because I think he thinks that'll make the GDP in the stock market [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2816.6s)]
*  look really good at this time next year. And then Donald Trump can say, look, I delivered the greatest [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2822.8399999999997s)]
*  economy ever. And I think that's, I really think that's as simple that that's the explanation. But [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2827.96s)]
*  I don't know. Hey, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, a brand new [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2835.08s)]

*  I have an excellent brand in blackout. Not only is blackout coffee great, but it's also roasted [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2852.3599999999997s)]

*  freedom and capitalism and the Constitution and all of the things that we hold dear. They've got [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2863.08s)]
*  over 25,005 star reviews for a reason. This stuff is excellent. I've been sipping on the cold brew [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2868.52s)]

*  slash problem. All right, let's get back into the show. So the the other thing that Rand says here, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2905.4s)]
*  which I think is important for the Trump loyalists is he likes to say I support Trump, I just don't [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2911.16s)]
*  support raising raising the debt like this. And then I think it's worth playing the Ron Johnson [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2915.48s)]
*  clip because he talks about also coming in under the tea party. And he speaks a little bit more [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2921.0s)]
*  about not few not robbing from our future generations, which not enough people are talking [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2926.92s)]
*  about the fact that you know, we're still in from the grandkids here. Yeah, all right. Let's let's [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2932.68s)]
*  play that. Let's play that clip. But yeah, well, look, it's a it's a pretty, a pretty important [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2938.12s)]
*  point. And, you know, you would it isn't it interesting to how it's only through government [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2944.04s)]
*  that you even can do something like that? Like I can't, it's it's illegal for me to do that as a [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2951.8s)]
*  parent, I can't like, max out credit cards in my daughter's name. You know what I'm saying? Like, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2958.2s)]
*  I can't just spend on present consumption, and then saddle her with the debt. It's only through [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2964.2s)]
*  the mechanism of government that we can do this. But my God, if you ever let's just say theoretically, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2970.68s)]
*  you could do that. You like, it's just how monstrous it's for it's for family household [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2976.04s)]
*  growth. It's if we lived in a nicer house now, she'll have a brighter future and earn more. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2982.68s)]
*  And then but then you cut and it's just like, I'm just driving like a Bugatti. And you're like, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2987.3199999999997s)]
*  Whoa, Dave, you bought this or what I put it on my daughter's credit card. Like when you immediately [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2992.2s)]
*  you'd be like, what a monster. Like if somebody did this in their personal life, you'd think of [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=2996.7599999999998s)]
*  it as like the most evil thing. And yet this is how our economic system maintains itself. It's [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3001.16s)]
*  truly crazy. All right, let's play this this clip. We need to establish goals. Listen, this is the [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3007.8799999999997s)]
*  weekend we honor the service and sacrifice of the finest among us, you know, more than a million that [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3013.72s)]
*  died defend this nation. I don't think they I don't think they served in sacrifice to leave our [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3018.04s)]
*  children completely mortgaged their future and their prospects diminished because of it. So we [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3022.52s)]
*  need to be responsible. The first goal of our budget reconciliation process should be to reduce [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3030.12s)]
*  the deficit. This actually increases a bit. Let me describe the mess. President Obama averaged [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3035.16s)]
*  about $910 billion of deficits per year. President Trump in his first three years averaged about [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3041.16s)]
*  810 then COVID hit over $3 trillion in deficit. It should have ended there. We should have [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3046.12s)]
*  immediately returned to a pre pandemic level spending but President Biden averaged $1.9 [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3051.88s)]
*  trillion of deficits over his four years. And according to CBO, those deficits now average [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3056.92s)]
*  $2.2 trillion over the next 10 years, we'll add $22 trillion. And I'm sorry, the House bill would [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3062.36s)]
*  probably add I've calculated 4 trillion. You're saying you have these independent analysts saying [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3068.28s)]
*  it's 3.3 to 4 trillion. I agree with that. We have to reduce the deficit. And so we need to we need [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3073.08s)]
*  to focus on spending, spending, spending. So what you don't defeat the deep state by funding it. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3079.32s)]
*  Right. So what changes are you going to push for in this bill when the Senate takes it up? You want [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3085.56s)]
*  to make $6 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. You say just for comparison, that's the [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3090.84s)]
*  equivalent of almost the entire federal budget from last year. Here's where all that money went [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3097.0800000000004s)]
*  last year. We're just holding up a chart. You already know the percentages here of how much is [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3101.6400000000003s)]
*  going to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Pentagon and on and on. Where would you make cuts? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3105.64s)]
*  So first of all, you take a different approach. You don't start at $7 trillion, a completely [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3113.56s)]
*  unjustified level spending, and then subject yourself to death by 1000 cuts, you start with [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3117.64s)]
*  a reasonable pre pandemic level spending. You've heard people talk about zero based budgeting. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3122.68s)]
*  I'm talking about a budget of 5.5 to 6.5 trillion. Those are options from Clinton, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3127.4s)]
*  Obama and Trump, where you just take their actual outlays plus them up by population growth and [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3133.48s)]
*  inflation, leaving Social Security, Medicare and interest untouched. That would leave you somewhere [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3138.28s)]
*  between 5.5 and 6.5 trillion dollars. So you start there, but you have to do the work and you need [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3143.0s)]
*  the time to do the work. I have to believe when you go through $7000 billion of spending, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3148.6s)]
*  if you go by it line by line, like Doge has done, you will find hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3155.0s)]
*  And I've proven this in terms of where the spending occurs, hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3159.72s)]
*  It's amazing just how much the overdue window has shifted that here you've got the guy who's the [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3164.68s)]
*  extremist on spending just going, let's go to the pre pandemic levels. Like, listen, I know that we [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3169.16s)]
*  couldn't afford that. And I know back then I would have said, hey, we got to bring it down. But you [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3176.12s)]
*  guys have gotten so crazy. Listen, I won't touch your Medicaid. I won't touch your Social Security. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3180.3599999999997s)]
*  I won't touch anything. In fact, I'll actually increase it relative to the inflation and [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3185.0s)]
*  population growth. But can we at least just halt it there? I mean, that's how much of a shift we've [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3189.08s)]
*  had from a conversation about rolling back government spending is that the most extreme [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3193.72s)]
*  position on the news of rolling back government spending is let's just go to the pre. Remember [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3200.36s)]
*  when it was the biggest emergency that ever happened in America? So we had to spend more money. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3204.84s)]
*  And we said we were only going to do it once because we're in this huge emergency. Can we [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3209.48s)]
*  at least honor what we said there and go to the before that loony levels? And that's the [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3212.2s)]
*  radical position. It's really, it's really, I don't know, it's just kind of crazy to watch [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3217.0s)]
*  that this is the extreme position. It's wild too, because you see this all look, this is the entire [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3221.8799999999997s)]
*  story of the 20th century. And it's been the story of the 21st century as well, that it's always, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3229.24s)]
*  this is why Michael Malice said, which I always loved this quote, thought is one of the best [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3236.12s)]
*  quotes he's ever had. And there's a reason why it caught on so much. But he said, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3240.36s)]
*  conservatism is progressivism driving the speed limit. So it's just like, you're still going in [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3244.1200000000003s)]
*  the same path. It's just, they're kind of like, Hey, slow, let's, let's just keep it at 65. You [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3250.6800000000003s)]
*  know what I mean? Like it's, it's, there's, look, the, the old right, as Murray Rothbard called them, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3255.48s)]
*  which was, you know, like Robert Taft and Garrett, Garrett, and people like this. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3263.48s)]
*  They essentially rose up in opposition to the New Deal, which was of course, FDR's economic plan [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3269.48s)]
*  to get us out of the Great Depression, which if you go check the numbers, didn't, it did not get [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3277.64s)]
*  us out of the Great Depression. In fact, it's the reason why the Great Depression is remembered as [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3283.16s)]
*  the Great Depression. It's not the Great Depression isn't remembered because the stock market crashed [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3286.6s)]
*  in 1929. In fact, there was a crash in 21 that was more severe than the one in 29. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3291.88s)]
*  The crash, there's a great book on this. Have you ever read this, Rob? It's such a good book. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3299.96s)]
*  It's called The Forgotten Crash. It's by Jim Grant. But it's all about the crash of 21. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3304.76s)]
*  And essentially what happened was in 1921, the huge stock market crash was a bigger correction [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3313.7200000000003s)]
*  than the Great Depression and then the crash in 29. And essentially the government just didn't do [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3320.84s)]
*  anything. It just did nothing. The Federal Reserve had only been open for a few years. They weren't [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3325.7200000000003s)]
*  really even like up and running to the level that they were later. There was no government [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3331.1600000000003s)]
*  spending programs, no increase in regulations, and it was over. A year later, the economy had [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3336.52s)]
*  completely recovered and it was over. Then cut to 29, the stock market crash, you have these huge [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3343.8s)]
*  government spending projects. And then in 32, FDR comes in and institutes the New Deal. And the [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3349.4s)]
*  unemployment was in double digits. I think it was at 25% at one point, well into the 30s, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3357.56s)]
*  years and years and years later, and the problem was still happening anyway. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3364.84s)]
*  So there were these, they wouldn't call themselves conservatives, but what you might think of as [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3368.76s)]
*  conservatives at the time, who were opposed to the New Deal. However, Reagan, now this is decades [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3374.2s)]
*  later obviously, but Ronald Reagan was an FDR Democrat who switched over and became a Republican [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3383.8799999999997s)]
*  because he was like, oh my God, the size and scope of government is getting too big. And yet none of [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3390.2799999999997s)]
*  them would ever, in the 60s, Lyndon Johnson had the Great Society, another huge expansion of [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3395.3999999999996s)]
*  government. At the time, the conservatives in the Republican Party would have said, we're against [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3403.32s)]
*  this, we're against these programs, we want to repeal these programs. But by the time they get [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3410.92s)]
*  back into power, all of a sudden these are things you can never touch. No one could dream of touching [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3416.1200000000003s)]
*  Social Security, no one could dream of touching Medicare. Look, the Republicans ran on repealing [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3420.04s)]
*  and replacing Obamacare. Has anyone even mentioned that since the Republicans have all been in power, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3426.12s)]
*  the idea of repealing Obamacare? None of them are even talking about doing that. And so you always [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3434.04s)]
*  have this thing where kind of like a new giant entitlement gets proposed, people rail against [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3439.72s)]
*  it, they say, oh, there's going to be a disaster. The people who are for it are like, look, it's [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3448.68s)]
*  only going to cost this much, it'll be blah, blah, blah, it's going to be great. It ends up costing [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3452.2s)]
*  seven times as much as they say, and it under delivers on their promises. And then you get to [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3456.4399999999996s)]
*  a point where it's just codified. Now that's part of, I mean, they call them entitlements, for God's [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3461.7999999999997s)]
*  sakes. Like it's just something you're entitled to. And so nobody can take it away from you now. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3467.96s)]
*  And so this is where we keep going. But it is funny, as you point out, Rob, that the hawk, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3473.3999999999996s)]
*  the fiscal hawk here is saying, could we go to five years ago? Would that be possible? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3479.4s)]
*  Could we get back to the levels that we were five years ago, which were substantially higher than [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3486.76s)]
*  Obama error levels of spending? Man, it is just pathetic. I think Ron Johnson is one of the good [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3491.56s)]
*  guys. What other senator do you hear actually mentioning the deep state on the news or the [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3498.6s)]
*  fact that we're stealing from future generations? But it's just unbelievable that the guy who comes [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3503.72s)]
*  off as a fiscal conservative extremist is going, let's just go to even more spending than Obama, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3509.8799999999997s)]
*  please. Well, it's a sad, it's a sad state of affairs. It's like if you're, you're like an [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3515.64s)]
*  abolitionist at the height of slavery, and there's one person up there who's like, maybe don't whip [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3520.12s)]
*  them so hard. And you're like, all right, how about that guy? Can we take up his proposal? That seems [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3525.24s)]
*  like a reasonable proposal, right? And they're like, this guy would free all the slaves. You're [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3531.56s)]
*  like, he didn't even say that. He didn't even say he just said, don't hit him so hard. Is that [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3536.2799999999997s)]
*  possible? I listen. I do. We got to wrap there. Apologize for the show being late today, but we [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfJACZ3Byyg&t=3540.2s)]
