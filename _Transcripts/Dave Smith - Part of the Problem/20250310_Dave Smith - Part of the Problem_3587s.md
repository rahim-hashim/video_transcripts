**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg)
*  What's up, what's up everybody? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=10.56s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  He is Robbie the fire Bernstein. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  We are back from up north. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=16.26s)]
*  How are you feeling Rob being back in the free country of America? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=18.12s)]
*  I it's nice being back here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=22.0s)]
*  You don't realize how much we have until you have to see Canada, an entire country designed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  to look like Newark, New Jersey. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=29.68s)]
*  It's alright. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=31.92s)]
*  Listen, Rob hasn't been to Canada that much and we where we went in St. Catharines is [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=32.92s)]
*  not necessarily representative of the full of Canada. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=36.24s)]
*  Nice people out there though. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=39.88s)]
*  We did have a very nice time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=40.88s)]
*  I like it's a we had a great time in Buffalo, great time in St. Catharines. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=42.32s)]
*  It does when when when we go to Canada, it does feel like the audience that we draw to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=46.36s)]
*  our show are the best people in Canada. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  I'll go a step further. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=57.92s)]
*  It seems like the only good people in Canada come out to our show. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=59.36s)]
*  So we support those people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=63.96s)]
*  We'll get them out of there before before the massive bombing campaign. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=65.68s)]
*  That's inevitable. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=69.24s)]
*  I told a lot of Canada jokes that were doing very well. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=70.24s)]
*  This one got nothing but I still just think it's true of the country is that every time [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=73.16s)]
*  I meet Canadians, they're very nice people. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=77.02s)]
*  I don't understand how they seem to all come together to forge that socialist shithole. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=79.68s)]
*  Like there's something odd about when Canadians combined. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=84.4s)]
*  It's like a bad power rangers or something. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=87.52s)]
*  I know what you mean. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=90.28s)]
*  I know what you mean. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=91.44s)]
*  Well, there is something I mean, there's got to be a connection. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=92.44s)]
*  I don't have like a fully worked out thesis or anything on this, but there's got to be [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=94.96s)]
*  some connection between like socialist the way socialism is sold and taking advantage [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=98.28s)]
*  of like people's kindness because it is always sold that way. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=106.52s)]
*  It's always sold is like, but don't you just want to be a decent person? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, come on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=114.52s)]
*  Be good. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=116.04s)]
*  I mean, I was I don't know, by the way, I don't know if you've seen this, Rob, and I [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=117.04s)]
*  haven't been like I am. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  I don't pay very close attention to like local politics in general, even when I'm talking [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=124.68s)]
*  about like New York City. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=132.56s)]
*  But I have kind of been paying attention a little bit to the New York City mayor race, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=133.56s)]
*  Cuomo announced that he was running again and that, you know, obviously for obvious [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=140.16s)]
*  reasons, right, like he was such a major figure in the whole covid insanity. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  But there's like of the I'm blanking on his name, but of the like progressive candidates, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=149.76s)]
*  the guy who's leading is like a democratic socialist. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=156.68s)]
*  And I saw he had like an ad for his his candidacy for mayor. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=161.2s)]
*  And it's all just like it's all, you know, it's like, hey, you know, you guys think it's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=167.84s)]
*  expensive here, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=175.56s)]
*  Why don't we just make it free? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=177.08s)]
*  Why don't we say, hey, you know, we got all these slow buses. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=179.68s)]
*  I say we make them faster and free daycare. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  That's one of the biggest costs. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=186.24s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=187.72000000000003s)]
*  No cost for daycare. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=188.84s)]
*  You know, like, oh, all right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=189.84s)]
*  It really is like it's wild to watch it where you're like, what a what a huge advantage [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  it is just in terms of like selling to normies your policies when you get to just I mean, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=197.48s)]
*  look, I'm not saying like he he act, but it's like when you just he just says it'll be no [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=203.88s)]
*  cost. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  The buses will be free. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  Childcare will be no cost. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=213.0s)]
*  And if that's the world you're playing in, like if the world were the game we're playing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=214.48s)]
*  is that I get to pretend that I just have like a magic wand that can like make things [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=218.6s)]
*  free. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=224.52s)]
*  And then you're just like, why wouldn't we do it? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=225.52s)]
*  Oh, you're saying we shouldn't do it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=227.8s)]
*  It almost like without saying this extra step, it's just kind of implied. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  But it's almost like going like, hey, Rob, you have a magic wand and you won't even wave [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=234.62s)]
*  it to make everything free. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  Like it does it on some level, it just plays on like I'm a nice guy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=239.52s)]
*  And you're like a bad mean person who just doesn't care. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=243.84s)]
*  Of course, that's you know, I don't know, I guess it's a little frustrating because you're [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=247.28000000000003s)]
*  like, wouldn't wouldn't almost every person like immediately go to the question of like, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=250.92s)]
*  wait a minute, but we can we can do that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=255.92s)]
*  That's an option. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=258.44s)]
*  We can just make things not cost anything. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=259.44s)]
*  I don't know about you, but I always thought the rent was too damn high. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=262.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's that guy's still around. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=265.28s)]
*  Is he in the race? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=269.08s)]
*  I mean, he he made it bring down a shockingly long amount of time. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=270.36s)]
*  And then like people would it very weird with that guy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=277.14s)]
*  I don't know much about him, but he did. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  Almost everyone knows who that guy is, I feel like. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  I like people like quote the line like when you said it, it didn't take me a second to be like, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=287.44s)]
*  wait, who are you talking? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, in any other context, if you were talking about like the guy who perennial [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=291.64000000000004s)]
*  perennially came in seventh place in a mayor race, I would have no idea who you're talking [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=295.6s)]
*  about with that guy. You're like, oh, right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=301.0s)]
*  It's too damn high. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  I got a ring and a brand new rent branding for the win. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  What can I say? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=306.8s)]
*  Jimmy Mc what is it? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=308.68s)]
*  Jimmy McMillan, 78 years old. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  All right. Well, I don't I don't know. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=313.68s)]
*  I don't know if he's still out there, but this guy is also complaining about the rent being too damn high. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=315.44000000000005s)]
*  Anyway, I always just found it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  And this is true in general. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  It's not just with socialists. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's true with Democrats in general. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=325.32000000000005s)]
*  To the extent that they borrow a little bit from socialism. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=329.04s)]
*  But there is like an interesting thing and it's such a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=332.36s)]
*  it's such a like a comment on either the intelligence of the people who are pushing these policies or their perceived intelligence of the people of the voters who are listening to them push these policies. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=335.56s)]
*  But the idea of being like, look, if we're going to let's just say there's a thing that that's got to get funded or whatever, you know, for for example, child care, just because that was the the comment in this in this ad that I saw. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=348.24s)]
*  So like there could theoretically be an argument where you go like, OK, so there is this service that is child care. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  And there's this one model where like people do it privately. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=371.76000000000005s)]
*  Basically, the model is that you have to voluntarily come to an agreement with the person who's going to be charging you for is going to be providing you the child care. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. So if someone wants to watch your kids, then you have to ask them how much they charge. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=384.88000000000005s)]
*  If they say they charge X, you can say I can't do X, but I could do X minus 10. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  They go, I can't do X minus 10. I could do X minus five. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=392.88s)]
*  And you know what I mean? Like, that's the model like a free market in child care. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=395.84s)]
*  The other model is that we all we the government force you at the threat of imprisonment to send us money. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=399.64s)]
*  We then take that money. We hire the child care and you don't have to pay for it at that point because you've already paid for it through us. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  OK, now these are two different models and you could have an argument about those models of which one you think is better. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=417.6s)]
*  Now, when you just describe it the way it is, I will admit that the free market model already sounds more attractive because like you're already you're like, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=423.56s)]
*  well, I don't know if I like the group with a violent with a monopoly on aggressive violence threatening to imprison me if I don't fund the thing. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=431.92s)]
*  That that seems like a worse model. But like, OK, those are the two models that I'm describing the way they actually work. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  But like when is it just something like what a mindfuck it is that the people who support the forced monopoly model get to just describe it as free. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=446.92s)]
*  You just get it. You know, there's stuff you want. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=458.76s)]
*  You just get it as it like as if I mean, I know this is like the most basic observation, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=462.0s)]
*  but it's like I'm still saying it because they're still making this claim that it's like, OK, if the people doing the child care are getting paid at all, then it's not free. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=466.24s)]
*  It's just a question of who's paying it and where is the funding coming from? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=476.2s)]
*  No one gets to say no cost unless then unless we get to a point where you can like either through slavery. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=480.28s)]
*  I mean, I guess there'd still be costs associated, right? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=488.4s)]
*  Like that person still has to live and eat in order to show up for work the next day. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=490.44s)]
*  But either you could enslave them and they just work for free or you get into the realm of magic. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=494.48s)]
*  Those are the only ways that things don't have a cost. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=500.36s)]
*  So we're saying the reason they have socialism in Canada is that despite them being kind and upbeat people, they're rather stupid. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=502.96s)]
*  I'm saying they're really, really friendly, dumb people. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=509.4s)]
*  Yeah, they're gullible, but nice up in Canada. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=512.68s)]
*  I guess that's what we learned from our one hour excursion over the border. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=515.84s)]
*  I like to consider us experts. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=519.64s)]
*  We went we went a good 20 minutes deep into Canada. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=522.24s)]
*  We literally we went far enough into Canada where we could still like touch America like we were still on base the whole time. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=525.12s)]
*  Anyway, it was a lot of fun. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=532.16s)]
*  Oh, and then I should mention that we are next stop is Boston, which I'm very excited for. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=533.32s)]
*  We just always me and me and you always have a lot of fun up in Boston and we always draw great crowds up there. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=539.64s)]

*  So very much looking forward to going up to Boston. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=547.16s)]

*  We'll be up at Laugh Boston Comic Dave Smith dot com for those tickets. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=555.28s)]
*  Also reminder, it's coming up sooner than than later in May. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=559.76s)]
*  I will be back at the Soho Forum debating immigration and a live Oxford style debate in New York City. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=565.44s)]

*  OK, I got dates, too. Oh, oh, oh, go ahead. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=584.84s)]
*  Libertarian Party State Convention out in Iowa in April. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=588.0799999999999s)]

*  Putting all that shenanigans together and then, of course, the run your mouth podcast. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=599.8s)]
*  All right. Well, that's a that's awesome. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=604.24s)]
*  Make sure to go see Rob there and make sure to go check out run your mouth. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=607.52s)]
*  So I got there's there's a couple of things on my mind for today's show. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=610.52s)]
*  And I guess broadly speaking, like there's a couple of things going on in foreign policy related that I thought were pretty newsworthy events. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=615.84s)]
*  And then there's also, you know, just kind of one of the things domestically, I guess that is perhaps the most interesting dynamic right now. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=626.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's number two behind the stuff Trump's doing. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=635.64s)]
*  But it is really interesting watching the Democrats trying to grapple with the position that they're in. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=639.44s)]
*  This is kind of the the topic of discussion amongst almost every person who's either left of center liberal leftist, everybody kind of in the left half of America. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=649.48s)]
*  Whenever you see these days, if you see a show, whether it's like Bill Maher or the Pod Save America guys or just any anyone kind of nominally on the left, this is the talk. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=663.76s)]
*  It's like, what do the Democrats have to do to come out of this? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=678.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's it's appropriate. I mean, I've seen different times in my life now that I've been around for a little while. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  I've seen times where one party was up big and the other party was down and out. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=689.48s)]
*  You know, there's a few that come to mind. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=696.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, there was a well, when when Barack Obama first won and won a pretty dominant victory, people were saying, well, the Republicans have really been defeated. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, at the time, George W. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=711.64s)]
*  Bush was going out with the lowest approval ratings for an incumbent president. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=713.48s)]
*  Dick Cheney had the lowest approval ratings for any vice president. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=717.52s)]
*  Then here comes in this extremely popular Barack Obama had some of the highest approval ratings in polling history in America. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=720.48s)]
*  And now, OK, it seemed like that party had been pretty soundly defeated when when Donald Trump won the first time, people were saying the Democrats were down. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=730.0400000000001s)]
*  It does seem to me that this is different in scale and kind than any other situation like that. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=739.9599999999999s)]
*  I've just never I've never really lived through something quite like with one of the major two parties being as devastated as the Democrats are right now. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=748.36s)]
*  As I've said before on the show, it's to lose your voter base and your propaganda apparatus all in one election is quite a loss. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=758.04s)]
*  And they've also just lost a. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=768.8s)]
*  A kind of cultural factor that's hard to put into words, but I guess to say it, the in the simplest terms, it's like they they made the Republicans, the cool kids and the Democrats, kind of like the nagging Karens, which is really like it is. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=772.28s)]
*  For someone my age, I'm going to be 42 next month for someone my age who was born in 1983. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=791.24s)]
*  It's hard to overstate how impossible that would have seemed like the idea that the Republicans could ever be the cool ones amongst 17 year olds or something like that just seems like, I mean, that would have been like unthinkable. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=798.2s)]
*  As as like as unthinkable as like if you were like, OK, like if you had a bet with someone in like the 11th grade or something and you were like, I got to turn someone into the coolest kid in school. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=817.68s)]
*  And I was like, all right, you got to turn the principal into the coolest kid in school and be like, OK, well, that's impossible. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  That cannot be done. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=835.5999999999999s)]
*  That was making the Republicans the cool guys is like on that level. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=836.7199999999999s)]
*  So anyway, all of this is going on. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=839.4799999999999s)]
*  And while this is happening, it's interesting to see everybody kind of give their own thoughts on what exactly it is that the Democrats could do. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=842.76s)]
*  Some say you got to like go harder against Trump. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=851.88s)]
*  Some people say you got to abandon the woke stuff. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=855.6s)]
*  Some people say you got to, you know, get the working class vote again. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=857.92s)]
*  It's you know, it's interesting. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=863.92s)]
*  And so anyway, this is kind of just one of the things that I've been thinking about. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=866.08s)]
*  And while everyone is talking about this, you see like these these different wings of the Democratic Party and, you know, like what their vision for how you're supposed to do this is this, I guess it is leading to some of the stuff that we're talking about now in this context. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=869.5600000000001s)]
*  It does seem like there's some there's different Democrats who are kind of like starting to make some noise. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=888.4s)]
*  I still have not seen anything yet that I think has a chance of being successful. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=895.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what you do, Rob, if you think there's one way or another or one strategy or another that could rise back to to be successful. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=899.6s)]
*  But I'm not seeing it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=908.52s)]
*  I think it's unbelievable how poorly the Democrats are operating right now. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=909.68s)]
*  The best messengers they have are Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=913.68s)]
*  They're not doing a particularly good job. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=918.0s)]
*  Then they had that incredibly cringe video with Cory Booker that they were all reading the exact same script and they're like trying to be edgy for all their thing of the dignity of the office. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=920.48s)]
*  Now, like they're trying to figure out how to use curse words, but they don't know how to like you said, they just don't know how to be cool. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=932.0s)]
*  It doesn't fit their personalities. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=937.76s)]
*  Also, I think that the way that they're trying to figure out how to use the word of the word of the word is that they're trying to be edgy. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=939.76s)]
*  They just don't know how to be cool. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=947.6s)]
*  It doesn't fit their personalities. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=949.6s)]
*  Also, the Democratic senators block the bill to keep women out of men's I mean, men out of female sports. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=951.6s)]
*  I think the trans issue is such a loser for them. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=957.6s)]
*  And their old guard, you know, they're still trying to pitch Ukraine war to the end. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=961.6s)]
*  And then when they're putting out social media videos, you got that lady looks like a witch. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=967.6s)]
*  She put out a weird video last week. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=971.6s)]
*  They seem to be just at a total loss for how to and by the way, the branding for them is easy. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=974.48s)]
*  We're supposed to be the party of the people and we're supposed to make sure that you guys have good jobs and great benefits. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=978.48s)]
*  So we're going to go back to what we're doing, except that they seem to be so in bed with the deep state and to be on that side that they can't not pitch wars. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=984.48s)]
*  And I think as Elon Musk, we've said it before has returned freedom to the internet. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=990.48s)]
*  I think the key is that you have to recognize that it's not the way the issue is put out is like, well, what can the Democrats do to get the voters back on their side? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=997.36s)]
*  Or what can they do to get the working class back on their side or minorities back on their side or something like that? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1022.24s)]
*  But you realize if that was just the case, then the Democrats would have been operating in a different manner for many years now. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1028.24s)]
*  Like if the idea was getting enthusiasm and fundraising and votes and getting back. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1036.24s)]
*  Well, then they would have been embracing Bernie Sanders back in 2016. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1042.24s)]
*  If the goal was to stay relevant and dynamic and win voters in this ever changing culture. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1047.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, they had figures like Bobby Kennedy Jr. or Tulsi Gabbard or people like this. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  They ran all of them out with the exception of Bernie Sanders. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1059.1200000000001s)]
*  They attempted to run Bernie Sanders out. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  They just didn't realize that Bernie Sanders is such a pathetic loyal dog that he was like, I'll just wait. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1065.1200000000001s)]
*  That's cool. I'll just wait here in the yard and wait till you give me some scraps. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1069.1200000000001s)]
*  But the real key there is like what you said about the deep state. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1074.0s)]
*  The goal isn't how do we get everybody back? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1078.0s)]
*  How do we become popular again? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1082.0s)]
*  That's actually fairly straightforward. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1084.0s)]
*  The goal is how do we maintain CIA control over this party and get the agenda of the CIA while winning people back? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1086.0s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Tax Network USA. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1096.0s)]

*  Alright, let's get back into the show. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1160.64s)]
*  And look, I'm not, I mean, that might sound a little kooky or whatever, but like, did you see, Rob, by the way? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1162.64s)]
*  I don't know. We didn't talk about this on the show at all. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1168.64s)]
*  Did you see who the Democrats have give their official response to the State of the Union speech? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1170.64s)]
*  I think it was Bernie Sanders. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1174.64s)]
*  No, Bernie Sanders gave one, but that wasn't their official one. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1176.64s)]
*  Bernie Sanders did it just like in the same way me or you could do it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1181.5200000000002s)]
*  Like he just made one and put it up. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1185.5200000000002s)]
*  And yes, that was more, it's so funny because yes, you think of that as the response because yeah, like that's actually to some degree what would represent Democratic voters. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1187.5200000000002s)]
*  But no, they had this chick, oh damn, I'm blanking on her name. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1195.5200000000002s)]
*  But she was a CIA officer. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1199.5200000000002s)]
*  She was literally a CIA employee. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1201.5200000000002s)]
*  I mean, you know, Rob, she's a former CIA employee, which is, you know, a CIA agent. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1203.5200000000002s)]
*  She's a former CIA employee, which is, you know, doesn't really exist, by the way, if anyone that is what a lot of CIA insiders have said, too. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1210.4s)]
*  It's there's no such thing as former CIA agent. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1218.4s)]
*  No, but she she goes and gives the speech. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1220.4s)]
*  I'm trying to hold on. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1224.4s)]
*  Well, I'll find her her name here. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1226.4s)]
*  Where was it? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1230.4s)]
*  Yes, the official Democratic response. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1233.2800000000002s)]
*  It's the she's from Michigan. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1235.2800000000002s)]
*  Yes, she's a senator from the chat. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1239.2800000000002s)]
*  I didn't just thank you. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1241.2800000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1243.2800000000002s)]
*  So she's a senator in Michigan. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1245.2800000000002s)]
*  Now she did. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1247.2800000000002s)]
*  You could say she did. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1249.2800000000002s)]
*  She won her her Senate seats, I think, very by a very thin margin. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1251.2800000000002s)]
*  But it was in a state that Trump won. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1255.2800000000002s)]
*  So I guess that, you know, that that at least says like, well, she must have. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1257.2800000000002s)]
*  Typically, I'm not saying this. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1262.16s)]
*  Put out the cool ad of look, I can drive backwards. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1264.16s)]
*  I learned all sorts of cool shit. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1266.16s)]
*  I'm not sure that I'm not sure. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1268.16s)]
*  I don't think I saw that. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1270.16s)]
*  But typically, the the kind of the the traditional wisdom would be that if you on a presidential election day where one candidate wins, if you're from the other party and you won, that would indicate that you must have carried some of their votes. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1272.16s)]
*  Because that's who came to show up. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1291.0400000000002s)]
*  So, like, if Donald Trump wins, you know, 52 percent of the vote or whatever. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1293.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, that means 52 percent of the people coming out there voted for Donald Trump. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1297.0400000000002s)]
*  If you won, you must have at least won some of his votes. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1301.0400000000002s)]
*  That's not technically necessarily true because people could not vote for president and just vote for their senator. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1303.0400000000002s)]
*  But it's generally probably true. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1309.0400000000002s)]
*  But the woman literally worked for the CIA and she comes out and her it gave like a Cold War speech. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1311.0400000000002s)]
*  She goes, Donald Trump is cozying up to Vladimir Putin. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1319.92s)]
*  Ronald Reagan was president when we won the Cold War. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1323.92s)]
*  If Donald Trump was president back then, we probably would have lost the Cold War. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1325.92s)]
*  So, like, that is the CIA's conception of how to win back Democratic voters is to go, we're Reaganites now. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1329.92s)]
*  It's just as if that's like that's where the Democrats, the voters are at. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1337.92s)]
*  But so that's just to your point. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1343.92s)]
*  This is literally what they're attempting to do. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1345.92s)]
*  Well, let's put our CIA woman out there. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1348.0s)]
*  Maybe she'll want him back over. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1350.0s)]
*  And it shows you that it's not, again, in the same sense that it's not like, hey, how could MSNBC get higher ratings? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1352.0s)]
*  How could CNN get higher ratings? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1360.0s)]
*  Well, we all know lots of things they could do to get higher ratings. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1362.0s)]
*  That's not really their issue. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1366.0s)]
*  Their issue is how do we keep pushing this agenda and get higher ratings? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1368.0s)]
*  Now, that's much trickier because the agenda has been rejected. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1372.0s)]
*  But like, you know, like we've said before, like, there's a million ways that you could figure out how to get the number one show in cable news if you were unencumbered by what topics you're allowed to talk about. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1376.08s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1386.08s)]
*  Do it. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1388.08s)]
*  Here, I got a new show for you, MSNBC. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1390.08s)]
*  It's called The Epstein Files. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1392.08s)]
*  And every single day, this show is dedicated to one news story and one news story only. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1396.08s)]
*  And that is getting to the bottom of the Epstein story. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1401.08s)]
*  We are going to. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1404.1599999999999s)]
*  Hey, there was a pedophile ring that was, you know, with American girls being molested and systematically abused. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1405.1599999999999s)]
*  And this involves so many of the most powerful people in our media, in our culture. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1413.1599999999999s)]
*  He had shady. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1417.1599999999999s)]
*  This guy Epstein had ties to some country in the Middle East, as Dan Bongina would say. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1419.1599999999999s)]
*  We have no idea which one. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1425.1599999999999s)]
*  But so, OK, do that. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1427.1599999999999s)]
*  We're going to interview victims. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1429.1599999999999s)]
*  We're going to interview. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1431.24s)]
*  We're going to get all the people who were around him and grill. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1432.24s)]
*  Then we're going to put all the best reporting together. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1434.24s)]
*  And every night we're going to give you more information about the Jeffrey Epstein case. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1436.24s)]
*  You tell me there's a chance that wouldn't be the number one rated show at MSNBC. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1440.24s)]
*  Do you think I mean, like the video clips would be getting fucking 20 million hits online every single day. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1444.24s)]
*  Everyone would be driven to OK, they could do that. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1450.24s)]
*  But why can't they do that? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1453.24s)]
*  Because they're not just in it for the ratings that would defeat their entire purpose. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1454.24s)]
*  They're there to prop up the regime and, you know, through like the deep state or what, you know, like that's what they're there to do. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1458.32s)]
*  So they can't go. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1464.32s)]
*  So anyway, what's really interesting about the Democratic situation is that like there will be occasionally you will see some some people like real left wingers who will kind of point stuff like this out. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1465.32s)]
*  They'd be like, I mean, we could be opposed to the military industrial complex. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1476.32s)]
*  That's very popular, you know. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1480.32s)]
*  And they're like, yeah. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1482.32s)]
*  And they're like, yeah. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1483.3999999999999s)]
*  But the whole point is we're trying to figure out how we can support the military industrial complex. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1484.3999999999999s)]
*  So that one doesn't exactly work. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1488.3999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, in this absurd vacuum, some of the more. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1491.3999999999999s)]
*  Colorful figures in the Democratic Party have have been out there kind of giving a lesson on, in my opinion, what not to do. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1497.3999999999999s)]
*  But we've got a few of those. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1508.3999999999999s)]
*  Let's start with let's do the Elan Omar one first. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1509.48s)]
*  Rob, I think you haven't seen this yet, but I did find this to be just pretty pretty damn entertaining. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1512.48s)]
*  We recently had one of your Republican colleagues, Brandon Gill, on the show. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1520.48s)]
*  He said that America would be better off if you were arrested and deported. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1524.48s)]
*  He also said that there was audio of you advising what he said or illegal immigrants here from Somalia on how to evade ICE detection. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1528.48s)]
*  I want you to respond to that. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1536.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again, you know, these are people who have really stopped caring about our institutions, really stopped caring about our Constitution. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1537.56s)]
*  We know that folks who are here, whether they are documented or undocumented, we know whether you are a permanent resident or you are a citizen, you have constitutional rights. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1547.56s)]
*  And it is really important for people to know those rights. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1558.56s)]
*  I know that it is red meat for his base that are a sinophobic and racist to say to them that I am going to find a way to arrest and deport a member of Congress who he thinks is doing something wrong when I am doing the right thing in trying to make sure everybody that is within my constituency has the resources and the information that they need. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1561.6399999999999s)]
*  She was democratically elected by members of the people in her district. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1580.72s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1585.72s)]
*  But just just to follow up very quickly, just be clear, you're not calling his all his base xenophobic and racist, right? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1586.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, he is feeding to something. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1592.72s)]
*  He has a petition out. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1595.72s)]
*  He's getting donations. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1596.72s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1598.72s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1599.72s)]
*  He knows he can't deport me. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1601.8s)]
*  There is no grounds for my. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1602.8s)]
*  So this information is only being put out there by him for a reason. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1604.8s)]
*  And that reason is because he has a base that feeds off of that. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1608.8s)]
*  Congresswoman Ilana Omar, thanks so much for coming in. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1612.8s)]
*  I appreciate you. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1614.8s)]
*  I appreciate you very much. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1615.8s)]
*  Is there something, Rob? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1616.8799999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1619.8799999999999s)]
*  We're done with the video. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1620.8799999999999s)]
*  But isn't there something amazing? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1621.8799999999999s)]
*  I know I like to point this out all the time because I do think it's like a subtle thing that sometimes people don't even notice. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1622.8799999999999s)]
*  But it's now again, of course, most people do, or they at least like to point out that they are not aware of it. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1630.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1637.8799999999999s)]
*  But when I say they don't notice, they may not notice the tactic. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1639.96s)]
*  They notice overall that CNN is completely like corrupt and on one side of the issue. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1642.96s)]
*  But like, you know how we we've talked about this a lot before. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1648.96s)]
*  Whenever they're like if they're interviewing Donald Trump, they'll or JD Vance or someone like that, they'll do this thing where like you say something and then they'll do the same thing. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1651.96s)]
*  You give you give the answer to the question. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1662.04s)]
*  And then before I start the next question, I just go. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1664.04s)]
*  We already know that that's not true. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1667.04s)]
*  Moving on to you know what I mean? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1669.04s)]
*  Like they don't even give you a chance to get back. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1671.04s)]
*  They're just like, but then what does Wolf Blitzer do when he's got he's got Ilan Omar here? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1673.04s)]
*  She just says her piece and then he is supposed to be playing neutral. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1677.04s)]
*  So I can't say I don't think that's true. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1682.04s)]
*  So you know, I'm not even here to play the role of Trump, I'm just saying you know, like, that's a very good point. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1684.04s)]
*  neutral journalist, but then he just turns over and goes, and she was elected by our [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1691.04s)]
*  constituents as if that ever needs to be pointed out about a congressperson. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1696.2s)]
*  Yes, that is, isn't that the default assumption of anybody who's in the member, is a member [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1702.28s)]
*  of Congress that they won an election to get there? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1708.76s)]
*  But yet he just turns over to go, she got, and she got votes. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1710.96s)]
*  Saying that like what, anyway, that's just interesting. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1714.28s)]
*  So here's a strategy that maybe the Democrats could pursue. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1717.98s)]
*  How about this? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1720.8999999999999s)]
*  Anybody who objects to her, in her words, giving resources to illegal immigrants so [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1721.8999999999999s)]
*  that they can evade ICE must be a racist. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1731.9399999999998s)]
*  There's one strategy. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1738.54s)]
*  It's like, by the way, as I've gone through the polls, you know, before, it's not, it [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1739.9399999999998s)]
*  is, it was a 50 50 issue amongst Democratic voters, whether they support mass deportations, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1746.1s)]
*  super majorities of the American people support it. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1753.9399999999998s)]
*  So she's talking about 50 percent of Democratic voters, like 50 percent of the people of the [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1756.62s)]
*  minority of the American voters who even still voted Kamala Harris. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1762.6999999999998s)]
*  50 percent of them, I guess, are xenophobic racists, according to Elon Omar. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1768.1799999999998s)]
*  So, like, just saying of all the strategies, this one doesn't seem to be the best. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1774.1399999999999s)]
*  But maybe I'm missing something, Rob. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1779.5s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1780.9399999999998s)]
*  Maybe I'm just racist. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1781.9399999999998s)]
*  I don't think you're missing much. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1783.34s)]
*  And it's incredible how poorly she speaks the English language for being a congress [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1784.8999999999999s)]
*  lady. And I see from Jamaica, she's almost talking like in dress like a Jamaican lady. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1790.9399999999998s)]
*  That gets a little bit confusing. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1795.1s)]
*  But, yeah, I don't think I don't think lecturing to individuals who don't like everyone pouring [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1797.6999999999998s)]
*  over the border and wanting to control who's in the country and screaming at them that [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1803.54s)]
*  they're racist is a very good way of marketing this. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1807.22s)]
*  Well, isn't it isn't it wild, too, that it's like if you're if you are making this [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1811.1s)]
*  argument and like I, you know, I'm doing a debate on immigration at the Soho Forum, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1816.3s)]
*  as I mentioned, coming up soon. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1821.18s)]
*  And maybe some of this stuff will come up there. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1822.3799999999999s)]
*  But it does seem to me that unless you're arguing for open borders, like unless you're [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1824.42s)]
*  taking a pure like a pure position of there should be absolutely zero restrictions on [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1831.54s)]
*  anyone in the world if they want to come here. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1841.18s)]
*  If you're not, which is, look, there are some people who take that position. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1844.38s)]
*  I, you know, vehemently disagree with that. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1848.18s)]
*  It is wildly unpopular. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1851.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1854.18s)]
*  You know, again, like I haven't seen I've tried to find numbers on like what percentage [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1855.42s)]
*  of the American people support open borders. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1862.14s)]
*  And the truth is that it is so unpopular that no one even ever asks the question. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1865.0200000000002s)]
*  And I look at all these immigration polls and it's very I found one ever that I think [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1871.2600000000002s)]
*  it got like four percent. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1877.1000000000001s)]
*  And this was from many years ago. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1879.1000000000001s)]
*  The truth, they never even ask that question. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1880.9s)]
*  They ask, like, would you like higher levels of immigration or lower levels of immigration? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1882.7s)]
*  Do you support mass deportations or only deportations of violent criminals? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1887.22s)]
*  Do you like these are the questions asked? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1891.22s)]
*  Because I at this point, when supermajorities, you know, support mass deportations, I really [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1893.02s)]
*  doubt you could get two percent of people to say that they support zero restrictions. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1901.22s)]
*  But if you want to make that argument, whether people support it or not, you could make the [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1906.1000000000001s)]
*  argument. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1909.66s)]
*  Again, I don't agree with that, but you could make the argument. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1910.82s)]
*  But short of that, short of arguing that there should be zero restrictions, I don't see how [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1913.3s)]
*  you get to go on your moral high horse here of like you're a racist xenophobic if you [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1919.5s)]
*  think that people who came here illegally should be forced to leave. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1925.1399999999999s)]
*  It's like, well, then that's the whole then that's the whole thing. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1929.06s)]
*  It's like if you believe in any immigration restrictions, well, then obviously, at some [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1932.06s)]
*  point, you got to restrict people. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1935.8999999999999s)]
*  Right. Even if you were to say that, you know, Americans, we take in more immigrants than [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1937.58s)]
*  anywhere in the world, both legally and illegally. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1942.3799999999999s)]
*  But I think we should take in a lot more, you know, like whatever the exact numbers [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1945.4199999999998s)]
*  were under Joe Biden, we're taking in like a million legal immigrants a year. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1950.02s)]
*  And then they were having hundreds of thousands, you know, to millions pour in every month. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1954.74s)]
*  We don't exactly know the numbers. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1959.06s)]
*  But let's just say you were like, I think the number should be way higher. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1960.58s)]
*  I think we should take in 10 million immigrants legally every year. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1963.1399999999999s)]
*  It's like, OK, well, then those 10 million come. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1967.86s)]
*  And what happens when more come on top of that? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1970.2199999999998s)]
*  I mean, unless you're just for open borders, you'd have to believe in restrictions at some [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1973.3799999999999s)]
*  point. OK, then they have to be restricted. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1976.6599999999999s)]
*  And then but then to turn around and say that makes you racist or xenophobic or something, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1978.6999999999998s)]
*  it's like, is your argument that if if anybody in America does not believe that [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1984.74s)]
*  anyone in the world has a right to come here, whether they follow our laws or don't, if [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1993.06s)]
*  you don't believe that you're a bad person somehow. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=1997.46s)]
*  Again, the reason I just mentioned this is just because it's like you see these Democrats [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2000.58s)]
*  struggling to figure out how to deal with this moment. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2005.3799999999999s)]
*  And then it's almost like at least one of them, not that she's a representative of all [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2009.1399999999999s)]
*  of the Democratic establishment, she's certainly not. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2013.54s)]
*  But you have one of them out here who's like, hey, here's my idea. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2016.1799999999998s)]
*  Let's lean into this very popular policy and say that you are an evil person if you [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2020.74s)]
*  support it. It's just wild to think that anyone would even like anyone in the game of [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2028.94s)]
*  politics would think that this is something you could say out loud. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2034.3s)]
*  But of course, when you do that, you can count on Wolf Blitzer to nod along and remind [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2038.14s)]
*  everybody that you were elected. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2042.42s)]
*  Also, when she says that illegal immigrants have constitutional rights, I don't think [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2043.82s)]
*  it's a constitutional right to not be deported. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2048.54s)]
*  They might have rights of not being just illegally held in prisons indefinitely. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2051.42s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, no, look, right. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2056.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's like it's not. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2058.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you can't torture them or beat them over the head with a club. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2059.74s)]
*  Sure. Like there are they still do have like human rights, but they do not. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2062.7799999999997s)]
*  The whole point is they do not have the right to be here. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2067.2999999999997s)]
*  And that's a very different thing. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2070.62s)]
*  And that's a very different thing. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2072.22s)]
*  That's a very different claim. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2073.7s)]
*  Yes, it's true. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2075.22s)]
*  Right. And I'm sure all of us, I know for a fact, me and you support this. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2076.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. But it's true that anybody and the Constitution is clear about this, that anybody [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2081.06s)]
*  who's here, any U.S. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2085.9s)]
*  persons, any person who is in the United States of America has rights, meaning like if they [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2087.18s)]
*  were charged with murder tomorrow. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2093.98s)]
*  OK, well, they get a lawyer and they get a day in court and they get to they get to put up [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2097.3399999999997s)]
*  a defense and call witnesses and face their accuser and all of those things. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2103.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? What face your accuser and murder? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2106.66s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying? But I'm just saying like they have basic human rights. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2108.7s)]
*  Sure. Like they they we can't just give them the electric chair or throw them in jail [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2111.8999999999996s)]
*  for life without a trial because they're not U.S. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2118.22s)]
*  citizens. Sure, they have rights. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2120.2999999999997s)]
*  But that isn't the question. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2121.94s)]
*  The question is, do they have the right to be here? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2123.7s)]
*  Do we have the right to say, hey, you came in here illegally, you have to leave and get [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2126.22s)]
*  back in line if you want to come in here. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2129.78s)]
*  And how should we feel about a sitting member of Congress who is going out of her way to [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2131.82s)]
*  like obstruct the law and the new administration implementing this legal and very [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2137.58s)]
*  popular policy? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2143.42s)]
*  That's the question that's relevant. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2145.02s)]
*  Again, they don't want to answer that. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2147.7s)]
*  And look, CNN seems happy to go down with the ship, too. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2149.18s)]
*  The other the other Democrat who is seemingly kind of emerged is this I'm blanking on her [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2152.98s)]
*  name, but here let's let's let's play the next clip that we have here. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2161.18s)]
*  Do you have the next one, Mike? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2175.1s)]
*  There we go. It is not a criminal violation to enter the country. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2176.8199999999997s)]
*  Illegally, it's not it's not a criminal crime. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2182.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not a crime, which is why they're so frustrated because they really want our local [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2185.94s)]
*  law enforcement to go out and round up people when they could be looking out for the [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2190.74s)]
*  murderers and the sexual abusers, as well as the robbers. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2195.46s)]
*  They want them to go and round people up on civil accusations. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2198.94s)]
*  And so it is not a criminal violation to enter. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2203.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2206.62s)]
*  Illegally. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2207.8599999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2209.7799999999997s)]
*  So this is. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2210.22s)]
*  All right, let's stop that one. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2213.4599999999996s)]
*  So this is the other angle that I guess they could go with that. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2215.98s)]
*  It's not we we should only be deporting the criminals and we shouldn't be rounding up [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2220.1s)]
*  other people. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2226.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't know, Rob, what do you think? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2227.66s)]
*  No, I think this is worse than that because she's saying it's not a crime for them to [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2229.4599999999996s)]
*  have entered illegally. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2234.3399999999997s)]
*  That's just that's not true. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2235.8199999999997s)]
*  It is. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2237.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's just false. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2238.06s)]
*  Now, if you want to make if you want to make the argument of, hey, I'd rather use our [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2239.8199999999997s)]
*  law enforcement for policing crime than wasting it on immigrants that are have come in [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2245.06s)]
*  illegally, but have otherwise been peaceful and actually an asset an asset to our [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2252.46s)]
*  community. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2256.3799999999997s)]
*  You can make that argument. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2257.2999999999997s)]
*  And yeah, you could say, hey, why are we wasting federal resources on people that even [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2258.8999999999996s)]
*  though they came here illegally are actually making a meaningful contribution. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2263.02s)]
*  You can go argue that. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2266.66s)]
*  And that might even be what she's trying to say. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2268.1s)]
*  But instead, she's just lying and is mistaken when she says that when they came into the [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2270.66s)]
*  country illegally, they didn't commit a crime. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2275.14s)]
*  That's not English. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2277.5s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2278.3s)]
*  How do you come into the country illegally without committing a crime that that that [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2279.14s)]
*  seems to illegally crossing the border is a crime? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2283.94s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2286.54s)]
*  But right to your point, I mean, look, like, first of all, I don't even [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2288.2599999999998s)]
*  disagree necessarily with like, look, there really should be an order of operations if [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2292.58s)]
*  you're talking about deportations. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2299.1s)]
*  And and I've as I've always said, the the first most important thing was stemming the [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2300.7s)]
*  flow of of illegal migrants coming to this country, which seemed Donald Trump seems to [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2305.54s)]
*  actually be correct in what he said about his state of the union, which is turns out [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2310.74s)]
*  just meaning business about it pretty much takes care of that. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2314.7s)]
*  I personally have been shocked at like the fact that there are record low illegal boarding [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2318.66s)]
*  illegal border crossings. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2325.1s)]
*  It's really amazing how much of that is a result of just who's sitting in the Oval [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2326.5s)]
*  Office and what is their messaging sound like, which, you know, I guess kind of makes [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2333.94s)]
*  sense in hindsight, but that it's like you just it's quite a journey to go on and people [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2337.8199999999997s)]
*  aren't going to do it if they think they're just going to get turned away when they get [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2343.1s)]
*  there. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2346.3399999999997s)]
*  And so when Joe Biden's in, you have record high illegal crossings when Trump's in [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2346.7799999999997s)]
*  now, you have record low, pretty incredible juxtaposition there. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2352.14s)]
*  But if you want to argue like, hey, we should go after the violent criminals first, I [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2355.8199999999997s)]
*  don't think you're going to get much of an argument out of me and you on that. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2361.7s)]
*  But the thing is, like, again, this this almost it becomes more of like a philosophical [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2365.54s)]
*  conversation when you're just saying like, OK, fine. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2371.18s)]
*  But then like, but listen, do the people who illegally came into our country, do they [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2374.2599999999998s)]
*  have the right to not be kicked out? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2380.14s)]
*  And I don't really see a compelling argument that they don't like that. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2382.78s)]
*  You know, it's like, no, you don't like look, there are places you don't have a right to [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2388.42s)]
*  be. And like in a libertarian sense, this is like essentially in pure libertarian [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2392.82s)]
*  theory, right? You'd be like, OK, there are basically two types of people or maybe you [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2398.78s)]
*  could say three types of people who enter property. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2405.0600000000004s)]
*  OK, there are the people who own that property and they can enter it any time they want [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2409.1400000000003s)]
*  to. Then there are the people who are invited onto that property and they can enter it [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2414.5s)]
*  as at the owner of the property's discretion. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2419.5400000000004s)]
*  And then there are people who are not invited onto that property who enter it anyway. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2422.5s)]
*  And that is known as trespassing and trespassers can be removed at the owner's [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2427.62s)]
*  discretion. And so, like, I just don't understand exactly why that theory doesn't [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2434.94s)]
*  scale. You know, like why why that shouldn't ultimately scale up to a nation and that if [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2441.54s)]
*  there are people who were not invited by the domestic population who came in against the [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2447.7s)]
*  rules, why is it exactly that they just cannot be removed? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2452.94s)]
*  It's a very it's an interesting when you really think about it, Rob, obviously without [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2457.62s)]
*  just getting the detail of like the criminality of illegally of illegal border crossing [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2462.7s)]
*  wrong. Really, what the implication from this view is, is that if you ever make it here, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2467.18s)]
*  no matter how you made it, this should be home base. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2473.98s)]
*  You should be safe, like in a game of freeze tag. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2478.54s)]
*  And this is I'm you know, can't get me now. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2481.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm on base. And that is just nutty. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2484.2200000000003s)]
*  It makes absolutely no sense. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2487.22s)]
*  And it is so distant from where the American people are on this issue at the moment. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2488.98s)]
*  Yeah, it just seems like the failure of the Democratic branding across the board, like [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2495.18s)]
*  I said just last week, they're defending still trans people in female sports. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2500.3s)]
*  And here you have another issue that the American population would like to get cleaned [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2505.38s)]
*  up. And nope, they would they're still willing to defend that we need to have humanity. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2509.22s)]
*  And so therefore all of these illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2515.2999999999997s)]
*  And also we need to have compassion on Ukraine and we need to continue to support that [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2518.8199999999997s)]
*  worse that more other people can die. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2523.14s)]
*  And by the way, they got low hanging fruit of just go challenge Donald Trump on the [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2524.98s)]
*  tariffs and that we got a weak economy and he's going to cause a recession for all of [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2529.54s)]
*  the people that are looking to have things be cheaper. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2533.58s)]
*  You got some winning cards. Go play those. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2536.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Well, I think honestly, the Democrats are in a situation where they're [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2539.62s)]
*  in now where it's in order for them to actually play cards that are going to win. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2545.06s)]
*  They kind of and this is what it's the kind of the nature of these things. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2551.7s)]
*  They actually need Trump to make a mistake and a really big one. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2556.14s)]
*  Like they kind of can't you know, it's like that's that's a challenge in politics. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2560.54s)]
*  I understand. But you've just they've they have boy who cried wolf themselves into a [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2565.74s)]
*  corner. They can't just they can't. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2571.5s)]
*  Pretend that something is a huge outrage if it isn't because they've just like that card [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2576.06s)]
*  has been played. And even if Donald Trump does say something that's fairly outrageous, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2580.62s)]
*  they can't make a big outrage of it because it's like, you do that with everything he [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2585.22s)]
*  says. So it doesn't matter. You just you have no you're you have no currency in this [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2588.46s)]
*  exchange anymore. You're going to have to wait for him to really fuck up. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2595.54s)]
*  You're going to have to hope that he really blows it. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2599.62s)]
*  And so maybe your strategy could be to try to lure him into making a really bad decision [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2601.9s)]
*  and then exploit that. But that seems to me to be their hope that he can really he [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2607.18s)]
*  really fucks up and then they can be like, oh shit, this is a goddamn disaster. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2613.14s)]
*  And we wipe our hands of it because we were against it or something like that. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2616.94s)]
*  But I just don't think like the look you can they can hope that if Trump proceeds with [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2620.74s)]
*  mass deportations, the implementation of that is really ugly and brutal. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2626.14s)]
*  And people are like, shit, I just can't support this. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2630.5s)]
*  And then they could maybe. But but to just try to get ahead of the issue when Donald [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2633.06s)]
*  Trump because again. Look, again. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2637.5s)]
*  Leaving aside like all the aspects of politics and how Trump actually governed compared [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2642.62s)]
*  to how he how his rhetoric is, the bottom line is that in the in the perception of the [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2648.58s)]
*  American people and somewhat fairly, Donald Trump was saying he wanted to build a wall [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2653.46s)]
*  back in 2016. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2657.78s)]
*  Donald Trump was saying these people shouldn't be let in back then. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2659.86s)]
*  And now you're going to bitch and moan that after we let all those people in that some [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2663.18s)]
*  of them are getting kicked out. But Donald Trump's position was never none of them should [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2667.7400000000002s)]
*  have been here to begin with. And so he can almost play in this way that like, yeah, it [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2671.02s)]
*  is unfortunate. You know, the borders are what's his name? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2675.38s)]
*  I'm blanking on this. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2679.1s)]
*  Orman or something. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2679.9s)]
*  Orman. Yeah. Harbin, Tom, whatever. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2681.14s)]
*  You know, even he said even the most tough talking immigration hawk in the nation, he [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2684.42s)]
*  said at one point, he goes, yeah, it's tragic that we have to do this. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2690.7s)]
*  He goes, it's a tragedy. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2693.7s)]
*  This is how this is why it's so bad when you don't have a border. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2695.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, this is why it's so bad when you let people flood in illegally by the millions, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2699.22s)]
*  because now we got to round people up and kick them out. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2703.5s)]
*  And I got to say that to me, when I heard him say that, I go, that is a winning kind [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2706.42s)]
*  of compelling message, you know, that it's like, yeah, that's right. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2711.82s)]
*  We we quite literally in this case have to clean up the policies of the previous [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2715.38s)]
*  administration. And it sure does suck that that falls on us to have to do. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2720.7400000000002s)]
*  There's something about that that I thought was like, that's kind of hard to argue with, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2725.1400000000003s)]
*  because otherwise, if you don't accept that, then you no matter how much you're against [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2728.58s)]
*  the illegal immigration or you could say you're against it, your position is that once [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2734.18s)]
*  it happens, we just have to accept it. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2738.8999999999996s)]
*  Once it happens, it's like, OK, the demographic makeup of our nation has been changed [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2741.1s)]
*  by the last administration and we cannot change that. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2746.06s)]
*  We have to accept that going forward. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2749.02s)]
*  And that's going to be a tough sell. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2751.18s)]
*  That's going to be a very tough thing to convince anyone of, because it just be like, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2753.2599999999998s)]
*  well, no, we don't. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2757.06s)]
*  I mean, we have the legal tools to deal with this. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2759.5s)]
*  So why is it that you're just asserting it's incumbent amongst us to just accept that now? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2763.9799999999996s)]
*  And I don't that that just doesn't make sense to me in the same way that it never made sense [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2769.22s)]
*  to me that if there is a giant caravan of people coming from South America, that are just [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2773.9799999999996s)]
*  uninvited people that are not coming in through the legal process of our immigration system, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2781.18s)]
*  but they're just coming here. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2785.82s)]
*  Why is it that America has to accept them? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2788.54s)]
*  That just doesn't make sense to me. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2791.6600000000003s)]
*  It's like it's not it's like what under what obligation is the principle that America [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2793.5s)]
*  belongs to everybody in the world equally? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2798.7000000000003s)]
*  Because if that's your principle and yet only American citizens can vote in elections, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2802.06s)]
*  for the most part, it seems that you're going to lose elections to anybody who says, I [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2806.98s)]
*  think America belongs to the American people. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2813.1000000000004s)]
*  Not the world equally, which is by the way, essentially the core of Trump's message since [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2816.1000000000004s)]
*  2016. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2822.94s)]
*  And it's the reason why he's been president twice. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2825.3s)]
*  He's won two out of three elections, three out of three, if you ask Trump. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2827.98s)]
*  I'm not sure I'm with him on that. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2832.5800000000004s)]

*  All right, we got we got one more video here. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2912.9399999999996s)]
*  You want to play that one? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2915.06s)]
*  All right, Rob, well, I started the show saying that Democrats are searching for for [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2930.7s)]
*  their way to get out of this hole. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2946.8199999999997s)]
*  And and I think they found it. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2948.3399999999997s)]
*  So there we go. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2951.2999999999997s)]
*  That's good. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2952.7799999999997s)]

*  Jesus Christ. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2956.7s)]
*  I think not only they floundering on all the policies, they don't have a good salesperson [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2957.58s)]
*  for it. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2961.94s)]
*  And whatever marketing companies they're overspending money with, as you saw with Kamala [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2962.7s)]
*  Harris, I think she ended up her campus. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2966.58s)]
*  She spent the most money ever and then still ended up in debt and in part because they [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2969.18s)]
*  spent a shit ton of money on television advertising. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2973.18s)]
*  Who was even watching that? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2976.02s)]
*  And so whoever behind the scenes is going, oh, well, this will be fun. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2977.66s)]
*  This is how we get the kids back on our side. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2981.46s)]
*  It's with these goofy TikTok videos because they're looking at Trump and Trump just has [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2983.7799999999997s)]
*  that cool factor that they tried to whine him out of office with the dignity, dignity, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2988.1s)]
*  dignity, as if jumping in front of a camera like a, I don't know, a fourth grader could [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2992.7s)]
*  come up with something more creative than that and probably did on a school project [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=2997.86s)]
*  for TikTok. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3001.18s)]
*  This is that they're just floundering. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3002.2999999999997s)]
*  They're just trying to figure out how do we sell our message? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3004.18s)]
*  And apparently being the adults in the room includes jumping around and putting a what [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3006.9s)]
*  is that a tech and tag song? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3011.9s)]
*  I don't even know, but it's terrible. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3013.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's also like, isn't it funny because look, 2016, like Swarovski is a bigger nerd [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3016.5800000000004s)]
*  than us. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3023.46s)]
*  Swarovski, you really should have waited like at least 30 seconds. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3025.5800000000004s)]
*  So it seems like you Google that. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3028.5400000000004s)]
*  There's there's something funny because like, oh, OK, it's eight years, a little over eight [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3031.3s)]
*  years since Donald Trump won the his first presidential election in 2016. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3037.7000000000003s)]
*  And OK, eight years, especially in our current political environment, is a fairly long [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3043.7400000000002s)]
*  period of time, you know, in the 24 hour news cycle or whatever. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3047.9s)]
*  And a lot of stuff's happened since then. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3051.1400000000003s)]
*  But it's kind of wild when you zoom out that so much of the criticism of Donald Trump when [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3052.94s)]
*  he first came on the scene was that he lacks decorum. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3058.9s)]
*  He's not serious. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3063.7000000000003s)]
*  This is kind of immature. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3065.46s)]
*  This isn't presidential. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3067.5s)]
*  This isn't how important people are supposed to speak. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3068.9s)]
*  And then it's like you just get so quickly to a point where it's like, well, what are [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3071.94s)]
*  you guys do it like this does? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3077.2999999999997s)]
*  It seems like it's like an imitation of what 20 year olds do on TikTok or something like [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3079.14s)]
*  that. Like this is our man. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3085.8199999999997s)]
*  And it's also on top of that, just so unappealing, this kind of like serious women in [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3086.98s)]
*  pants suits doing cringy fucking like what what world are you living in? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3094.18s)]
*  Like, it's amazing that somehow the Democrats managed to hand Donald Trump the adult in [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3100.9s)]
*  the room persona. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3110.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3112.78s)]
*  Like somehow he actually does. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3113.42s)]
*  And this was the case. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3115.1800000000003s)]
*  It was one of the things that was so startling about this last election was that Donald [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3116.42s)]
*  Trump, when compared to senile Joe Biden or cackling Kamala Harris, seemed like the [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3120.98s)]
*  serious alternative. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3126.94s)]
*  Like at least this guy is here and he means business and he's got a little bit of an [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3128.82s)]
*  agenda and he's got some thoughts of his own. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3132.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's not just whatever some big corporate donor told them to say or whatever the [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3135.46s)]
*  popular thing at the moment is like he's got some ideas that just seems more serious than [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3140.58s)]
*  anything that the Democrats are putting up against him. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3147.34s)]
*  But my God, I just it's hard. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3149.98s)]
*  It's generally hard to even put into words how unappealing that video is. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3152.46s)]
*  There's just like a disgust impulse that comes from watching that. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3157.6600000000003s)]
*  They're like, what the fuck are you ladies doing? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3162.2200000000003s)]
*  Like, what drugs are you on that you thought this might resonate with anyone? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3165.7000000000003s)]
*  Is it seems like something that you'd like? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3170.1000000000004s)]
*  Like you're like adult children would be like digging through their parents' stuff and [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3173.3s)]
*  find a video from college when they did something like that. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3178.6600000000003s)]
*  And you go like the whole family laughs at it and they're like, yeah, it's pretty [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3182.0600000000004s)]
*  embarrassing in hindsight, but we were 20, you know, and it seemed cool at the time. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3185.86s)]
*  They're sitting members of Congress are doing this. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3190.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know, Rob, I don't think it's going to work. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3194.1800000000003s)]
*  I can't quite take what experience this was or what this archetype is, but I remember [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3198.34s)]
*  I'm going to call them the pedophile moms that instead of working jobs like to hang out [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3204.54s)]
*  at the school for the school plays or the school pictures, and even as like a third [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3208.1000000000004s)]
*  grader, they'd come up with some idea and you'd be like, yeah, I'm not doing that. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3212.6200000000003s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3215.58s)]
*  That's what this video feels like. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3217.1s)]
*  Yes, that is a very good way to put it. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3219.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3221.7s)]
*  The worst idea from the theater kid mom that did not go that route and is now, you [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3221.94s)]
*  know, doesn't work and shows up to the school to volunteer for these things and just [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3228.66s)]
*  has the worst idea so she could have her one moment in the director chair with three [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3232.98s)]
*  third graders, but even those kids are smart enough to be like, oh, this lady sucks. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3237.9s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3242.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like the thing. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3243.42s)]
*  It's like the thing like when you're a third grader and you have no real power, but [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3244.58s)]
*  it's like the thing that one of the like moms would suggest where you'd be like, I [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3248.62s)]
*  will run away. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3253.02s)]
*  Listen, I will run away. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3254.62s)]
*  Like if you make me do this, I swear I will run away. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3255.86s)]
*  I will go on hunger strike. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3258.1800000000003s)]
*  I will run away and I will never go to school again. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3259.54s)]
*  I cannot be seen doing this. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3261.7400000000002s)]
*  And they're like, no, come on. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3263.86s)]
*  It's cute. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3264.82s)]
*  And you're like, you don't get it. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3265.34s)]
*  You don't get it. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3267.1s)]
*  I cannot be seen doing this. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3267.86s)]
*  Like it's genuinely bad. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3269.66s)]
*  That's where the Democrats are at. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3271.98s)]
*  Um, it's look like the interesting thing here, right? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3274.42s)]
*  Is that in order, really in order for the Democrats to survive, in order for them to [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3279.2200000000003s)]
*  have political success in the future. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3284.26s)]
*  And this is boring. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3286.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, it's, it's hard to predict the future. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3287.38s)]
*  And, and the truth is that nobody at Donald Trump is not going to run again as, as scared [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3288.86s)]
*  as the Democrats are. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3296.02s)]
*  Uh, this is, this is his last term. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3297.42s)]
*  Um, there is nobody in line who has what Donald Trump has. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3300.18s)]
*  Now we'll see what happens over the next few years. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3305.62s)]
*  JD Vance has obviously risen tremendously in prominence. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3308.38s)]
*  Um, he is the sitting vice president now and he's doing a good job in moments like the [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3313.02s)]
*  moment with Zelensky and moments like with Dana Bash, where he's like showing that he [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3316.74s)]
*  can kind of, I can go to war with the, the people who you think of as the other side. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3321.06s)]
*  And so, but, but he's not Donald Trump. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3326.9s)]
*  You know, he has never demonstrated that he has a cult of personality following the [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3329.74s)]
*  way Donald Trump does. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3333.58s)]
*  He's never demonstrated that he has tens of millions of people who will go to war for [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3334.74s)]
*  him the way Donald Trump has. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3338.8599999999997s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3341.22s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3342.8199999999997s)]
*  Someone else has to rise up on the Republican side as well. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3344.14s)]
*  But it seems to me that almost what the Democrats need is to some degree, their [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3347.2599999999998s)]
*  own version of Trump. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3352.1s)]
*  And, and what I mean by that is not that they have to be anything like Donald Trump. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3353.3399999999997s)]
*  In fact, that is the complete wrong mentality. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3357.66s)]
*  I think that's the mentality that a lot of Democrats are almost like going with here. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3361.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, we got to find someone like that. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3364.5s)]
*  You know, it's like the day after the election, they go, we need our own Joe [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3366.18s)]
*  Rogan. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3368.74s)]
*  We need our own Donald Trump. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3369.58s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3370.94s)]
*  Joe Rogan didn't become Joe Rogan by trying to be anyone else's thing. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3372.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3376.7s)]
*  Like, it wasn't like he was going, Hey, we need the podcast version of Dan Rathers. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3377.2599999999998s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3383.46s)]
*  Like, that's not how these things happen. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3384.14s)]
*  And in fact, you know, like one of the things I was thinking of earlier is something you [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3386.14s)]
*  said that just reminded me of that. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3391.66s)]
*  But do you remember the, when Elizabeth Warren was doing that, that video in her [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3393.3s)]
*  living room and she's drinking the beer, but she drinks it in such a weird way that [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3397.18s)]
*  you can tell she does not usually have a bottle of beer, but like she's trying to [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3400.66s)]
*  do the like, and it's like that's the [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3405.02s)]
*  humor with the hamburgers when it was that he eats lizard food and he's never [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3407.86s)]
*  cooked a burger in his whole life. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3411.94s)]
*  Hey, it was like human just enjoying Memorial Day like the rest of you. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3413.94s)]
*  Cause it was a funny thing burgers with the grill that's off. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3417.34s)]
*  Well, it's, it's that it's not just that the grill was off, but it's that there was, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3422.38s)]
*  there was cheese over the raw patties. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3425.86s)]
*  And you're like, who's no one who's ever made a burger ever put a slice of [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3429.66s)]
*  cheese over a raw patty. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3434.42s)]
*  Like, that's just not how it's done. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3436.42s)]
*  It's a little intricacy. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3438.1800000000003s)]
*  I guess if you've never made a burger, it might take you a minute to be like, Oh, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3439.78s)]
*  okay. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3442.54s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3442.82s)]
*  But like, that's just not how it, you know? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3443.58s)]
*  And so there's little, but the whole thing is that it's like, their mentality [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3445.22s)]
*  is so off because they're so phony. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3448.9s)]
*  So they're like, even Elizabeth Warren drinking the beer, right? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3451.62s)]
*  She's like, Hey, well, I'm trying to talk to like workers. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3454.34s)]
*  You know what workers like is to have a cold beer after work. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3457.46s)]
*  And that is true, right? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3461.7s)]
*  Like it is true that beer is popular amongst the working class. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3462.7799999999997s)]
*  But look, Donald Trump just carried the working class vote and he's never had a [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3466.7799999999997s)]
*  beer. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3471.34s)]
*  And in fact, he'll openly say, I've never had a drink in my life. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3471.98s)]
*  That is not most Americans experience, but it really is Donald Trump's experience. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3475.06s)]
*  And so when he says that it just comes off as authentic, it's like, yeah, dude, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3481.9s)]
*  my, my older brother, who I looked up to killed himself with alcohol. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3485.3s)]
*  And I was just like, I'm never going to drink alcohol. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3488.98s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you're not just like trying to do the thing that is what [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3491.1000000000004s)]
*  they do, but you were just, you're, and then it's kind of like, Oh shit, that's [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3495.42s)]
*  an interesting part of Donald Trump. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3498.58s)]
*  Now it doesn't mean that that, that, you know, working class guy who enjoys a cold [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3500.1400000000003s)]
*  beer after work is going to stop having a beer, but it also, it was completely [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3505.86s)]
*  unnecessary for that. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3509.9s)]
*  So, so anyway, the point is just that what they would need on the democratic side is [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3510.86s)]
*  somebody who was outside of the CIA deep state system, who could work up enough [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3517.78s)]
*  popular support that they just take the party the way Donald Trump did, you know? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3527.02s)]
*  And so I essentially I'm saying there's no way for them to achieve what they want [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3532.9s)]
*  to achieve, which is maintain deep state control and work up popular support. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3538.02s)]
*  It's going to have to come from someone outside of that, who takes that away from [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3542.7400000000002s)]
*  them, in which case the Democrats could come back tomorrow. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3546.78s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWX907THmfg&t=3550.18s)]
