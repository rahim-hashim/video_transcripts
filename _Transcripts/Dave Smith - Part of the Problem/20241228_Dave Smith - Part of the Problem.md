*  Counting down the end of 2024 which has been a wild one [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=23.84s)]
*  Quite quite an incredible year, and I'm sure we'll we'll do some type [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=28.34s)]
*  I was just thinking about today the kind of part of the problem traditions [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=32.2s)]
*  so we got a we'll do an end of the year episode and then you know what we've done is a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=36.1s)]
*  Before January 20th, we got to do a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=42.42s)]
*  the legacy of Joe Biden [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=45.1s)]
*  Episode where we go over his presidency the highs and the lows so we got some fun stuff coming up [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=47.42s)]
*  I did oh and then of course we'll be on the road for all of 2025 comic Dave Smith comm to find all of me and Rob's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=53.42s)]
*  Road dates together and Robbie the fire comm for all of Rob's solo headlining shows [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=61.42s)]
*  Alright, so I wanted to talk about today. We're recording a late-night episode [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=67.9s)]
*  Wanted to talk about our boy the Vakram Swami [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=74.5s)]
*  setting the internet on fire as well as Elon Musk the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=78.26s)]
*  the headlines across [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=82.54s)]
*  all types of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=85.58s)]
*  corporate and independent outlets are about this kind of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=87.34s)]
*  friction in the broader MAGA movement where people are fighting over H1B visas and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=91.66s)]
*  American culture and so I thought we would come in and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  Kind of talk about some of that stuff because there is a lot to talk about there [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=101.98s)]
*  I sent you of a Vaprom is Swami's tweet Rob. I know you're big saved by the bell fan [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=105.30000000000001s)]
*  You were very offended [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=110.58s)]
*  deeply offended by that I did so I saw this tweet yesterday and I did I will say it I [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=112.86s)]
*  Thought it was interesting and it kind of made me think I did not entirely agree with it [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=120.18s)]
*  But I did I was like, oh, this is kind of an interesting thought-provoking [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=125.44s)]
*  Conversation that the vague is starting here and then all day today on Twitter. I've just seen people furious about it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  So I was like good good. I think it did its job. It started a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=136.5s)]
*  good conversation where we all yell at each other about who's a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=140.1s)]
*  Really MAGA or something like that any I don't know Rob any any thoughts [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=144.78s)]
*  we could start with the the vague tweet or do you want to maybe start with just kind of the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=149.7s)]
*  The H1B visas and the tension between the tech world and Trump. I'll let you pick where do you want to dig in first? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=154.82s)]
*  I have a lot on all of this, but we could start we could start with the visas [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=161.5s)]
*  I do think that there's something [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=166.06s)]
*  Fascinating that if I'm sitting down and I'm watching a basketball game we can understand [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=168.61999999999998s)]
*  Hey [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=172.98s)]
*  I'd like to watch the best players in the world and it's so important for me to be [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  Entertained and be able to watch the best players in the world that if you're the best in the world [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=177.66s)]
*  Well, we'd like to have you here [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  We'd like for you to be a part of our infrastructure of the NBA [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=183.42s)]
*  We want we want everyone to know that we've got the best league in the world [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=186.82s)]
*  so it seems like there's no problem getting a visa if you're a pro athlete or an entertainer and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=189.94s)]
*  You're in the category of best in the world [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=195.78s)]
*  It makes no sense why for every other profession we wouldn't extend the exact same courtesy [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=198.17999999999998s)]
*  Why would I want the best in the world to be somewhere else working for somebody else if the best in the world? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=204.5s)]
*  Want to come here and work for our companies and participate in our economy? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=209.73999999999998s)]
*  Who on earth is saying no to that and if you're already gonna accept that it's kind of true of every single job [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  No, there is there's no question that there is logic to that and I think it's an important thing that there's look I [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=221.14s)]
*  Want to go through this because I actually I do see several different angles to this [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=228.61999999999998s)]
*  I agree with what you're saying and I think it's one of the things where [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=232.42s)]
*  there there is a tendency to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  Oftentimes on the populist right there's a tendency to like downplay the importance of economics [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=241.33999999999997s)]
*  And I think that that's a really dangerous game to go down. I believe like as Ludwig von Mises said that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=247.46s)]
*  Economic laws exist whether you recognize them or not [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  The analogy in my mind is kind of like if you were saying hey, I don't I'm not interested in paying attention to gravity [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=259.38s)]
*  It's like okay [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=265.74s)]
*  But if you're jumping out windows you really better factor gravity into this because it's it's that force exists [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=266.74s)]
*  Whether you like it or not and it's a very important one [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=272.78s)]
*  I think it's easy for people in the dissident right [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=275.54s)]
*  particularly in today's environment in in America with what America's been for like let's just say the last ten years but probably the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  Last 30 or last 50, but it's very easy if you're in the dissident right to feel like no [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  There's something that's more important than economics [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=291.06s)]
*  There are things like like culture and tradition and the nation and because these things have been so under attack [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=293.18s)]
*  It's easy to feel like well the economic stuff doesn't really matter as much but but my point is just don't fall into bad thinking [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=301.5s)]
*  And I think that's the point you're kind of making to rub [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=309.62s)]
*  It's like look if this applies here as we can all say it does then logically [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=312.46s)]
*  well, let's just at least think about this and I see this a lot when it comes to the arguments for protectionism and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=316.82s)]
*  there's kind of I [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=324.26s)]
*  Don't mean to be offensive but there is from my perspective a little bit of like a dumbing down of the rhetoric [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=326.5s)]
*  where it's almost given that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=332.58s)]
*  American jobs equals good and foreign jobs equals bad and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=336.38s)]
*  There's never like any accounting for the fact that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=341.94s)]
*  Look, it is true that if we outsource a steel plant [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=345.94s)]
*  The people who worked at that steel plant have lost American jobs and those jobs go overseas or something like that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=351.02000000000004s)]
*  But if they are producing the steel for much cheaper and many more people are buying the steel in America [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=356.98s)]
*  Then we're working at the steel plant that a lot more people have benefited from this transaction [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  And you can downplay that all you want to you can say I'd take American jobs over and and and live with the higher prices [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=368.06s)]
*  But I would just say consider what higher prices have done to people over the last few years [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  How many families have been destroyed over the price inflation? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=379.85999999999996s)]
*  Stated differently if I'm in the backyard at a barbecue at some guy who's in the let's say the pavement construction [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=383.74s)]
*  Whatever Union out of New Jersey. I'm like man. That's awesome [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=390.14s)]
*  You make 250 grand a year and you work nine to five you rule [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=393.86s)]
*  That's so cool that you have this job and then guess what every time I'm on a road and it's got some pothole in it [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=397.02s)]
*  Or it's got construction that's going on for three years and causing traffic [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=402.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm like why the hell can't government get me better roads? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=405.62s)]
*  And so that's that's kind of the unintended consequence of I of the protected union jobs is yes [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=409.14000000000004s)]
*  It's great for every single person that can have one of those [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=416.18s)]
*  But for every single person that wants to use these goods and services and it's overwhelmingly expensive such as the subway your education [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=418.66s)]
*  Everything that sucks and if you just start to understand economic growth [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=426.18s)]
*  Well if we can consume all these things for less than we'd have I mean, it's just economic someone lessens [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  I'd have more money to spend elsewhere doesn't that just allow me to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=434.78s)]
*  Consume more and I know everyone consume consume consume but that's all jobs. That's all things that I want. That's called economic growth [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  That's called putting money where I actually want to spend it [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=445.14s)]
*  Which then indicates to someone what they should be providing to me. This is all autistic talk for economic growth [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=448.97999999999996s)]
*  But I just a part of the reason why I think it's it's because I'm a very [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=454.74s)]
*  But I just a part of the reason why I think it's and by the way [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=457.70000000000005s)]
*  I've even if people disagree with what we're saying here just like hear us out and and there's I have other thoughts on [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=460.70000000000005s)]
*  This matter as well, but it's it's also part of this is that that type of stuff [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=467.5s)]
*  It's not [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=473.54s)]
*  economics [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=475.54s)]
*  When you really think about what economics is [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=476.86s)]
*  Economics is like the study of human action or human action [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=479.98s)]
*  toward you know [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=485.38s)]
*  improving the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=487.46s)]
*  Your your quality of existence or something like that this it's [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=488.98s)]
*  It's not separated from other issues that are very important [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=494.14s)]
*  So like even when you talk about like like let's say you're like a real right-wing dissident or something like that or you're [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=498.56s)]
*  You're a very [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=504.65999999999997s)]
*  very conservative [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=506.5s)]
*  That when you're talking about that type of economic growth when you're talking about making the average American [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=508.5s)]
*  Richer you're also talking about creating an environment where [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=514.5s)]
*  Young men can afford to start a family [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=519.98s)]
*  You know what I mean where they can afford to maybe have their wife not need to go out and work and she can stay [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=523.1s)]
*  With the kids there are other effects that like the idea of taking like cultural issues over here and economic issues over here is always [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=528.02s)]
*  A flawed way to look at the world. So it's not just like for its own sake. We like prosperity and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=535.38s)]
*  Harmony and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  Conservative culture kind of I think all go hand in hand in my opinion. I [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=545.3000000000001s)]
*  do think that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=550.02s)]
*  There's maybe if there was more I want to get into on this end because there is okay. I'll say this right [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=552.7s)]
*  There is make man [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=558.62s)]
*  Maybe this has partially been kind of the evolution in my thinking over the years and and a lot of the stuff we're talking [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=560.26s)]
*  About Rob like up till now is kind of there it is standard libertarian stuff [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=566.6600000000001s)]
*  But I think it's important and I still believe all of that. I will say though in addition [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=571.26s)]
*  there the h1b visa thing has become at least in the way it's used like a bit of a scam and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=577.42s)]
*  part of what that is is that there's it's kind of sold as [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=587.14s)]
*  Okay, these are the elite of the elite and of course, we want to get the best in the world of that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=593.66s)]
*  And so they say you think like, okay [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=598.5s)]
*  Well, look most people will grant that we're kind of better off if we have like you use the example of the NBA [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=601.4000000000001s)]
*  But most people would probably grant like surgeons and engineers and like some very important jobs [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=607.86s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, if we can snag the absolute best guy in the world, you can see where yeah [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  That's that's better for our nation than not getting them [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=618.02s)]
*  I think most people see that and then they kind of sell that but then they use it to fill up a lot of like [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=621.22s)]
*  80-90 thousand dollar a year jobs and companies get tax credits for hiring through the h1b [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=626.98s)]
*  Program and so I can understand where like if you're an American citizen and you're like, hey [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=634.46s)]
*  I'm forced to fund this government organization and all of this stuff [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=639.82s)]
*  Why is it unreasonable for me to say the priority should be me over? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=644.7s)]
*  Foreigners like in other words like why would you why would the policy not be that we give tax credits for hiring Americans? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=651.02s)]
*  instead of tax credits for hiring [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=658.38s)]
*  h1b visa [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=661.3399999999999s)]
*  Applicants so I do think there is a point there like I you know what I'm saying [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=663.38s)]
*  Like does that make sense right or I had not the it shows a shown my education on this one [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=667.78s)]
*  I didn't realize that there was a tax credit scam element to this. Yes. And so yeah, obviously that makes zero sense whatsoever [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=672.8199999999999s)]
*  That government should be incentivizing you to hire a foreign worker [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=680.06s)]
*  But if a foreign worker is better skilled and willing to do it you kind of have two separate problems here [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=684.7399999999999s)]
*  You got problem one, which is it is [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=689.5s)]
*  Gloriously stupid to want to keep the elites in other places. Like I don't know if I would you go [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=692.4599999999999s)]
*  Hey Einstein that guy's gonna compete with an American physicist. Let's leave him in Germany. I don't know was he originally in Germany [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=698.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm just coming up with an example here. Yeah, I think so Germany. I think so. Yeah, but the point [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=704.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to make is if you have absolutely elite brilliant people that [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=709.8199999999999s)]
*  managed to claw their way out of third world countries and show off their [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=713.74s)]
*  Exceptional skills and knowledge and they might be the key to your engineering team making breakthroughs [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=718.18s)]
*  The idea that you wouldn't want to recruit those people makes zero sense [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=724.14s)]
*  And then there's a separate conversation just about all foreign labor that you are like [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=727.9399999999999s)]
*  would you just rather the jobs go to other places because manufacturing is cheaper and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=732.52s)]
*  What that looks like of just basically having minimum wage laws having union jobs and outsourcing all [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=737.5s)]
*  labor to other areas because it's too expensive to do here they're kind of you see what I'm saying like they're almost [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=743.62s)]
*  Even though obviously we're gonna go for freedom on both sides because we know it works better [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=749.34s)]
*  But they're kind of two separate categories [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=754.18s)]
*  But the idea of government coming in with an incentive to specifically recruit foreign labor [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=757.14s)]
*  I mean that makes that makes no sense [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=761.66s)]
*  Right and and there is something where I do think when you look at all of these [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=763.5s)]
*  things all of these different areas whether we're talking about [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=769.26s)]
*  you know [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=773.62s)]
*  Factories going overseas jobs going overseas [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=776.02s)]
*  Immigrants coming in and and taking jobs any of these topics [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=780.58s)]
*  One of the things that just is always overlooked and I do think to some degree [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=786.06s)]
*  This is why the vax tweet which we'll get into in a second drew such [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=790.9s)]
*  Criticism from some people and why it was it really wasn't well received among a lot a large group of people [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=796.66s)]
*  And I think part of that is that? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=803.14s)]
*  There's just in in all of these examples the American worker is just constantly like [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=806.34s)]
*  Carrying the weight of our government on their back [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=812.5s)]
*  It's just oh that like they have to carry the weight of the entire [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=816.14s)]
*  God damn world empire the whole those [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=821.22s)]
*  730 bases that we have all around the world every proxy war we're fighting every [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=825.02s)]
*  entitlement program everything that the largest government in the history of the world and you know [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=830.14s)]
*  Demands is on the back of the American people they're carrying this whole corrupt mess on their back [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=835.38s)]
*  And then people come along and go okay, and we're gonna subsidize [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=841.14s)]
*  Someone else over you and our concern is someone else over you and you know what I mean? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=845.9s)]
*  I'm like there's just like a snapback reaction [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=851.0999999999999s)]
*  But you know when you think about the jobs being outsourced the government has made it so [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=853.64s)]
*  Enormously expensive to produce and hire in America. You know it's like the American worker doesn't even have a fair [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=858.18s)]
*  competition against any of these guys and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=864.9799999999999s)]
*  That's another [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=868.38s)]
*  Factor in all of this and and you know I [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=870.4599999999999s)]
*  Do understand [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=874.34s)]
*  Where people look at a system and go like why wouldn't the thought have been to have huge tax credits for hiring American workers? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=876.6600000000001s)]
*  Why would the thought of bit you know and by the way I also think in some of this stuff a lot of the people are [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=884.6600000000001s)]
*  Talking past each other because I actually I'm not sure that the vague rama swami or Elon Musk would disagree with that [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=890.34s)]
*  I know the vague has said several times [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=896.4s)]
*  He thinks the h1b program should be gutted and totally remodeled and stuff like that and he is big on [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=898.42s)]
*  Meritocracy, that's what he's been pushing that to me [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=904.78s)]
*  there's a [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=908.8199999999999s)]
*  Lot of there's fair points all around there, and there's competing interests [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=910.3s)]
*  But we shouldn't pretend like any of them don't exist [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=915.62s)]
*  I don't think we should pretend that like there is no that that it's so clearly self-evident [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=918.26s)]
*  That it's better if there's like some freaking genius, and they don't come to America like when we're talking okay that that's you know [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=924.9399999999999s)]
*  What I mean something worth now if you're talking about [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=932.28s)]
*  the fact that these companies are manipulating the way this thing is sold in order to like [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=934.5799999999999s)]
*  Make it cheaper for them to hire someone foreign than hire an American [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=941.54s)]
*  And that does seem to be the case quite often with these h1b visas [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=946.3399999999999s)]
*  That is a totally reasonable thing to be appalled by and to wish to abolish [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=950.7800000000001s)]
*  One of the other interesting angles here [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=959.86s)]
*  Okay, there's a couple things number one. There's also been a fair amount of [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=962.74s)]
*  investigative reporting and research that's been done on big tech companies [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=968.1400000000001s)]
*  discriminating against conservatives over the years [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=973.22s)]
*  And turning away people for different reasons so in other words like this their line of [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=976.74s)]
*  Like well, we just need this work, and we can't get it anywhere else [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=983.74s)]
*  So we have to import it is seems kind of like a dubious claim [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=987.14s)]
*  But there's also this weird dynamic in the tech world where the tech world was obviously as we all know in [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=990.74s)]
*  In many ways over the last few years Rob has not just been [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=998.94s)]
*  mortal enemies of [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1003.22s)]
*  Everybody who was critical of the regime, but also in many ways are our most devastating [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1005.22s)]
*  Foe you know like the big concern for people in our world over the last few years [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1011.94s)]
*  Has been like tech censorship and the fact that all these big tech companies that we kind of rely on in order to spread [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1016.5400000000001s)]
*  our our you know our [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1022.7600000000001s)]
*  content [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1025.42s)]
*  All of these companies were kind of against us and then something dramatically new happened where Elon Musk came in bought Twitter [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1026.78s)]
*  All of a sudden supporting Donald Trump became like the cool thing to do and a lot of these tech guys now even you know [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1034.5s)]
*  Zuckerberg's over there being like no I want to be part of it now [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1041.42s)]
*  And so it's this weird dynamic where you now have a movement the broadly speaking the MAGA movement [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1044.38s)]
*  Where there are kind of like okay? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1051.14s)]
*  They just allied with these tech guys [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1052.86s)]
*  Donald Trump for whatever reason and some people have some wild conspiracy theories about this [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1055.3s)]
*  But Donald Trump his supporters were not really silenced in mass during this election [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1059.86s)]
*  That's a huge part of what allowed him to win is that we they didn't have anything like the hunter Biden story where it was [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1065.6599999999999s)]
*  suppressed and people were shut down or any of the stuff through kovat and [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1071.82s)]
*  Now you kind of have this group of people who [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1077.5s)]
*  They want their little pet thing and their pet thing is this h1b visa program [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1082.82s)]
*  and they like that they can hire a whole bunch of people that aren't American who [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1088.4399999999998s)]
*  who will do the job for cheaper and [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1093.8999999999999s)]
*  They they like this thing that they've got it also involves [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1098.3s)]
*  You know it's kind of inherently in conflict with the MAGA movement because it's a kind of like oh [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1101.8999999999999s)]
*  We want people from other countries to have these jobs not America [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1106.82s)]
*  And that doesn't jive very well with the America first mindset [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1109.94s)]
*  And then you've also got a dynamic [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1112.9s)]
*  Personally where a lot of these people in MAGA world know some of these people in the tech world and they're like oh you ruined [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1115.04s)]
*  My friend's life a few years ago over some bullshit [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1120.44s)]
*  So it's just interesting to see that whole dynamic like in the background of all of this [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1123.54s)]
*  All right, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add in there or we could maybe move on [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1131.22s)]
*  To [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1137.82s)]
*  Good I do [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1139.82s)]
*  I was just thinking this as you're talking and this is not libertarian [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1141.4199999999998s)]
*  But I just I'd be curious to know if I guess they were forced to [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1144.96s)]
*  Hire more Americans if they could make that work [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1149.1s)]
*  Like is it really that Americans don't have the skill set or that there's no price point at which it's profitable [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1153.02s)]
*  To be hiring these people. I'd love to hear a little bit more information about [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1159.06s)]
*  Why exactly it is that foreign workers when it comes to these engineering jobs are such better fits or [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1163.64s)]
*  Why they need them in order to be? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1170.44s)]
*  Globally competitive or as to what you know [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1173.3600000000001s)]
*  Because I've had jobs that I wasn't qualified for when I got there [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1175.92s)]
*  But there was actually good training and I learned and they you know, they needed to staff people and so I ended up with [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1179.14s)]
*  The job there so it there is I guess there's also a slightly missing storyline here to me [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1185.3200000000002s)]
*  What's wrong? I mean kids are spending 50 grand a year to get college educations [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1193.46s)]
*  I think there's kids every single year that are leaving colleges without you know [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1197.3400000000001s)]
*  Without jobs. I mean you're telling me that that the entire tech industry can't can't build a single [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  College or post college two-year training system that gets these kids ready for the jobs that you're looking to staff [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1208.1000000000001s)]
*  They're there. There also just seems to be something [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1213.78s)]
*  Slightly missing in the storyline here of why are people from abroad so much more [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1216.26s)]
*  Competitive in these positions or [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1221.06s)]
*  Americans so unwilling to work like what what there seems just to be something missing in this storyline here [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1224.02s)]
*  Which could just be same as foreign labor when it comes to you know building a little chachkar whatever else [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1230.82s)]
*  They're just willing to work for so much less than what we're willing to accept here [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1235.3s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's it. That's a good transition into the vakes tweet because he kind of I mean this he he gives some [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1239.62s)]
*  Ideas about what he thinks some issues in American culture are [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1247.74s)]
*  And I don't agree with all of them [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1251.6200000000001s)]
*  But I think it's an interesting conversation then and I think you just raised some of those kind of important questions [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1254.96s)]
*  But so here let me uh [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1259.92s)]
*  Let's pull up the Vivek tweet [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1261.82s)]
*  I'll read it [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1264.58s)]
*  Hold on one second okay the vague Rama swami writes the reason top tech companies often hire [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1266.66s)]
*  Foreign-born and first-generation engineers over native Americans isn't because of an innate American IQ deficit a lazy and wrong [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1273.18s)]
*  Explanation a key part of it comes down to the c-word culture tough questions demand tough answers [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1281.74s)]
*  And if we're really serious about fixing the problem we have to confront the truth our [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1287.66s)]
*  American culture has venerated [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1292.8600000000001s)]
*  mediocrity over excellence for way too long at least since the 90s and likely longer [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1295.06s)]
*  That doesn't start in college it starts young a culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math Olympiad [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1300.8200000000002s)]
*  Champ or the jock over the valedictorian will not produce the best engineers a culture that venerates [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1307.6200000000001s)]
*  Corey from boy meets world or Zack and Slater over screech and saved by the bell or Stefan over Steve Urkel in family [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1314.02s)]
*  Matters will not produce the best engineers fact [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1321.96s)]
*  I know multiple sets of immigrant parents in the 90s who actively limited how much their kids could watch those TV shows [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1324.94s)]
*  Precisely because they promoted mediocrity and their kids went on to become wildly successful stem graduates [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1332.18s)]
*  We more move could we pause for a second sure sure sure go ahead [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1339.1000000000001s)]
*  There's just two interesting things about this first is and I think it's something we're all aware of there used to be an old [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1343.38s)]
*  saying of uh [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1348.66s)]
*  Like something about be will be careful bullying the nerds because I'll end up being your bosses [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1349.74s)]
*  and I think there's something that every American somewhat aware of and what he's describing only exists through high school because [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1354.74s)]
*  Those kids that don't necessarily fit in your high school because they're particularly bright [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1361.6200000000001s)]
*  They'll go on to Harvard [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1365.94s)]
*  They'll go on to MIT and then once you're in college there kind of admits other people who want to be excellent [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1367.3s)]
*  And so what he's describing is kind of grade school in high school [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1373.56s)]
*  And I think people are aware of it and the kids that [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1377.3s)]
*  Do you want to excel go on to those places and then they exit from the stupidity of American high school culture? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1380.46s)]
*  Of which I was a participant [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1387.46s)]
*  I I spent I spent most of my high school not showing up drinking and smoking and it was a lot of fun at [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1389.1s)]
*  The time and you know, but somewhat regret it now because uh, you know, I could have learned I could have learned a little bit more [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1393.82s)]
*  with that's with that said I can only speak for the [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1400.18s)]
*  That the Jewish culture I was raised in and I can tell you that I my peer group definitely [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1405.22s)]
*  outperforms culturally like if I if I were to list my my ten synagogue friends and [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1412.34s)]
*  I mean of my ten synagogue friends [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1417.3s)]
*  I think there's four multi millionaires and the rest of them are you know high performing CPAs [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1419.98s)]
*  I can't tell you how much cultural pressure there was to work hard [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1424.98s)]
*  Which is in part because we get married at age 24 25 once again [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1428.8600000000001s)]
*  I got to be that age and that wasn't in the cards for me. So I stopped keep I was like I'm out of this [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1432.74s)]
*  I'm I'm done with this virgin shit and I'm not getting myself a good job [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1436.74s)]
*  But if you wanted to exit like kids didn't fuck around in college in the same way [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1440.54s)]
*  It was a different culture that you were trying to have a job and get married [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1444.98s)]
*  that was the way that that worked and our parents worked incredibly hard and the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1448.38s)]
*  Education was really important and there was kind of a hey [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1453.3s)]
*  We're not fucking around type attitude that when I mingle [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1456.3s)]
*  With people from other demographics. They did not have the same pressure from their parents [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1460.06s)]
*  To work their asses off or a fear of money or a fear of being unsuccessful [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1466.26s)]
*  And what the consequences of that of what what that looks like? Yeah, I mean those things are [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1472.26s)]
*  look, they're enormously important and I [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1478.82s)]
*  I don't exactly agree with the vague here [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1482.7s)]
*  In my opinion, I think he's missing the mark a little bit when he talks about these TV shows and I don't and I mean [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1486.26s)]
*  That it's not like I'm like I really am offended by the saved by the bell [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1492.3s)]
*  So but I actually I don't think there's anything wrong with like [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1495.18s)]
*  Kind of lionizing AC Slater or Kelly Kapowski or something like that [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1498.74s)]
*  It's like that they were like the beautiful and successful athletes and they're that's also a meritocracy of its of its own [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1503.44s)]
*  and I think that [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1511.26s)]
*  One of the things that people kind of got to remember with this is that look obviously the vague is talking about these things [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1513.46s)]
*  from his perspective and [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1518.34s)]
*  The vague is and I mean this I I really like the guy I consider him a friend [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1521.42s)]
*  so I just but the vague is like [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1525.02s)]
*  in [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1527.46s)]
*  Indian nerd brilliant guy, you know what I mean? Like that's his perspective who's like [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1528.54s)]
*  literally been like wildly successful and is like got a great like just like a gifted child who probably my guess is [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1535.1s)]
*  Had like fairly strict [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1543.54s)]
*  Parents who kind of you know, like I mean look we all what he's talking about in the 90s as he mentions there [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1546.18s)]
*  You know knowing people from these immigrant backgrounds. I mean, I know I knew some like Indian and other Asian [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1551.34s)]
*  cultures Korean [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1558.54s)]
*  couple Asian a [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1560.9s)]
*  Couple other Asians I think and [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1563.94s)]
*  I [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1566.26s)]
*  Knew a couple Indian kids who's yeah had I mean like they just you know [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1567.74s)]
*  They live in a different type of culture even much different than what you're talking about Rob, you know [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1573.78s)]
*  It's like tiger mom shit like it's you know what I mean? Like they are like they are [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1577.94s)]
*  Getting straight A's in school anything less than straight A's is unacceptable. They're doing every extracurricular activity [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1584.8600000000001s)]
*  They're playing violin they're doing all of this and they're like [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1591.9399999999998s)]
*  For their for fun. Maybe they're like allowed to read fiction or something like that, but they don't hang out with the other kids [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1594.78s)]
*  They're not out at night. They're not do they come now [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1600.74s)]
*  Personally, I would never push my kids like that. It's just not my values. It's not my culture [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1603.62s)]
*  It's I don't agree with it. I don't think it actually it certainly produces very successful kids a lot of times [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1610.6599999999999s)]
*  I think I don't know that it produces like critical thinkers and genuinely at peace kind of [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1619.14s)]
*  Joyful people and personally, I very much believe in like really just loving your kid [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1627.82s)]
*  I'm like a hippie when it comes to parenting like a right-wing hippie a good right-wing hippie [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1634.3s)]
*  But I'm like a hippie when it comes to this shit. I really I believe in peaceful parenting [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1638.58s)]
*  I believe in showering kids with love and just giving them like a childhood a nice foundation [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1642.46s)]
*  But okay, I do also believe in like really trying to stimulate them intellectually [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1647.26s)]
*  I really do believe in like, you know [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1652.98s)]
*  reading and play based like interactive education, I really do and [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1655.9s)]
*  So look, I'm not saying that anyway long way long ramp short [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1662.6200000000001s)]
*  I guess I don't necessarily agree with the vakes examples and I don't think the answer is necessarily that we need to embrace like [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1666.42s)]
*  Orthodox Jewish culture or [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1673.3400000000001s)]
*  Asian or Indian culture any type of tiger mom shit [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1675.8999999999999s)]
*  But I think almost anyone if we're being honest you'd at least have to admit that like yeah [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1679.1799999999998s)]
*  No, there are major problems in American culture [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1684.62s)]
*  And if we at least like maybe there's a happy medium [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1687.6599999999999s)]
*  Medium between like not having saved by the bell and having kids who could read at grade proficiency [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1690.8999999999999s)]
*  That might be a you know what? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1696.98s)]
*  I mean like that is a reasonable thing to expect and there's certainly at least truth to the fact that [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1698.62s)]
*  Just in our own American culture, you know [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1704.74s)]
*  Like I feel like almost if the vague didn't say it this way and he just said something about participation [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1707.2199999999998s)]
*  Trophies a lot of right-wingers would have agreed with him because that's just like their [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1712.1799999999998s)]
*  Buzzword and they'd have been like, yeah, that's the side we're on but like, okay, that's just one example [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1716.4199999999998s)]
*  But yeah a nation of participation trophies. This is like totally like become the norm in this country and that's not good [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1720.4599999999998s)]
*  We're not at all encouraging the idea in in young people that you should strive to be great [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1727.2199999999998s)]
*  by the way, I [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1734.4599999999998s)]
*  Much less of a problem with the show is you know [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1736.1399999999999s)]
*  Putting the head cheerleader and the star jock out there than I do [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1739.34s)]
*  You know having putting like the disabled obese trans person out there or something like that [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1743.1s)]
*  So I'm okay with some traditional standards of beauty [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1747.4199999999998s)]
*  but I don't know any other anything else you want to add rubber should I go back to a [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1750.6599999999999s)]
*  To read the end of the tweet [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1756.06s)]
*  I also just kind of feel like you know, not all the jobs are gonna go the way of the math nerds [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1757.4199999999998s)]
*  Maybe that's somewhat trendy right now, but like I don't know. There's something there's something for everyone else to do [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1761.5s)]
*  Like there I'm just saying there's a winning spirit to the people that aren't the fucking math nerds [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1768.54s)]
*  They'll end up in sales jobs. They end up in management positions [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1773.14s)]
*  They end up like there's a lot of other jobs out there that uh, the the cooler kids can find I don't think I don't think [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1776.18s)]
*  The fact that people some people don't gravitate towards the math and sciences [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1783.54s)]
*  is that necessarily [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1787.7s)]
*  Indication that they'll permanently be without employment or that uh, you know trying to gear [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1790.1000000000001s)]
*  I I just can only speak for myself school was not a very rewarding environment for me [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1795.22s)]
*  I certainly did not enjoy my time there [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1800.66s)]
*  and I didn't make good use of it because I felt like I was forced to be there and I wasn't able to [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1804.3400000000001s)]
*  control my day my schedule or [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1808.46s)]
*  Follow what I find interesting. There wasn't a lot of opportunity to grow what I'm good at and what I like to do [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1810.74s)]
*  So the school was a very punishing environment that for 24 years. I thought I was an idiot and I was pretty miserable [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1818.38s)]
*  so, you know, I also just don't really [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1824.5400000000002s)]
*  know that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1828.14s)]
*  championing more math or making that cool and trying to make that the thing that we all compete in is necessarily [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1829.46s)]
*  In 20 years where all the jobs are gonna be and and what what's gonna help people? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1836.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean what I would say is that we need in many ways like a reimagination of education in general [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1841.5s)]
*  This is something I've been saying for for many years, but I really do [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1848.18s)]
*  you know, I [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1852.5800000000002s)]
*  if you if you're very conscious of this stuff and you [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1854.98s)]
*  Make money and you have a bit of money you can you know get your kids good educations in this country [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1859.46s)]
*  I don't mean to say you can't but there is something where like we really do [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1865.5s)]
*  I and I think the whole school system was designed to do this and you know [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1869.7800000000002s)]
*  Get into my whole you know the whole rant about how it's adopt the Prussian system that we adopted but [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1874.56s)]
*  I'll skip that but the kids are naturally very curious and into learning and I do think that school in general ends up [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1880.24s)]
*  suppressing that [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1889.48s)]
*  much more often than it encourages it and and [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1891.32s)]
*  Particularly for people who are not conformists and there's something about the schooling system [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1894.8400000000001s)]
*  Which again is what it was designed to do was to create conformists [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1900.6399999999999s)]
*  That you know if you're very good at memorizing and regurgitating and reading the thing that you didn't really want to read [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1905.9199999999998s)]
*  But that was assigned to you and that's and and you know answering back what the teacher wants to hear from you [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1911.84s)]
*  You end up doing very well in school [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1916.54s)]
*  But if you're kind of like an outside the box [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1918.08s)]
*  Person you tend not to not to mention just sitting still I'm an adult. I'm 36 [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1921.56s)]
*  Sit down for the show I sit down when I'm on a plane [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1927.6399999999999s)]
*  I literally have a standing desk and I'm moving around constantly [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1930.0s)]
*  Yeah, the idea that when I was eight years old I had to sit in a seat or at 13 [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1933.28s)]
*  I had to sit in a seat. Oh, no, maybe that's a great point, dude [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1939.3999999999999s)]
*  Just that just that bias alone that like you're biased against people who maybe just don't want to sit still for her [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1942.48s)]
*  It's a great point and the fact yeah, and the fact that you'd be expected to do that when you were fucking seven is just insane [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1948.96s)]
*  Yeah, an excellent excellent point. All right. Let me read the rest of a vakes vakes post here [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1955.08s)]
*  Okay, he says wait. Sorry more movies like whiplash fewer reruns of friends more math tutoring fewer sleepovers [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1961.28s)]
*  More weekend science competitions fewer Saturday morning cartoons more books less TV more creating less chillin more [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1969.44s)]
*  Less chillin more extracurriculars less hanging out at the mall most normal American parents look skeptically at those kind of parents [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1976.72s)]
*  more normal American kids view [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1985.32s)]
*  View such those kinds of kids with scorn if you grow up aspiring to normalcy normalcy is what you will achieve [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1987.92s)]
*  Now close your eyes and visualize which families you knew in the 90s or even now who raised their kids according to one model versus [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=1995.52s)]
*  The other be brutally honest normalcy doesn't cut it in a hyper competitive global market for technical talent [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2002.28s)]
*  And if we pretend like it does we'll have our asses handed to us by China. This can be our Sputnik moment [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2008.48s)]
*  We've awakened from slumber before and we can do it again Trump's election [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2014.44s)]
*  Hopefully marks the beginning of a new golden error in America [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2018.2s)]
*  but only if our culture fine fully wakes up a [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2021.04s)]
*  Culture that once again prioritizes achievement over normalcy excellent over mediocrity [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2024.84s)]
*  Nerdiness over conformity hard work over laziness [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2030.8s)]
*  That's the work we have cut out for us rather than wallowing in victimhood and just wishing or legislating [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2034.32s)]
*  Alternative hiring practices into existence. I'm confident we can do it [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2040.84s)]
*  so [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2046.3999999999999s)]
*  Look, I there were a lot of people who objected to what Vivek was saying to to be clear. I do think that [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2047.9199999999998s)]
*  he [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2055.36s)]
*  Kind of answered back with some people who were like, oh, well we used to have that in America [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2056.6400000000003s)]
*  Why can't we have that now? He's like, yeah, I totally agree. That's my point [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2060.84s)]
*  We should have that now [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2063.36s)]
*  so I do think there were some people who are kind of they were missing his point or kind of talking past him but [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2064.2400000000002s)]
*  To his final to his final point there [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2069.8s)]
*  My my whole thing with this is and I would say when he does connect it there to hiring practices [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2073.6800000000003s)]
*  Although again, it's not as if he said that's why we shouldn't touch [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2079.08s)]
*  H1b visas or something like that and he's gone on to clarify that that's not his position [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2084.08s)]
*  so actually, let me let me say this and then we get back to the system this I will say that I [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2088.36s)]
*  Think a lot of people also because the vague is Indian. He's American, but he's Indian American [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2094.2s)]
*  I think a lot of people did take this kind of like as an outsider criticizing our culture or something like that [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2100.22s)]
*  I don't know if that's fair. I mean Vivek was born here. He grew up here [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2105.68s)]
*  I think he's talking about the country he lives in he ran for president. He's a very influential very successful American [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2109.9s)]
*  He has a right to give his opinion [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2116.26s)]
*  And I don't think it's fair to view him as an outsider [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2118.1800000000003s)]
*  Look I'm not saying I completely agree with him it you have to admit Rob [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2122.26s)]
*  It's hard at least from my perspective [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2126.54s)]
*  It's hard to take too much offense to someone being like [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2129.3s)]
*  Yeah, if kids were spending a little bit more time reading it a little less time hanging out at the mall. That's probably better [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2133.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay, I can't really argue with that now that being said I do think I think there's actually quite a bit of a balance to life [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2139.66s)]
*  I do believe in like that kids enjoying their childhood particularly early childhood, but there's there's a point there for sure I [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2146.7s)]
*  think [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2155.14s)]
*  fear and humility forces people to level up and [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2156.22s)]
*  I know my most successful friend was a was a stupid goofball same as I am and [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2159.66s)]
*  He realized at one point that his dad he didn't have a dad his dad is out of the picture and he realized [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2165.94s)]
*  He didn't have the same safety net as I as the rest of us [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2170.96s)]
*  And so he outworked all of us and he's more successful because of it [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2174.1000000000004s)]
*  And I know sometimes in my own life when I'm getting it's like the old boxer thing [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2177.86s)]
*  It's hard to get up and train when you're in your in your fine linen sheets or whatever. I think in America [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2181.7400000000002s)]
*  we've got a lot of [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2187.46s)]
*  You know a lot of socialism here [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2190.2200000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of protection and there is a culture of hey [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2192.14s)]
*  I'm just supposed to have a bunch of things even if they're unearned and I think having you know [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2195.46s)]
*  What I mean, I feel like there's almost not enough realization for hey, it might not be that easy to get a job [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2201.32s)]
*  Hey, like you know what? I mean, I think if already by high school [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2206.7s)]
*  You're realizing how hard you're gonna have to work in order to maybe have a house and maybe and and start really working towards [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2210.62s)]
*  Those goals as opposed to drinking through college or whatever else and thinking things are magically gonna work out [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2217.9s)]
*  I do think the [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2223.5s)]
*  Fear I think fear is what kind of drives people to be more responsible [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2225.6600000000003s)]
*  I know in my life [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2229.86s)]
*  I was a really I was a dumb person for a really long time and I did a lot of drinking not that I don't [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2230.94s)]
*  Drink now, but I definitely did and I didn't think there was gonna be any consequence [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2236.26s)]
*  And then when he gets a consequence of oh, I don't have a job and I have no employable skills [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2239.46s)]
*  And I don't know where to go from here [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2244.14s)]
*  I had to start living a more disciplined life because I I confronted the consequence of that [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2246.06s)]
*  So I think where he's not wrong and I know that this was true of at least the Jews [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2251.5s)]
*  I was around there were people that survived the Holocaust and they came here and they realized they had the fear of the universe of [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2257.62s)]
*  Holy shit. I better be successful life is scary and I know of my grandfather [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2264.14s)]
*  He survived the Great Depression and being poor was the scariest thing in the world and he got into [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2269.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2276.34s)]
*  he got into [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2277.06s)]
*  Brown and Yale against Jewish quotas at the time and he created a different life and he lived a very disciplined lifestyle [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2277.82s)]
*  because he was afraid and I so I think I think there is a [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2283.7000000000003s)]
*  lacking for the fear of oh there aren't just gonna be jobs for me unless I'm like [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2288.98s)]
*  Globalizations here we're competing against the rest of the world for jobs [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2295.5s)]
*  You got more and more people that are gonna and like there could be economic growth [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2298.5800000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2302.02s)]
*  So like there's new opportunities down the line that don't exist now [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2302.94s)]
*  but I do think we probably are culturally too lackadaisical and I do think he's a [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2306.1800000000003s)]
*  Heat he's hitting on something here. All right guys [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2311.3s)]

*  whether you're [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2364.24s)]
*  You know a socialist and you kind of like blame things on capitalism or if you're [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2366.72s)]
*  Even I've seen this with libertarians and you blame things on the government or if you blame things on the Jews [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2374.3199999999997s)]
*  Or you blame things on whoever it is [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2379.4s)]
*  There's always a risk [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2382.64s)]
*  when you're doing that that you're gonna fall into kind of like a victimhood mentality and [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2385.0s)]
*  Start blaming your problems on other people and sometimes that might be true [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2390.8s)]
*  You know like there's I've seen it a lot like of on socialists online [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2395.6s)]
*  Where they'll kind of be like a [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2402.6s)]
*  You know [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2404.7999999999997s)]
*  They'll just be like these like kind of like democratic socialist guys who've you know [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2405.36s)]
*  I've like a little bit of a following and they're like asking to borrow money from a friend there [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2408.92s)]
*  I need 200 bucks or blah blah blah [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2413.16s)]
*  I can't get to work tomorrow because this goddamn capitalist pig is gonna fire me if I don't do blah blah and you're you [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2415.12s)]
*  Know and you're like look maybe it is but like you could be kind of correct in some sense [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2420.44s)]
*  Maybe your boss is really a jerk and maybe like you do have a legitimate gripe with someone [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2425.36s)]
*  But it's also hard to not sit there and be like hey you're an adult [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2430.0s)]
*  How do you not have $200 put aside? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2433.36s)]
*  You know like how you there's your your part of this equation if you're an able-bodied man [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2435.36s)]
*  Who's in his 30s and you don't have $200 put aside your at least up? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2441.14s)]
*  And so you could see where it's just it's a dangerous thing to fall into that like victimhood mentality [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2444.84s)]
*  That also doesn't mean you might be not be right like your boss might be a dick or something like that [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2451.08s)]
*  So I would just say I think my advice is I think people should be [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2455.72s)]
*  You want to find a way [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2463.4399999999996s)]
*  Where you're not too fragile to be able to hear something like this from the vague and shut down [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2465.7599999999998s)]
*  This is a reasonable point that he's making it's a reasonable topic and I think kind of an interesting topic to approach [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2470.8399999999997s)]
*  And the people who are coming in pretty hard like I don't from my perspective the fakes earned the right to like give his opinion [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2479.08s)]
*  on some fucking things and [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2484.94s)]
*  So I I don't have anything against that [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2486.58s)]
*  I would say that when it comes to his last point about the hiring practices [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2489.34s)]
*  I think it's reasonable for Americans to go. Okay, we hear your point [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2493.08s)]
*  There are certainly ways that our culture has been degraded [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2496.8s)]
*  particularly over the last 20 30 years [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2500.78s)]
*  Also, let's take a look at this system and make sure it's not rigged against the American people [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2504.18s)]
*  I don't think it's too much to ask that the American people who have to fund this entire system [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2508.82s)]
*  Ask that it's not rigged against them and it seems like in almost every single [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2513.8999999999996s)]
*  System that you could think of in the United States of America today [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2518.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like rigged against average Americans [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2522.06s)]
*  And so I do also understand that and I do also understand Americans having a little bit of a feeling of like hey look [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2524.62s)]
*  you know [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2531.4199999999996s)]
*  Like there's a fair [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2533.62s)]
*  counterpoint to like the tiger mom argument and the counterpoint might be something like [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2535.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well the thing about our country is that our [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2540.58s)]
*  Unifying principle here is liberty [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2545.02s)]
*  That's been the idea of America from the beginning and when you have liberty [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2547.86s)]
*  It does produce a little bit of a different characteristic or you could argue the [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2552.9s)]
*  characteristic produces the liberty or the culture produces the liberty or the people produce it or whatever but [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2557.7400000000002s)]
*  Maybe we don't maybe even in America in the 1950s or 1960s [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2565.26s)]
*  Maybe we didn't push our kids quite as hard as like the tiger moms did but it also did kind of create the society that [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2570.42s)]
*  You guys are immigrating to now [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2577.9s)]
*  Like we're not the ones trying to go over to your society [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2580.58s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2583.7000000000003s)]
*  like there is something to be said for like well maybe this cult this culture of freedom and all of that is why you [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2584.5s)]
*  Want to now come over and this culture of like economic [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2590.1800000000003s)]
*  Development and growth is why you want to come over now and [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2593.98s)]
*  Push your kid to go be an engineer in America rather than stay in your country and for what I understand [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2597.2200000000003s)]
*  We're not as lazy as the Europeans you always hear about their I've been told [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2602.84s)]
*  Coffee in the afternoons and just shutting down their stores and all their stupid horse shit [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2606.78s)]
*  So we don't go to we don't go on no siesta [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2611.1000000000004s)]
*  We fill up a triple X tub of soda and take it to our cubicle [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2613.7000000000003s)]
*  Our right through lunch we still got some hard workers here and a winning and a winning spirit [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2618.94s)]
*  I always think it's funny sometimes in the Olympics where you see [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2623.94s)]
*  like I [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2627.1s)]
*  Don't know. It's like I almost call it like cowboy attitude where you see [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2628.46s)]
*  You see more like in the winter sports with like the American like skiers and snowboarders [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2632.58s)]
*  And they just seem like a bunch of lazy uncaring goofballs [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2637.02s)]
*  And then they're against these and what seemed to be like highly [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2640.7799999999997s)]
*  Disciplined samurai Japanese people and then a lot of times we completely kick their ass [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2645.26s)]
*  But then you see the way that these people train and you know, they're they're putting their work in so I don't know [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2650.3s)]
*  I feel like we still got a winning spirit [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2655.7400000000002s)]
*  But like we're a little bit a little bit wilder with it, which I think comes with risk-taking and that's also why we win [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2657.86s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean I I agree and I think that there's I'd like to see a world where like [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2665.26s)]
*  Look I [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2673.4599999999996s)]
*  Should say it like this. Okay [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2676.06s)]
*  The as as me and you have both been pretty clear [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2678.1s)]
*  For many years at this point now the immigration policy in this country is just it's [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2681.74s)]
*  disgraceful and [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2688.7799999999997s)]
*  Borderline suicidal. I mean it's just been particularly during the Biden years, but for many years before that [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2690.8599999999997s)]
*  It's just it is it is insane [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2696.4199999999996s)]
*  To have a country where the dominant [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2700.0s)]
*  cultural ideology is [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2704.7999999999997s)]
*  Essentially one that condemns it the [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2708.12s)]
*  their own nation as [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2713.12s)]
*  essentially what we are is a history of slavery and segregation and racism and patriarchy and bigotry and [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2716.0s)]
*  Stokes racial grievances [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2724.7999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile you're bringing in a million legal immigrants a year [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2726.96s)]
*  vast the vast disproportionate majority of them [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2732.0s)]
*  Being you know not white so essentially [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2736.6000000000004s)]
*  Changing very drastically the the cultural and racial makeup of the country while at the same time you have woke progressives [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2741.4s)]
*  Constantly trying to stoke racial and tribal flames [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2748.28s)]
*  Then on top of that you have a giant welfare state [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2751.8s)]
*  This is totally like the the people of the country have never gotten a say in this never gotten a vote in this the property [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2754.44s)]
*  Owners of the country are completely disenfranchised and then on top of that you have just [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2760.92s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in every single year. We really have no idea exactly how many there's no accounting for them [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2766.96s)]
*  We don't know how many are here. There's there's an insane [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2773.2000000000003s)]
*  immigration system currently [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2776.12s)]
*  It's one and it's of course it policy wise the primary reason why Donald Trump has been elected twice [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2778.32s)]
*  But there is [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2784.44s)]
*  So I've said for a while that I think it's crazy that [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2787.04s)]
*  the American people have no way of exercising any type of [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2792.1200000000003s)]
*  influence or control over this immigration system and [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2798.1600000000003s)]
*  But this is something different [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2802.56s)]
*  I mean when you're talking about the h1b visas again granting that it's a total scam and it's totally [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2804.1200000000003s)]
*  Sold as one thing and then used in a different way and it is there [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2809.6s)]
*  The system is pitted against the American people and that's totally unfair and it should be changed [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2813.08s)]
*  But you are talking about like eighty thousand [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2817.32s)]
*  I think people a year come in from this it's it is kind of small peanuts in the larger immigration conversation [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2820.52s)]
*  just saying like just the numbers of it and [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2827.84s)]
*  There's at least when we're talking about like skilled immigrant labor. There's a much different debate that should be happened [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2831.0s)]
*  That's that's a totally different thing than like just a hundred thousand migrants pouring into your country who are all gonna be on welfare [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2837.36s)]
*  immediately that is like a different conversation to have and [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2843.88s)]
*  Even for people like us who recognize that open borders are insane that this current immigration system is [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2847.36s)]
*  Unsustainable and dangerous and as I said somewhat suicidal [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2854.96s)]
*  You can still understand where I would want like I want in America where? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2859.1200000000003s)]
*  There can be a sane immigration system and we don't have anything like this and I'm even open to arguments because I have heard [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2864.8s)]
*  Some fairly persuasive ones that we should essentially have very very limited even legal [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2871.8s)]
*  Immigration at this point that it should be super super legal [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2878.2400000000002s)]
*  We've taken in so many people that we kind of have to close for a while and allow for like a bit of a melting pot [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2880.56s)]
*  and then you will see what can happen in terms of deportations and but that's [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2887.32s)]
*  That's very messy and gonna be very difficult logistically to implement [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2892.72s)]
*  At least on on large levels, but I've I can even get that argument [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2898.2s)]
*  I can get all of that [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2902.8199999999997s)]
*  But I would want to live in a world where we could have a sane immigration system [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2903.6s)]
*  Maybe even a very restrictive immigration system, but also [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2907.44s)]
*  The American workers wouldn't be so insecure that they'd be real worried about [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2911.72s)]
*  Foreigners coming and taking their jobs that also we we would just be killing it so much that you'd be like [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2918.04s)]
*  I'd like to see one of these guys from this third world country even try to come take my job because I'm so skilled and I'm [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2923.68s)]
*  So competent and so at least part of this conversation like we could rail against the immigration stuff, too [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2928.92s)]
*  But then part of this conversation should be like why have the American people also been so failed by this system that they're not [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2935.0s)]
*  In that position but they're not like in that position where they are just so competent and so good at their job and we have such [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2942.6s)]
*  a like a [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2949.7200000000003s)]
*  Positive and prosperous culture that we are just out competing the world at all of this stuff because that should be I think what we [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2951.8s)]
*  strive for [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2958.8s)]
*  anyway [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2960.16s)]
*  Probably comes down to the Fed and that the larger companies have more access to capital and so it's too hard to [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2961.44s)]
*  Just you know get in there and compete and so [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2967.08s)]
*  Maybe that's why I guess the workers in the world are going hey you guys have rigged this and we're gonna need those jobs [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2970.68s)]
*  So, you know, you're not giving them to foreigners [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2975.96s)]
*  Well, I will say the other the other thing that I would just kind of caution people to be skeptical about is that I or [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2979.0s)]
*  Question the media skeptical [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2985.36s)]
*  I just I would kind of ask people like think about all of this stuff and think about everything that's going on here [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2986.48s)]
*  And even if you're kind of like on the other side of this issue from the vague or from Elon Musk or something like that [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2992.84s)]
*  There's look there's been obviously a [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=2999.0s)]
*  Tremendous concerted effort over the last few weeks [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3002.64s)]
*  To try to get from and I mean from the corporate media from the powers that be to try to drive a wedge between [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3006.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and Donald Trump [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3012.6s)]
*  This is it's been reported in all of the major newspapers that Elon Musk is the real [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3015.08s)]
*  President and they know what they're doing and they're this one was actually a little bit clever [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3019.72s)]
*  I think they got Trump to respond to it a few times like that is Rob [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3023.08s)]
*  If you want to drive a wedge between Trump and somebody is you start publishing that you know [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3027.08s)]
*  He's got the biggest dick in the room [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3032.16s)]
*  Not Donald Trump because you know Donald Trump is gonna have to come back and be like my speaker [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3033.68s)]
*  It's a big it's actually pretty tiny. It's average at best [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3038.32s)]
*  You know and like so it like and and then that is a way to because all these guys are kind of alpha guys in their [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3042.08s)]
*  Own way and so then that causes the Elon Musk to be layer [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3048.16s)]
*  Why is he up there saying I got a tiny dick when I gave him 100 million dollars? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3050.8s)]
*  I've seen this movie before I know how this goes in general. I've predicted this [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3054.3199999999997s)]
*  Since well before Donald Trump won I've said if he gets back in there [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3062.24s)]
*  Here's the issue is that you go in there you end up getting a handful of decent people around you [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3065.4799999999996s)]
*  Then you get a lot more just establishment guys [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3071.9199999999996s)]
*  That's already been true in the Trump [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3074.9599999999996s)]
*  Movement, right? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3077.52s)]
*  And then what happens is they start targeting the good people one by one by one [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3078.88s)]
*  And start kind of edging them out getting them out of the way [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3083.36s)]
*  And all I'm saying is that you got these two guys the vague Rama Swami and Elon Musk these two [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3086.88s)]
*  very intelligent [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3093.28s)]
*  Very capable guys who have been put in charge of this brand new thing [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3095.76s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to do it [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3100.4s)]
*  I'm [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3102.48s)]
*  Very capable guys who have been put in charge of this brand new thing which is like [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3104.48s)]
*  Designed to kind of attack the power source of the entire corruption in this country [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3110.56s)]
*  Like you want to you want to really make some enemies in Washington DC start talking about cutting two trillion dollars out of the budget [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3116.08s)]
*  That's that's how you make some enemies and the the biggest factor [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3124.48s)]
*  in the [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3129.84s)]
*  The whole system being pitted against the american people is how giant the government is [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3132.2400000000002s)]
*  That's the whole thing is that economically the american people have to carry the weight of the global empire? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3136.4s)]
*  and frankly [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3143.36s)]
*  Entitlement programs for boomers who wrecked this whole thing [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3145.42s)]
*  that's quite frankly, that's really the [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3149.28s)]
*  The most of it is that the boomers set up a system where they just extracted all the wealth out of the most powerful [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3151.92s)]
*  Country in history of the world and spoons in our mouths [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3158.08s)]
*  Yeah told the next generations that they were so privileged that they got to live in their parents house that went up by 800 [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3161.04s)]
*  or something like that and um [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3168.16s)]
*  Made you know left a system where they handed the next generation nothing but debt and war [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3170.4s)]
*  and chaos [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3176.08s)]
*  and [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3177.84s)]
*  Yet somehow they've worked it out where their social security and medicare will be covered by everybody else and they're just they're all [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3178.72s)]
*  Retired on their pensions now and [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3185.76s)]
*  The american worker has to carry this whole thing. So then you have elon musk and Vivek ramaswamy come around and [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3189.92s)]
*  they're talking about cutting massive amounts out of the the [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3196.4s)]
*  Budget they've also said things about how the pentagon isn't off limits. You want to really make some enemies in dc [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3200.96s)]
*  That's what you start talking about cutting the pentagon [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3207.76s)]
*  and now all of a sudden there's a major campaign to like [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3210.7200000000003s)]
*  Remove these guys screw these guys. It's like, you know a lot [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3214.96s)]
*  I see a lot of magga people being like we don't need them. They need us [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3218.16s)]
*  type attitude and it's like [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3221.68s)]
*  Listen, that is just not entirely fair to say about elon musk [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3223.92s)]
*  Elon musk played a vital role [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3228.0s)]
*  In getting donald trump elected vital, uh financially in terms of uh, um [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3231.44s)]
*  Communication there's no one bigger than him buying twitter and a account in there the ripple effect that that had and also just um [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3239.02s)]
*  Culturally, it's like been a huge force [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3247.74s)]
*  So I would you know, i'd be pretty hesitant to like throw these guys under the bus over this [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3250.3999999999996s)]
*  Over them having look there's there's obviously gonna be [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3257.2799999999997s)]
*  I think in this world in this alliance with like the tech bros and donald trump [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3261.2799999999997s)]
*  There's going to be some conflicts of interest and this quite possibly is one [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3266.16s)]
*  And so I don't think they should get a fair system an unfair system [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3271.12s)]
*  That rigs it against the americans and lets them hire gives them tax credits to hire cheaper foreign labor [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3275.2s)]
*  i'm, not saying I support that [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3281.36s)]
*  um, but at the same time it's kind of like [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3283.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's the way it's going to be anytime you align with some businessmen [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3286.72s)]
*  There might be things that are in their interest that they're going to be like well [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3290.0s)]
*  We do kind of like this one car about i'm just saying [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3292.3199999999997s)]
*  Again, I think a lot of people are disagreeing with the vague and elon in good faith. I'm just saying like I [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3296.0s)]
*  I'm, not ready to throw the two people who are like really making the issue of cutting government spending [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3302.08s)]
*  At the central focus again. I'm not ready to cut those guys loose [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3308.3999999999996s)]
*  And I don't think the rest of maga should be either if they're smart about this. That's that's my opinion [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3312.16s)]
*  With all that said the optics aren't great. I mean if you're elon musk you should have played it as uh, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3317.3599999999997s)]
*  For the next two years, I need more foreign workers [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3322.64s)]
*  But i'm opening up this university and i'm hoping to staff this many americans by this point in time [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3325.2799999999997s)]
*  Or we're going to do this to get the americans prepared for the jobs. I need a staff [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3330.7999999999997s)]
*  Or if you give me this i'm going to do this much amount of american labor [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3335.12s)]
*  But I think uh american first and american jobs are kind of top of mind [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3339.6s)]
*  So particularly before trump even gets in having a conversation of uh, hey I I need for my industry foreign workers [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3344.0s)]
*  Which by the way, I think the reality of the situation is that's uh, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3351.76s)]
*  Every every american corporation would probably prefer cheaper foreign labor and if they could staff up [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3355.84s)]
*  Uh, you know the illegals that came over the border and there's a conversation to be had there of the uh, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3361.2000000000003s)]
*  Wealth that could be generated if every corporation, uh, you know ends up with cheaper foreign labor and that maybe we all win from it [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3366.48s)]
*  but yeah the optics of uh of of you know, america first and then [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3373.76s)]
*  Given out given out a piece of the pie to foreign workers for just the guy who helped you get in it's not great [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3378.5600000000004s)]
*  It's not great [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3384.96s)]
*  I think and that's up [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3385.84s)]
*  There was a real problem with the optics of the vape's tweet also and I think that's part of the reason why it wasn't well received [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3387.1200000000003s)]
*  um with a lot of people however, I do think that like [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3392.48s)]
*  all of these [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3396.8s)]
*  all of these issues are things we're gonna have to um grapple with and I do think that [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3398.5600000000004s)]
*  much like [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3404.48s)]
*  you know much like with the [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3406.64s)]
*  The fight over the woke, right? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3410.08s)]
*  Kind of this this fight there's this is just like there's something about it. That's human nature where [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3412.3199999999997s)]
*  The you know, the the woke left just took such a shellacking [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3419.6s)]
*  You know like they just got beat so bad that they're kind of like demoralized and down and out and then [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3424.7999999999997s)]
*  It's almost it's such a human nature thing that the next thing to happen is that this coalition that came together to beat them [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3431.52s)]
*  Starts finding things to argue about with themselves and I don't think that's necessarily an unhealthy thing [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3438.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't like [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3444.4s)]
*  I I always think that um, and maybe this is like the old school liberal in me talking [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3445.84s)]
*  But I always think that like it's a good sign if a lot of these like issues are being [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3451.76s)]
*  Hotly debated and it's a bad sign [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3457.92s)]
*  When people are kind of shrieking and talking past each other and just lobbing insults without grappling with people's arguments [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3461.44s)]
*  so it's I just think like these things should be debated and they should be talked about the the [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3469.2799999999997s)]
*  you know [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3474.56s)]
*  Support for israel should be something that's like hotly contested [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3476.3199999999997s)]
*  On the right wing in america and support for [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3481.54s)]
*  H1b visas is something that should be hotly contested like all of these things are um [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3485.14s)]
*  You know, obviously I my feelings are pretty known on most of these things [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3491.22s)]
*  But like these are like important fights to be had they're not meaningless things [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3494.58s)]
*  And so I do think it's like it's not the worst thing in the world that these topics are being brought up [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3498.98s)]
*  And I do think even while I don't completely agree with the vakes tweet [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpykqpq4DRQ&t=3503.7s)]
