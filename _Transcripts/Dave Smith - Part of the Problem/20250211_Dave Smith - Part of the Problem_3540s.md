**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs)
*  Hello, hello, what is up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the fire Bernstein. How are you today, sir? I'm doing well. How [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=12.68s)]
*  are you Mr. Smith? Ready for that debate tonight? Yep, getting ready. I hope I'm ready because [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  I don't have too much time. I can't be like, I got to crack a few books. At this point, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=23.68s)]
*  I know what I know. Another head for the mantle. That's what you need. You need someone to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=28.88s)]
*  make prosthetic heads that you can hang over your forest fireplace. Well, you know, one [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=33.12s)]
*  of the things that's interesting. So for people who don't know, I'm going after the show today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=38.32s)]
*  I'm headed over to Princeton University. I'm going to be debating Josh Hammer, who is the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=42.48s)]
*  he's a senior editor at Newsweek. And I don't know too much about him. I've I read like [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  a couple articles that he's written and I listened to two speeches that he gave. He [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=54.04s)]
*  seems like a smart guy, like, you know, and like a worthy debate opponent. And so, you [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=59.26s)]
*  know, we'll see. And it's one of these things. The debate is over the the US Israeli relationship [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=66.12s)]
*  and whether it's positive for America or not. And one of the things by the way, for people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=72.8s)]
*  I know, Natalie, I'd mentioned that someone had asked in the live chat and it will be [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=78.88s)]
*  streamed. It's going to be live on YouTube. I could find the I'm blanking at the moment [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=83.32s)]
*  on the name of the group who's putting this on. Sorry, I probably should remember that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=87.64s)]
*  I'll remember them by the time I get there. Isn't that sure, sure, sure. Yeah, that perfect. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=91.04s)]
*  By the way, Natalie just said if you didn't hear off Mike, she will include the link in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=96.56s)]
*  the episode description. But, you know, but this really is my as you've come to know over [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=99.84s)]
*  the years. Yeah, that's a good point. OK, anyway, well, you know what? But it'll it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=104.6s)]
*  won't be the live stream then, but it'll be up on YouTube. But if you've worked with me [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=109.36s)]
*  for years, you know, I only learn names like once I get there. It's always five minutes [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=113.04s)]
*  before we get there. I figure out how to say or after we say it on the podcast, a whole [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=117.76s)]
*  bunch of everyone gets mad at us. Yeah, but even then I keep saying it wrong. Yes, that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=121.84s)]
*  is a part of my process. Sure, Rob, if you want to be. But anyway, so it's a steamboat, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=126.08s)]
*  I believe. Am I getting that right? Yes, the Steamboat Institute are the ones they're [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=132.32s)]
*  they're putting on the event and it's at Princeton University. One of the things that's weird [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  about these debates, particularly over the topic of Israel, although I don't think it's quite as [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=143.6s)]
*  unique to Israel as some might make it out to be. You know, I've over the years. And I think this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=152.08s)]
*  is really part of how me and you have built this show up and how I've kind of built my following [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  is that I'm just OK. Obviously, I'm biased when I say this, but I'm pretty consistently [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=164.64s)]
*  right about the most important thing when it really matters. So like, you know, in the same [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  way I was not right. You know, I don't even exactly remember. Like, I don't know if I had [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=175.27999999999997s)]
*  a strong feeling about it, but I wasn't like the war in Iraq. I was too young to like know what the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=182.48s)]
*  hell I was talking about. And I didn't like have a show or anything. So I went. But just for an [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=189.68s)]
*  example of like the war in Iraq, everybody's against it now. You know, but like what really [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=194.72s)]
*  mattered is whether you were for it or not at the time. And me and you have just kind of consistently [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  been on the right side of all the like being that all of our takes, not all of our takes, all of our [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  takes on the most important issues aged very well. You know, but I like I was in the middle of, you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  know, I was on Joe Rogan show arguing against lockdowns in 2020 and calling them totalitarian. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=217.84s)]
*  And that was like now if I say, oh, the lockdowns were totalitarian, it's like the emotion is gone. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  So it's kind of hard to argue with who could argue that a lockdown isn't totalitarian. Like, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=231.6s)]
*  by definition, isn't that what it is? You are locking people down and deciding whether or not [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=235.36s)]
*  they can do anything. Anyway, the war in Ukraine was a big one. The COVID Vax was a big one where [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=241.12s)]
*  there are just these issues that are like super emotionally charged. But Israel's up there. It [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=250.32s)]
*  might be the most, you know, but it certainly is one of them. And so when you go into these debates, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=256.64s)]
*  it's especially with someone I don't know, like Josh, I really like I'm going in just to argue [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  the position and have like a civil exchange of ideas. But I'm not sure you know, you go in in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=269.28s)]
*  the back of your mind where I'm like, I don't know, this guy might I have to be prepared for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=274.4s)]
*  the fact that like, this guy might come at me, you know, on some like you're a self hating Jew, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  like whatever, you know, I just don't know enough about him. From the little I've seen of him, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=283.52s)]
*  I don't think he will. My guess is he's going to come in and debate the issue. But you never know [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=287.2s)]
*  with that. So it's a little bit of a weird like, you know, it's like, like, I'm fine with it being [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=293.68s)]
*  like a vicious fight. And I'm fine with it being a battle of ideas. It's a little weird not knowing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=298.72s)]
*  which one you're going to go into. If he starts calling you a self hating Jew, you should just [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  whip it out and go, I love that I don't have foreskin. You see this college today for this [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=308.24s)]
*  debate. That's your advice. Yeah, me. Not even. Yeah. All right. I will take that into consideration. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=315.04s)]
*  And I'm re questioning whether you're the best advisor to have. But somehow Rob is my senior [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  advisor. Look at this and tell me you you think I hate being Jewish. Well, it is I also I'm just [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=328.32s)]
*  kind of interested to see. Because I don't think Princeton was ever like really the the hotbed of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  any of the kind of protests or anything like that. Like, I don't know. I might be wrong enough not to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=343.44s)]
*  protest. Well, just like we'll go make money and not do stupid things. Well, I mean, Columbia is [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=347.92s)]
*  a pretty prestigious school, too. And that's where I don't know why they are. Is Princeton people [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=352.56s)]
*  smarter than we're like the fruitcake smart kids. If you're a fruitcake smart kid, you go to Columbia. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=357.76s)]
*  And if you're just, hey, I want to go make some money. Smart kid. You know, like Warden or [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=362.72s)]
*  Princeton, you should work for Princeton, dude. That was the best cell ever. I'm you know, I was [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=366.56s)]
*  just going to go there and tell them you all wasted your money on tuition. You're listening to me like [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=372.0s)]
*  engineers. MIT. If you're a little more fruitcake, you might try for Harvard or Brown. You see? Yeah. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=375.84s)]
*  And if you just want to like drink other dudes piss, you go to Yale. Everybody knows that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=382.08s)]
*  Skull and bones, baby. It's the Ivy League fruitcake deletion. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=387.84s)]
*  But anyway, it's it's it's an interesting place to be. It's interesting to to be in a debate about [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=392.88s)]
*  these kind of like polarizing white hot issues and even particularly with the, you know, I guess [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=401.52s)]
*  the thing is, like I when I went on, probably the most like pushback I ever got was when I went on [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=410.88s)]
*  Rogan's podcast and and talked about the war in Ukraine the first time. And because the war had [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=419.44s)]
*  like it was going on for a few months already. But the war was like in the it was still in the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=425.44s)]
*  like at this point, you know, the propaganda about how Ukraine's going to win is kind of gone. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=431.12s)]
*  Now it's kind of like what deal are we actually going to get? But back then it was like, no, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  we're taking back Crimea. We're doing the whole thing. I got so much. It was like it was like [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=438.72s)]
*  kicking a hornet's nest, you know, like the swarm that came after me, which I find kind of interesting [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=444.8s)]
*  in its own way. The thing about Israel, I guess, is that Israel somehow always maintains that status. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=450.0s)]
*  It's always the third rail. Like it doesn't matter if it's, you know, obviously it's been [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=457.6s)]
*  more so over the last year and a half. But Israel at all times, it's like if you even start talking [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  about, say, like the Israel lobby, people already kind of look at you like, oh, what are you saying [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=467.68s)]
*  that the Jews run everything and that there's this, you know, conspiracy. But you're like, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=474.0s)]
*  yeah, but how would you not talk about that? Like how does it you know what I mean? It'd be like if [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=477.68s)]
*  you were like talking about whatever if you were talking about gun control and you brought up the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  NRA, no one like looks at you like what a crazy thing to introduce into this conversation. You're [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=487.2s)]
*  like, obviously that plays a major role in how all of this works. No matter what side of the issue [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=492.08s)]
*  you're on, whether you're for gun control or against gun control, no one would like deny that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=496.88s)]
*  the NRA is a factor in there. And so it's just there's just a lot of strange kind of dynamics [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  to the debate. And it'll be interesting. I have no idea what the crowd makeup is going to be like [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=507.28s)]
*  or what side they're going to be on. It's an Oxford style debate. So you're kind of hoping the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=511.68s)]
*  crowd isn't all on your side. It's more to your advantage if there's more people who are against [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=515.52s)]
*  you because then you got more people you can pull over. So like like with an Oxford debate, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=520.48s)]
*  if 100 percent of the crowd agrees with you, you can't win. It's literally right. Like it's [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=525.6s)]
*  impossible to win. There's no one that you can persuade. And all the other guys to do is persuade [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=531.76s)]
*  one person and he gets the win. So it's kind of like it works against you if the crowd is on board [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=535.76s)]
*  with you. Anyway, it'll be it'll be interesting. And I'm looking forward to that. I'll be curious [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=540.96s)]
*  to see if there's any noisy protesters or any real elite college professors just standing on the side [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  with I should be in there. Why is this guy? They do. The thing about it is this is the you know, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=552.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't think there'll be protests, sweater vests and just holding a vanilla folder for no reason. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=560.64s)]
*  Well, there is a there's an inherent kind of bias against people like me in colleges, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=565.28s)]
*  understandably, you know, because it's like the fact that I've like tonight will probably be the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=574.4s)]
*  most time I've spent at college. And so they're like it's it's kind of in a way somewhat of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=582.24s)]
*  an inherent critique on the institution for me to even be here in this debate. And so, you know, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  there's no question that like college professors, this is I've made a lot of enemies over this [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=599.28s)]
*  dynamic in my career. But there is something where like there are there are people who are [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  products of institutions tend to not like when somebody is not a product of an institution [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=613.28s)]
*  and rises to have more influence or has a seat at the table because they feel like, hey, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=620.48s)]
*  I this is why everyone at Cato hates me. You know what I mean? Like Cato, if people don't know, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=626.24s)]
*  is like the biggest libertarian think tank. And all of them hate me. And you would think inherently [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=630.4s)]
*  you'd be like, well, here's a guy who's kind of popularizing your message, maybe not exactly the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=636.72s)]
*  same as your message, but pretty close, a lot closer than most other people. But when you're [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  when you've been at Cato for 15 years and you've, you know, moved up the ranks and played the game [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=647.6s)]
*  and kissed the asses and then finally got the approval and now you are their senior immigration [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=655.44s)]
*  studies person. Yeah, you don't like that some shit talking comedian just gets to, you know what [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, like lap you in this game. And so I do I do think with professors in general, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  there's just a dynamic like that. I mean, I don't know if you've ever seen but like, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=673.84s)]
*  Charlie Kirk does a lot of those things where he goes to college campuses and like argues with the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=678.08s)]
*  kids. And it's it's amazing how many times they'll bring up the fact that he does that he dropped out [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=683.2s)]
*  of college and like think that that's like, you know, you didn't even go to college, you didn't [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=691.76s)]
*  even graduate like they just they're stuck in that mentality of like, this is what matters. And then [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=696.64s)]
*  you're like, Okay, fine. I mean, he didn't graduate college, but he's fucking running circles around [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=702.08s)]
*  you in this debate right now. So that's more of a comment on you than it is on him. You know, it's [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  anyway, we'll see. We'll see how it goes. Should be fun. I always enjoy doing these things. Okay, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  let's, let's get into some stuff here. And then we'll couple couple things that are going on that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=721.44s)]
*  I wanted to talk about. And then I do I had a bit of a message for the Libertarian Party that I [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=728.08s)]
*  thought I would do at one point in the show. And then maybe we'll check in if we have time and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=733.04s)]
*  take some questions from the chat. So the big talking point today, that's circulating around, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=737.2s)]
*  I haven't seen a good compilation video of this yet. But I know it's only a matter of time until [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=745.2s)]
*  Tom Elliott has a good one. But it's constitutional crisis. We are in a constitutional crisis, Rob. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=749.68s)]
*  So I don't know how how you holding up through this crisis? You doing all right? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=757.12s)]
*  Well, I'm just happy that people are talking about how, you know, presidents aren't supposed [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=763.0400000000001s)]
*  to do executive orders and not supposed to have wars and Congress is supposed to allocate the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=767.44s)]
*  budget and no one else is supposed to do that. So Oh, no, no, no, Rob, I'm sorry, you maybe didn't [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=771.9200000000001s)]
*  check the fine print. None of that is a constitutional crisis at all. Oh, turns out that's totally cool. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=776.32s)]
*  The crisis is that Trump might defy a judge's order. That's literally what they're all freaking [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  out about. It is. It's just hilarious. I don't know what to say. It's just like there. It's the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=789.2s)]
*  Democrats and the the corporate media. They they always like rely on taking things to Def Con 10 [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=798.32s)]
*  with Donald Trump. It's like their only mechanism to deal with him. And so they just constantly I [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=809.68s)]
*  don't know if you guys saw it. John Stewart actually had a really funny bit where he was talking about [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=817.36s)]
*  Trump. You know, when if you saw Trump fired like a few of the inspector generals [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  and he's going off and he's watching playing this montage of everyone freaking out about it, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. He's like, Oh, my God, he can't do that. And then they cut to someone at NBC, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=831.92s)]
*  I think was reading the law. And they were like, the President may fire inspector generals, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=837.76s)]
*  but he is required to give written notice and 30 days notice or something like that. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=843.36s)]
*  And John Stewart is like, Oh, so that's the fight. The fight is just over whether he gave the notice [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=847.68s)]
*  he was supposed to give to or not. And you're like, you just can't you can't make this 11. Like, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=852.48s)]
*  it's just not that big of a thing. But this is what they're attempting to do. It does seem [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm curious what Biden did with the student loan debts. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=864.64s)]
*  Oh, I was actually have a clip of that was so funny, man. It's like literally just the exact [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=867.4399999999999s)]
*  thing that Biden just did like two years ago. You got to look me in what is what is Trump ignoring? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=872.16s)]
*  I don't know how I missed this. You know, there's I think there's a couple things that but it was, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=878.16s)]
*  I, you know, I actually have to double check this one. I think the one that they were flipping out [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=883.36s)]
*  about the most was had to do with a judge striking down the birthright citizenship thing, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=887.76s)]
*  which does seem like it's like, yeah, you can't do that through executive order. But at the same [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=894.3199999999999s)]
*  time, it's like, you know, also, like a president defying a court isn't actually unprecedented. And [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=898.48s)]
*  is it that I think the issue really comes down to the fact that like, it's I know, people will claim [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=905.6s)]
*  they love to use the term what about ism when you say stuff like this, God, if there is one word that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=911.84s)]
*  I could strike from the English language, it would be what about ism. It even it even overtakes [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=917.36s)]
*  anti semitism and transphobia for me as words that I would just love to not to not ever hear again. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=924.88s)]
*  But what about is I don't even know where the word came from. I hate it linguistically. I think it's [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=931.92s)]
*  a terrible work. Like it just sounds like a teenager. It sounds like a teenager like pulling [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=938.16s)]
*  gum out of their mouth and twirling their hair with the other finger would be like, yeah, just [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=942.08s)]
*  know what about ism, you know. But it's also just like it's like a way to dismiss. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=946.08s)]
*  Putting anything into context or pointing out hypocrisy, you just have a magical word you [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=953.44s)]
*  could say that. And I'm not saying like there is a scenario where like it would make sense to be [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=958.64s)]
*  like you're distracting from the issue by being like, what about this unrelated thing? You know, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=964.24s)]
*  if I'm like, you know, Rob, like you got blackout drunk last night and came home and beat the shit [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=968.64s)]
*  out of your girlfriend, dude, like this is a real problem. And you went, yeah, well, you smoked weed [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=972.8s)]
*  last month. You did. OK. But we're talking about this right now. You know, for that a red herring. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes. Right. Right. Right. Exactly. But if I this is not a what about ism where I go look, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=982.56s)]
*  over the last 20 years, OK, there have been as you just alluded to, Rob, right. We've we've had [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=989.1999999999999s)]
*  decades long wars that were undeclared by the Congress. If you read the Constitution, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=996.88s)]
*  it is very clear. One of the nice things about the Constitution, by the way, it's not that long of a [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1004.64s)]
*  book. Pretty easy to read. Pretty simple to kind of understand. I mean, you could argue over finer [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1009.52s)]
*  points, but it's more or less pretty easy to understand. It's not like like it's really not [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  actually that complicated. And they're very clear. Only Congress can declare wars. We have fought [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1019.68s)]
*  decades long wars without congressional declarations of war. Now that in Iraq and [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1024.96s)]
*  in Afghanistan, they got like these authorizations of military force, which is like that's not what [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1031.44s)]
*  the Constitution says. It says you have to declare war. And again, even those are like [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1037.8400000000001s)]
*  incredibly sketchy and have been pulled. So like that we gave the Congress gave the Bush authority [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1046.0s)]
*  gave the Bush administration authority to use force against Saddam Hussein's government. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1054.96s)]
*  Right. Saddam Hussein's government fell like a few weeks after we invaded. So that was gone, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1060.32s)]
*  you know, and then we just stayed there for 20 years. You know what I mean? So it's like [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1066.0s)]
*  that's not you didn't really have anyway. Either way, you didn't have a declaration of war. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1069.44s)]
*  The other wars besides Afghanistan and Iraq, the wars in Libya, in Syria, in Somalia, in Yemen, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1074.72s)]
*  the drone bombing campaign in Pakistan, they never got anything. They just never even like [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1083.04s)]
*  went to come right. So we have like you had torture was instituted in the Bush administration, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1087.92s)]
*  clearly a violation of the of the Constitution. You've had I mean, what could be a more clear [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1095.36s)]
*  violation of the Constitution than Barack Obama having US citizens killed, assassinating US [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1101.76s)]
*  citizens? I mean, just just read through the Bill of Rights and you tell me if there's any [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1109.68s)]
*  way you could interpret that to mean that you can murder an American citizen who hasn't been [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1115.2s)]
*  charged with a crime. No, forget a trial. Hey, George Washington didn't realize how cool drones [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1120.3200000000002s)]
*  were. Yeah, I guess that's I guess that might be part of it. But anyway, so but just so the idea [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1126.48s)]
*  that we've lived through all of this, and none of these people ever called any of that a [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1131.52s)]
*  constitutional crisis. None of them ever thought about like lockdowns. Just look at lockdowns. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1136.88s)]
*  You're like, you know, I remember is my one of my favorite moments through all of COVID. It was very [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1143.2s)]
*  early on. It was my governor, Governor Murphy here in New Jersey, Tucker Carlson had him on [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1147.7600000000002s)]
*  and said, actually, Natalie, see if you could find this. Tucker Carlson, Governor Murphy, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1156.0800000000002s)]
*  First Amendment. Let's see if you could find that because it is almost worth playing as people talk [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1163.44s)]
*  about a constitutional crisis. See, go on YouTube for it. Or whatever. Maybe you might have it right [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1168.96s)]
*  there. Well, yeah, let's let's let's play this. After the state of New York, no state in the country [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1177.2s)]
*  has been hit harder by this virus than the state of New Jersey. As of today, New Jersey has more [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1186.16s)]
*  than 71,000 cases of it. More than 3100 people have died so far. Since the 21st of March, all [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1191.12s)]
*  residents in the state have been under a stay at home order. And that's had a big predictable [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1198.6399999999999s)]
*  economic effect. In the past month, 577,000 New Jerseyans have filed for unemployment. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1202.56s)]
*  Phil Murphy is the governor of New Jersey says that for now, the shutdown will continue. He [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1209.6799999999998s)]
*  joins us tonight. Governor, we really appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you very much. I [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1213.6s)]
*  know you've got a lot to deal with. And I want to say at the outset that I and I mean this sincerely, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1217.28s)]
*  I always presume good faith in the decisions that our leaders are making right now, because I know [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1222.8s)]
*  it's complex, especially for you, the most dense state in the country, second highest death toll. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1226.08s)]
*  But there's a couple things that I find confusing. And I'd love to hear them explained. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1231.6s)]
*  The first is the rationale for the lockdown. Now, you said early on, the point was, and most [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1236.0s)]
*  governors said this was to flatten the curve to spread out the infection so our health care system [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1240.56s)]
*  didn't collapse. It didn't collapse. It came close, but it didn't. Now, today in your press [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1244.88s)]
*  conference, you gave a different rationale for the lockdown. And you said that you can't foresee [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1250.24s)]
*  normal gatherings continuing, I think it's a quote, until essentially there are no more cases. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  Why the change? Again, it's good to be on with you. We believe completely that we don't get a [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1261.0400000000002s)]
*  economic recovery unless we've got a complete or near complete health care recovery. So flattening [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1269.92s)]
*  that curve reduces the amount of hospitalizations, reduces the amount of intensive care beds, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1276.5600000000002s)]
*  ventilators, health care workers needed, et cetera. And so you want to get the line to cross between [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1282.48s)]
*  that and your capacity. If we had let this go, we think three plus million New Jerseyans would have [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1288.4s)]
*  been infected. The number, thank God, is going to be a lot less than that, Tucker. But we're still [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1294.96s)]
*  not out of the woods yet. My comments today were directed at things like high school graduations, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1299.84s)]
*  religious gatherings that folks had asked me about for June. And I just, I can't say with confidence. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  I think April, the next couple of weeks, is going to be our toughest period. May, I hope, please God, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1312.56s)]
*  assuming folks stay home, will be a little bit better. I can't predict with certainty into the [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1318.6399999999999s)]
*  summer. So my rationale is the same. I just got to make sure that I'm being straight with people [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1323.4399999999998s)]
*  about the timing and frankly what we don't know yet. But the standard that we're not going to have [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1328.32s)]
*  these large gatherings, including, as you said, religious services or NFL games, which you have [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  in your state, until we're basically at zero new infections, that's not a standard that we apply to [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1340.1599999999999s)]
*  any other infectious diseases, including diseases that kill, you know, as many people as this is [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1345.52s)]
*  projected to kill. So why the different standard in this case? Yeah, I wouldn't say it's a different [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1350.56s)]
*  standard and maybe it's the way I said it today, but here is the reality. You get that economic [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1355.36s)]
*  recovery, that responsible reopening after you've cracked the back of this. I don't think any of us [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1361.04s)]
*  can expect that we can get this to zero, particularly in the absence of a vaccine, and it sounds like [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1367.04s)]
*  that's a year, a year and a half away. But I do think, and I did say this today and we believe [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1371.76s)]
*  this strongly, that we need a much broader testing regime. And that will give us confidence if we can [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1376.1599999999999s)]
*  quickly test folks. Rutgers University, our state university, by the way, started this week with this [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1383.28s)]
*  alignment test. Yes, sorry, this isn't the part I was thinking of, but it's just kind of interesting to me to just [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1388.3999999999999s)]
*  remember how crazy it was. Let's just pause for a second. I mean, it's just all so, like, he's got no [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1392.0s)]
*  rationale that makes sense. And then also just to know that they got it all wrong. That is just not [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1398.24s)]
*  the case that the lockdowns were stopping the spread at all. And you can look at this, like, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1404.96s)]
*  you can look at the areas that did lock down and didn't lock down and you don't see any reduction [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1409.36s)]
*  in the spread of COVID. So it's just all so crazy. And what a wild time this was. And by the way, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1414.08s)]
*  I should also point out, I think the part I was looking for is coming up soon here, but I should [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1419.84s)]
*  also point out that, you know, this was, I believe this was in April that he did this interview. So [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1424.24s)]
*  this is, you know, the lockdowns hit in March. This is the next month, April. This was the only time [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1432.7199999999998s)]
*  that any lockdown governor got a grilling. Like all the other press conferences would just be like, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1437.84s)]
*  you know, like, Andrew Cuomo, you're so hot. Like, he was just insane. It was insane. I remember [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1445.6799999999998s)]
*  listening to, speaking of constitutional crisis, I remember Andrew Cuomo said in one of his first [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1452.9599999999998s)]
*  press conferences after the lockdowns, because remember, he used to give them every day, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1462.56s)]
*  he said in one of his first press conferences after the lockdowns, that they were just suspending [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1466.72s)]
*  speedy trials. Because they were like, there's just no way you know, the system's moving so slow, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1471.1200000000001s)]
*  that there's no way we can just give everybody a trial when they're supposed to. So we're pushing [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1476.8s)]
*  them back because we don't want to just let people go, they might be guilty. It's just be like, yo, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1480.72s)]
*  and he said this in front of a room full of reporters, not a single one of them followed [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1485.52s)]
*  up on that. And just went, are we in a constitutional crisis now? Because the right to a speedy trial is [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  enshrined in the Constitution, you know, and so you kind of have to do that. You don't have the [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1495.6s)]
*  option. Nope. Elizabeth Warren wasn't out on TV screeching about constitutional crisis. None of [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1499.84s)]
*  that. It's just, I guess the broader point here is just the idea that this represents a constitutional [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1505.6s)]
*  crisis, whereas all these other flagrant violations of the Constitution don't. That's not what aboutism [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1512.24s)]
*  to point out. You know what I'm saying? Like, that's not something that should be dismissed. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1518.08s)]
*  It kind of proves that these people are not serious and they don't actually care about the Constitution [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1521.68s)]
*  at all. You get my point, Rob? It makes sense to me. And I don't understand the. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has not, I would think, violated the law yet where he took someone who was born in [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1534.6399999999999s)]
*  America, declined their birthright citizenship and ejected them from the country. So it sounds very [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1540.8799999999999s)]
*  early. If it and I would assume the birthright citizenship, it seems like Donald Trump does have [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1546.16s)]
*  a bit of a claim there. So my guess is it's going to advance past the first court. So until he [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1552.16s)]
*  actually violates the law, like if he just wants to say, hey, I want to end birthright citizenship [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1557.44s)]
*  and a court comes along and says, well, you can't end birthright citizenship. That's not the end of [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1561.8400000000001s)]
*  that process. And he hasn't actually violated the Constitution, which seemed to me. Whereas in all [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1565.3600000000001s)]
*  of your examples, they actually did take away protected rights such as going to a synagogue. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1570.96s)]
*  And so I think that plays into what you're saying of you didn't really care about the Constitution [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1575.92s)]
*  there. Dude, anybody who's read the Constitution knows, knows damn well that 90 plus percent of [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1581.76s)]
*  what the federal government does is not authorized in the Constitution. You read the Constitution [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1590.64s)]
*  and you look at it, the government that we have in no way, shape or form even resembles the [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1596.1599999999999s)]
*  government that they're laying out there, which was supposed to be and was at one point the most [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1602.32s)]
*  experiment in the most limited of governments. That was the whole idea of the thing. Most of [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1608.24s)]
*  just put constant shackles on the government. The government can't do this. The government can't do [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1613.12s)]
*  that. We're going to take the powers of a government and we're going to divide them up into three [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1617.84s)]
*  co-equal branches, which can all check each other. Then you have the 10th amendment, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1621.68s)]
*  which is another check on top of that, which express that it expressly says in the Constitution [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1625.3600000000001s)]
*  that any right that is not expressly granted to the federal government falls to the states and [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1630.8s)]
*  the people. So like it's not it's not like, oh, if we didn't mention it here, you could interpret [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1636.4s)]
*  that we also have this authority. Why we have a federal reserve. Yeah, there's no there is no [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1640.96s)]
*  authorization for a federal reserve or a Department of Education or a Department of Energy or a CIA or [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1644.88s)]
*  any of these things. It's very clear that none of this should exist if we're following the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1651.1200000000001s)]
*  Constitution. So the idea that we have a constitutional crisis because Trump is defying [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1655.36s)]
*  a judge's order is just ridiculous. The Constitution was shredded over 100 years ago. We do not follow [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1659.2s)]
*  the thing anymore. And, you know, we could get into who exactly is the most responsible for shredding [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1665.2s)]
*  it. And we could have a whole long debate over whether it was Lincoln or Woodrow Wilson. But it [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1670.4s)]
*  was one of those two. But the thing is long dead. So it's just it's a ridiculous assertion. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1675.12s)]
*  OK, are we we got to this point? Now, the Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1681.6s)]
*  right enshrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1693.6s)]
*  together to assemble peacefully. By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1699.4399999999998s)]
*  order? How do you have the power to do that? That's above my pay grade, Tucker. So I wasn't [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1706.08s)]
*  I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this. We went to all first of all, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1712.0s)]
*  we looked at the data. So essentially, that's it, right? That he goes, it's above my pay grade. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1716.3999999999999s)]
*  I wasn't thinking about the Bill of Rights when I did this. Are you telling me how's that not a [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1723.9199999999998s)]
*  constitutional crisis? I think it's very clear. Tucker's like, this is so clearly protected [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1727.68s)]
*  under the Constitution and you're defying that. By what right? Like, where do you get the authority [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1733.8400000000001s)]
*  to I mean, if you like if the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and you swear an oath to [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1738.72s)]
*  it, whatever, where do you get the right to violate it? And his response is that's above my pay grade. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1743.76s)]
*  Do you imagine? It's like, no, that's exactly your pay grade. That is exactly what you specialize [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1751.44s)]
*  in doing. It'd be like if I told you that podcasting was above my pay grade. Like what? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1756.4s)]
*  That's the job. And so you could have one of the lockdown governors the only time correctly, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1761.8400000000001s)]
*  if I'm wrong, I really do believe this was the only time that anyone ever think about what a [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1766.16s)]
*  pathetic media core we have, that this was the only time that a lockdown governor was ever asked [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1770.72s)]
*  directly, where do you get the authority to do this? And his answer is, I don't know. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1776.48s)]
*  I'm not thinking about that. I don't know. So sorry. But hearing AOC and Elizabeth Warren [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1781.12s)]
*  shriek about a constitutional crisis is kind of laughable when all of them cheered this shit on. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1790.32s)]
*  By the way, why don't you pull up that AOC clip that I sent you? This was a this was a fun one. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1797.04s)]
*  There were a bunch of clips of Joe Biden saying essentially the same thing you already alluded to [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1802.08s)]
*  Rob, but AOC is capable of speaking. So it just makes for a better video to play on the podcast. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1806.24s)]
*  There has been thought, I believe, given to this Senator Ron Wyden has already issued statements, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1815.6799999999998s)]
*  for example, advising what we should do in a situation like this, which I concur, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1821.52s)]
*  which is that I believe that the Biden administration should ignore this ruling. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1825.6s)]
*  I think that we, you know, the courts have the legitimacy and they rely on the legitimacy of [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1830.4s)]
*  their rulings. And what they are currently doing is engaged in an unprecedented and dramatic erosion [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1838.96s)]
*  of the legitimacy of the courts. They it is the justices themselves through the deeply partisan [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1846.88s)]
*  and unfounded nature of these rulings that are undermining their own enforcement. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1852.88s)]
*  So you're saying the Biden administration should ignore this court. What does that look like? What [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1859.36s)]
*  does that actually mean? You know, I think the interesting thing when it comes to a ruling is [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1863.6799999999998s)]
*  that it relies on enforcement and it is up to the Biden administration to enforce, to choose whether [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1869.36s)]
*  or not to enforce such a ruling. But is that? OK, so that was our that was our last constitutional [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1877.28s)]
*  crisis. But see, that one was about the abortion pill. So that's OK. It's such an odd thing to [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1883.44s)]
*  say in government. So can I just go commit crimes and then it's up to, I guess, whoever to decide [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1889.68s)]
*  whether they want to enforce that I committed those crimes? By the way, the same this I think [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1895.1200000000001s)]
*  I actually did get that wrong. I don't think it's about I think it's about the funding freeze, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1902.3200000000002s)]
*  not about the the the but so that's essentially they're saying. So now if Donald Trump, whether [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1906.0s)]
*  birthright citizenship or the funding freeze or whatever, it's like so you're so if he defies the [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1912.48s)]
*  courts on this one, somehow that's a constitutional crisis. This isn't because it's an issue you like [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1917.44s)]
*  or something like that. I'm talking a little out of pocket here. But firstly, there's something [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1924.08s)]
*  different about executive powers that restrict the monster as opposed to like build the monster. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1929.04s)]
*  By monster, I mean government. But more specifically, there was that law last year [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1934.24s)]
*  that Congress couldn't just outsource like the the regulation of businesses because they had been [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1937.76s)]
*  doing that. That was like a big hearing. And it sounds like some of this USAID stuff. It's not [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1944.08s)]
*  like Congress specifically it seems to me delegated money, for example, to give it to Politico. They [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1949.04s)]
*  didn't specifically give they were giving money over to the agency. I don't know. Is Congress [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1955.12s)]
*  allowed to do that? Is that the proper use of congressional funds that they can just fund an [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1959.68s)]
*  agency and then an agency can go spend it? However, I don't know enough about this, but it would seem [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1964.48s)]
*  to me like that almost sounds like the regulation thing where they're not actually doing the job. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1969.76s)]
*  They're just handing it to someone else to do it. Well, it's look, I mean, all of these things, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1975.84s)]
*  right? Like it's it's the way this thing just grow. And then they always find some rationalization. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1980.0s)]
*  So like, look, of course, if you read the Constitution and you go Congress is supposed [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1989.68s)]
*  to appropriate the money, and then you see that Congress then just appropriates it to or if you [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=1997.44s)]
*  see, for example, that Congress writes the laws, right, they are the legislative branch. This is [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2003.2s)]
*  how the Constitution now then they create an agency that writes as many regulations as they want to [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2008.24s)]
*  that is enforced by law. They call them regulations, not laws. But look, whether or not you want to say, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2014.72s)]
*  I mean, this is the thing that like legal scholars will argue over these interpretations. But like, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2022.5600000000002s)]
*  you could make an argument that like, well, Congress did write the law and the law was to create [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2027.5200000000002s)]
*  the EPA and then the EPA will write all of these regulations. But it's obviously so against the [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2033.92s)]
*  spirit of the thing. Like whatever you know what I mean? Like whatever you know, this is like even [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2041.04s)]
*  when people will say when you know, I've made the point as many people have many times during this [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2046.72s)]
*  Ukraine Russia war that that promises were made that NATO wouldn't expand one inch to the east. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2053.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. And what people who counter that will say is they'll go now that doesn't count because they [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2059.68s)]
*  made those promises to the Soviet Union. And the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore. Now it's Russia, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2064.96s)]
*  you know, or they'll say that, well, they were really talking about the unification of Germany. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2070.0s)]
*  They weren't specifically talking about, you know, like advancing NATO into Eastern Europe, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2074.48s)]
*  which is not exactly true, because there is, if you read through the the notes from the meetings, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2079.68s)]
*  like no, there were a couple points where they specifically said, because we promised this, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2085.6s)]
*  we also couldn't bring Poland in and stuff like that. But even like getting lost in this debate, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2089.36s)]
*  it's like, okay, fine, but it was clearly totally against the spirit of the thing. The whole spirit [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2095.44s)]
*  of the thing, if you look through the meeting, like you can, and you can read the minutes of the [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2099.92s)]
*  meeting, you look at the whole thing was like the US and Germany and NATO and England, and everybody [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2105.04s)]
*  going to the Soviet Union be like, hey, if you pull your forces back and allow the reunification [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2112.16s)]
*  of Germany, we won't take advantage of this moment. That was the whole thing over and over [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2118.4s)]
*  and over again, we won't take advantage of this, we won't be dicks to you, we won't put our military [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2122.96s)]
*  hardware closer and closer to your country. Like this was the whole spirit. I mean, why would you [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2127.52s)]
*  promise to not like if you were saying, NATO is gonna reunify, excuse me, Germany is going to [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2131.6s)]
*  reunify? Well, why would you promise to not move NATO into Eastern Germany, because it's closer [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2137.7599999999998s)]
*  to Russia, right? Because it's coming closer into your sphere. So the whole spirit of the thing was [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2143.92s)]
*  and like, it's kind of like that with the Constitution, even if you can make some abstract [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2148.64s)]
*  argument that like, well, technically, Congress, it's clearly against the spirit of what the thing [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2153.52s)]
*  was suggesting. But what was like, oh, sure, go ahead. To state it a little bit differently, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2158.0s)]
*  what do you call Congress circumventing our laws to go pay for bio weapons in China? What do you [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2164.2400000000002s)]
*  call that if not a constitutional crisis? What do you call having state funded media that then acts [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2171.6s)]
*  as an authority and tells you that a laptop that would have influenced an election isn't real? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2178.48s)]
*  And so when all these people are just screaming about trying to protect the status quo, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2183.04s)]
*  and making sure that they can continue to fund things that obviously should not be funded, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2187.36s)]
*  like the conversation here is not all right, Elon Musk should not be allowed to take away funds [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2192.32s)]
*  that have been appropriated by Congress. And clearly, we need some other mechanism to clean [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2199.04s)]
*  this up. It seems like they're just shouting to go, we need to continue with what was the status quo, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2202.8s)]
*  because it was hiding us moving forward on our agenda, or things that the American people [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2207.6s)]
*  didn't want. So it's very rich to declare that a constitutional crisis, because what is the return [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2211.76s)]
*  to the status quo? If the status quo was money being funded, so that one side could get more [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2217.1200000000003s)]
*  favorable, basically have state funded media and propaganda, or circumvent laws such as a bio weapons, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2222.8s)]
*  I mean, gain of function research, which is essentially bio weapons, the whole thing [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2229.2000000000003s)]
*  partnering with China on that just makes zero sense. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2233.0400000000004s)]
*  Especially by the way, especially with how hawkish so many of the political class are toward China, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2235.6000000000004s)]
*  and how they're always using them as the boogeyman, and we should be afraid of them. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2241.2s)]
*  But behind this is what we're actually doing partnering with them on again, call it a bio [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2244.64s)]
*  weapon, or don't call it a bio weapon. In effect, the thing got out and infected, you know, tens of [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2250.16s)]
*  millions or sorry, billions of people. So yeah, it is still that. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2255.9199999999996s)]
*  Or handouts with just a label of trans study blank trans this trans that that's just a handout to [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2260.48s)]
*  some guy in a way to get more money into, you know, studying gender studies in college and [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2266.88s)]
*  to try and keep the institutional bullshit alive, so that there's some prestige and status [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2273.2000000000003s)]
*  and studying these things and being in that universe. Right. Well, I mean, I remember, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2277.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, so I was I was actually a constitutionalist for like a few years. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2282.0800000000004s)]
*  Like when I first like Ron Paul basically converted me to being a constitutionalist, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2289.2000000000003s)]
*  and then very shortly after that, Murray Rothbard, you know, converted me to full Rothbardian [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2295.12s)]
*  ism. But like, you know, I basically came to the I came to agree with Spooner about the [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2301.44s)]
*  Constitution like the Constitution. What he said it really beautifully. I'll probably butcher this [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2310.96s)]
*  up. But his line was the the Constitution either authorized such a government as we have now, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2315.3599999999997s)]
*  or it was unable to stop it. Either way, it should be disregarded, you know, like, like, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2322.4s)]
*  no matter what, this is where we are. But even for those brief, I mean, there were always parts of [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2328.32s)]
*  the Constitution that I thought were really bad. The interstate commerce clause is terrible. But [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2334.4s)]
*  if you look at the way the thing grows, right, there's this famous there was a famous case that [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2339.84s)]
*  went to the Supreme Court during the New Deal when FDR was president. And it was a guy. So the [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2345.52s)]
*  interstate commerce clause basically says that the federal government has authority to regulate [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2352.08s)]
*  commerce between the states and I think between the states and foreign nations. And I think they [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2357.68s)]
*  also said like Native American tribes or something like that in there. So they have some authority [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2363.92s)]
*  to regulate, you know, the now during the New Deal, they started going crazy with all of these [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2368.4s)]
*  rules about like how much crops you could grow. You know, it's just insane New Deal stuff that [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2373.44s)]
*  prolonged the Great Depression. And it's why the crash happened in 29. And the Great Depression [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2379.68s)]
*  lasted all the way up through World War Two, double digit unemployment rates the entire times [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2384.16s)]
*  FDR's New Deal was an absolute disaster. But so there was this guy who basically got he got [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2389.52s)]
*  prosecuted for growing crops in his own farm. He was not growing more than you're supposed to grow [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2396.96s)]
*  or something like that. And he his defense was like, I'm not taking it across state lines. So [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2403.8399999999997s)]
*  the federal government has no right to regulate right. This is not interstate commerce. This is [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2409.04s)]
*  just me growing something on my property, you have no authority to and the Supreme Court determined [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2413.36s)]
*  that because he was because that could affect the price of crops in general, that it was there for [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2418.7200000000003s)]
*  interstate commerce. Now, I mean, I'm sure this is the way the world works. Smart people can [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2427.12s)]
*  rationalize almost anything. But come on, man, I just look at that. It's totally against the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2434.0s)]
*  spirit of the thing. This is not in any way interstate commerce. This is a man growing [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2439.04s)]
*  something on his own property. But they've interpreted the interstate commerce clause [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2444.32s)]
*  to give them license to regulate what you grow on your own property. So [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2449.44s)]
*  you want to argue that that's constitutional. It totally violates the spirit of the thing. So [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2456.16s)]
*  obviously. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2461.36s)]

*  when leftists will like invoke Christianity to try to own a conservative or something like that. But [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2530.0s)]
*  it's like, dude, you don't care about Christianity at all. So like, what are you doing? This is such [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2536.2400000000002s)]

*  almost the top of the hour here. So maybe I'll get into this, this stuff I wanted to say to the [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2551.3599999999997s)]
*  Libertarian Party. So I was gonna yesterday I was writing out a long I was going to put out a long [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2557.3599999999997s)]
*  tweet that was like a message to the Libertarian Party. And I started going through and it was [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2566.48s)]
*  just getting way too long. And I was like, this just isn't good for Twitter. And also, I'm much [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2570.88s)]
*  better at speaking than writing. So I'm not that great at speaking. That's how bad I am at writing. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2576.4s)]
*  So I figured maybe I would just say this. Because I was thinking about this the other day. And it [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2582.1600000000003s)]
*  was after I had a phone call with Michael Heiss, and I kind of was thinking about some of this stuff. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2587.84s)]
*  And, you know, there was just, you know, obviously, Angela just stepped down as chair. And it kind of [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2593.12s)]
*  seems like the Libertarian Party is in a different place than I think it's ever been. Certainly at a [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2600.96s)]
*  drastically different place than it was when I joined, I joined the party in 2018. And I [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2607.92s)]
*  became very active in the party after the Joe Jorgensen, Spike Cohen run in 2020. And I've been [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2614.8s)]
*  less active in the party more recently. But I was just thinking about kind of [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2624.24s)]
*  some of the issues that when we first came into the Libertarian Party, and you remember well, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2632.96s)]
*  Rob, because you were there, that we were kind of trying to insert when I say we I mean, the [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2636.88s)]
*  Mises Caucus, you know, led by Michael Heiss. And there were all of these issues that we were [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2640.32s)]
*  trying to insert that looking back at it now have aged so well. And I was just kind of now, by the [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2645.28s)]
*  way, I'm not claiming that the Mises Caucus did everything perfect. There were there were problems, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2653.52s)]
*  starting with me. And, you know, me changing my mind about running, I think really pulled the [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2659.36s)]
*  rug out from underneath the from the caucus. And at that point, the parties, you know, recruiting [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2664.64s)]
*  strategy, fundraising strategy, their plans going forward. And it's, you know, that's on me. And [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2671.2799999999997s)]
*  it's kind of on all of us that we really did not have a viable backup plan. And until Angela kind [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2676.8799999999997s)]
*  of figured one out. But there were there were I would certainly say there were people the Mises [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2684.96s)]
*  Caucus supported who we should not have that turned out to not be worth our support. And perhaps we [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2692.48s)]
*  should have known that at the time. But, you know, part of this was that I had this phone call with [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2699.52s)]
*  Michael Heiss. And then part of it was that Nicole Shanahan, I don't know if you saw this, but when [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2706.56s)]
*  she was on the podcast, she said at one point that the whole MAHA MAGA coalition doesn't happen [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2710.88s)]
*  without the Libertarian Party and that the Libertarian Party was actually the vehicle that [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2717.44s)]
*  brought Bobby Kennedy and Nicole Shanahan and Trump's people together and turned into what is, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2721.44s)]
*  you know, debatably the most powerful political coalition in the world right now. And I just was [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2726.88s)]
*  thinking back on this, like, Rob, do you remember that really the Mises Caucus guys, at least in in [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2733.84s)]
*  the Libertarian Party, were almost the sole faction who was arguing that woke ism is cancer and we [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2738.4s)]
*  need to get this the hell out of Libertarian's minds. And just like, how well did that age? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2745.84s)]
*  Like, it's just that it also we're also finding out now, even to a larger degree, although we've [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2751.36s)]
*  been saying this for years, that the whole thing was totally artificial. It was totally a government [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2756.1600000000003s)]
*  construct. Like this wasn't woke ism was never something that just arose organically from the [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2762.2400000000002s)]
*  bottom up. It was always a top down government program in effect. And like, it's just anyways, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2768.56s)]
*  I mean, remember, like, look, there were when Joe Jorgensen ran for president, there were staffers [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2775.68s)]
*  who were tweeting things like, it's not enough to be passively not racist, we must be actively [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2781.68s)]
*  anti racist, or posting things about the trans genocide. Do you remember this? What they just [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2788.24s)]
*  post about the trans genocide because like, 13 trans people had been killed this year. So they [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2793.7599999999998s)]
*  called it a trans genocide. It's just like these insane things. And then I do think that like, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2799.52s)]
*  man, the Mises caucus really was the faction arguing against that. And just in hindsight, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2804.0s)]
*  we were totally right. Totally vindicated. Is that fair? Yes. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2809.76s)]
*  That's what I like to hear. The other thing was I thought was an interesting one was immigration. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2816.2400000000002s)]
*  I think the Mises caucus and this was not the entirety of the Mises caucus, there was division [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2824.48s)]
*  within the caucus. But I think it was guys in the Mises caucus who are really like, hey, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2830.56s)]
*  I think we need to rethink immigration here. And I think that this idea of supporting open borders [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2834.96s)]
*  is not the correct libertarian position. And it's also just politically unviable. Like you can't. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2840.4s)]
*  And now we're at a point where like, super majorities of the American people support [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2845.36s)]
*  mass deportations. Now, I'm just saying whether or not you're convinced by the libertarian argument [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2850.32s)]
*  on it, you got to kind of admit that it is it's a DOA position for a political party in 2025 to be [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2855.92s)]
*  running on open the border. Zero restrictions on who comes in. I mean, like, even like, Chase, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2864.56s)]
*  who ended up being the nominee, he wasn't running on any of the woke stuff. He wasn't running on [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2874.08s)]
*  open borders, because even he knows it's a goddamn disaster. He was running on trans horseshit. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2877.84s)]
*  A little bit. But even I think he backed off like that. Then he would he was on the record for shit [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2882.56s)]
*  he had said before. And so he'd get asked about that, like by Liz Wolfe. And he didn't but he [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2887.6800000000003s)]
*  didn't really want to talk about it. It's not like he was bringing that up. Like, here's what I'm [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2892.48s)]
*  running on. You know what I mean? It's just when people would grill him about it, he would have to [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2896.16s)]
*  admit like, Yeah, I am kind of awoke hard at heart. So he said it's part of liberty that a person [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2900.56s)]
*  should be able to make their own blah, blah, blah. And he didn't own up to Hey, I'm an idiot [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2906.2400000000002s)]
*  with bad opinions and no one should have fronted me. Yeah, okay, fair enough. But anyway, that I [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2910.08s)]
*  think H and then the other thing that I was really thinking about was just that there's this thing [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2915.04s)]
*  that we really went all in on. And it's hard for people to remember that like, you know, back in [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2918.96s)]
*  2019 2020, the fierce Mises Caucus opposition was like, you guys are right wing culture warriors [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2924.88s)]
*  because we wanted to abandon the woke shit. They said you guys aren't real libertarians because [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2932.48s)]
*  we didn't support open borders. And they also said, I remember this. We always laid out the [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2936.8s)]
*  strategy that the strategy for libertarian candidates should be to utilize the new media [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2942.4s)]
*  podcasts that we should be like, listen, they're gonna black us out of the corporate media, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2948.8s)]
*  but we can totally dominate this new alternative media that's grown bigger than the corporate [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2953.2000000000003s)]
*  media. And we were mocked for this. And people said, Oh, yeah, podcast bros. That's the key to [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2958.0800000000004s)]
*  electoral success. Sure. Twitter is not real life and all these shit like that. And then you [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2965.2s)]
*  literally just watched as the Vivek Ramaswamy, Bobby Kennedy, and of course, Donald Trump, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2970.3199999999997s)]
*  these guys became superstars off of that scene. Okay, Donald Trump was a superstar before, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2977.4399999999996s)]
*  but he won the election off of that scene. I just think like for the Libertarian Party going forward, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2983.68s)]
*  like, at least take those lessons that I think we were like, just objectively right about. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2990.2400000000002s)]
*  I think there's a lot to be said for that. Firstly, there was the cartoonishness of you [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=2997.36s)]
*  coming in with the largest coalition and being called divisive. Yeah, right. And the unity of [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3001.44s)]
*  the party and whatever that nonsense was. And then one of the things that was or the two most [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3007.52s)]
*  annoying things about that, well, there's the autism and lack of women. But once you move past [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3012.1600000000003s)]
*  that, the most annoying things about the Libertarian Party, especially with Joe [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3016.8s)]
*  Jorgensen, is that they absolutely flaked on the COVID thing, which was, you know, I mean, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3021.36s)]
*  talk about a libertarian issue. Oh, yeah. And then there was this kind of underlining of the old [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3025.92s)]
*  guard that felt like they that we needed to appeal to the liberal stupidity and the anti-racist, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3030.88s)]
*  whatever that I don't know even know what that means. But whatever that thing is, it felt like [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3038.1600000000003s)]
*  the Libertarian Party thought that that was the direction it needed to go in. And as the ESG [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3042.88s)]
*  scores and all of this forced socialism starts washing out and what's actually popular can [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3047.92s)]
*  rise up and no longer needs to be shamed away. I think it just showcases the stupidity of those [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3053.52s)]
*  libertarians that thought that that was as opposed to just being more macho and what Donald Trump is [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3059.44s)]
*  and just preaching. We've got the message that everyone wants. And that's that freedom is awesome. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3064.6400000000003s)]
*  And we never should have shied away from it and trying to pretend like we're left makes no sense. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3069.04s)]
*  That shit was always gay. Listen, there's no better way to say it. And I think you're 100 [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3075.44s)]
*  right that Trump winning and all these other conversations happening now kind of showcases [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3080.32s)]
*  just how wrong that old guard of the libertarians were. Look, it's very hard for me to just say this [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3084.32s)]
*  in a more delicate way. But the old guard of the Libertarian Party and this was something and I [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3091.28s)]
*  think this is part of what rubbed a lot of those guys the wrong way about the Mises caucus was that [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3097.04s)]
*  the party was permeated by feminine men. And this is kind of an unfortunate thing. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3104.88s)]
*  You know, Rogan had a great rant on this the other day. But there is look, obviously there [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3115.04s)]
*  are more masculine women and there are more feminine men. OK, they are not nearly as appealing [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3122.56s)]
*  to people. And that's just like it's an unfortunate thing. Like, I don't know what to if you imagine, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3131.2s)]
*  like, imagine if you're a woman, if you're one of the three women listening to this show, OK, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3139.84s)]
*  and imagine and you're into let's say you're a straight woman. So we're down to one. All right, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3146.0s)]
*  if you if you imagine like you saw you were out and you saw a guy who you thought was just like [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3151.92s)]
*  incredibly good looking, like an incredibly good looking guy, like everything you're looking for in [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3158.08s)]
*  a guy, you see this guy and you're just like immediately very attracted to him. And then like [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3162.7200000000003s)]
*  you go over to talk to him or he comes over to talk to you and he's like, what's up, girlfriend? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3167.44s)]
*  You're immediately going to lose all attraction. Like it's just going to like that's just not OK. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3172.2400000000002s)]
*  There might be exceptions to that rule, but generally speaking, that him being like super [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3177.76s)]
*  feminine is going to turn you off immediately. Likewise, if there's a guy you see some super hot [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3182.4s)]
*  chick and you go over to approach her and she's like, bro, and punches you in the shoulder and [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3187.76s)]
*  like belches in front of you, that's going to be like now you're still a man, so you won't lose all [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3192.2400000000002s)]
*  attraction to her. But that's going to be like the biggest turn off you could have. There's [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3196.4s)]
*  there's just something where like men and what Rogan was saying the other day was he was talking [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3200.7200000000003s)]
*  about David Hogg and he was like, good luck getting dudes, good luck getting dudes back on board. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3204.96s)]
*  Guys in general are not going to follow the lead of a super feminine man. That's just not going to [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3210.7200000000003s)]
*  work out like if you're the guy who's like a guy barely brushes by your shoulder and you're like, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3218.64s)]
*  oh, I was assaulted. You're not the leader. You're not a leader of men. And I'm sorry, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3222.96s)]
*  that's just you know, it might be a harsh truth, but it's like it's a truth. And so you can't. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3228.56s)]
*  And there was something and I think it goes hand in hand with that. But one of the most important [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3233.2s)]
*  things that the Mises caucus was always pushing. Now, remember getting in arguments with people [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3238.16s)]
*  about this and it speaks to what you were talking about with the COVID stuff is that look, if we're [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3242.3999999999996s)]
*  going to be a third party, and we're going to stand for this libertarian philosophy, then we have to, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3247.12s)]
*  we have to take on the controversial issues while they're happening. We have to grab the third rail [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3254.3199999999997s)]
*  with both hands. That's the only way to make noise. And you know, that you have and this is [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3262.08s)]
*  one of the things I'm not saying the Mises caucus messaging was always perfect. There was there was [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3268.08s)]
*  always I always had critiques of messaging. I have critiques of almost every libertarian messenger, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3272.0s)]
*  almost everyone. There's like five that I think get it completely right. But one thing you could [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3278.48s)]
*  say about the Libertarian Party after the Mises caucus took over it took over the thing, the war [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3283.92s)]
*  in Ukraine broke out, we were against it immediately, loudly when it costs something. Yeah, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3288.96s)]
*  we got smeared as Russians assets or whatever, who cares? They're gonna they're gonna smear you if [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3294.6400000000003s)]
*  you're ever being successful, no matter what. The war in Gaza broke out against it immediately when [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3299.92s)]
*  there's a really white hot you know, these these things like you you you could just watch it happen, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3305.04s)]
*  we know still to this day, right? Me and you benefit so much from having been right about COVID [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3312.0s)]
*  when it happened. Like that people gain trust in you. And this would be this huge thing that the [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3317.84s)]
*  the Libra, it's so insane that the Libertarian Party doesn't get to own that, that they don't [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3324.48s)]
*  get to say, hey, there is a party that was opposed to lockdowns when it happened. They can't really [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3329.52s)]
*  say that because they weren't. And like that, there is something about that that's connected [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3334.88s)]
*  to the masculine energy thing. There is something about that. That's like, no, that's what it is to [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3340.48s)]
*  be a man is like, no, I'm gonna say how what I fucking believe. And if Oh, if that means I [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3345.04s)]
*  got to take some arrows, good. Fuck you. I don't care. You know what I mean? Like there's just the [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3350.0s)]
*  party needs that. Anyway, I do just think I just kind of wanted to share that I do think that there [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3354.88s)]
*  were, you know, and then of course, the other big one, the last one I'll mention before we go is [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3359.92s)]
*  being well being willing to leverage the Libertarian Party, you know, that nobody else [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3366.96s)]
*  except people in the Mises caucus were possibly ever going to consider that doing what Angela did. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3372.96s)]
*  And you can sit here and have your gripes about it. And you could complain. Look, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3378.08s)]
*  she saved Ross's life, saved saved a guy's life who was wrongly imprisoned. It's more than the [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3384.88s)]
*  party's accomplished in its entire history. And that is a very real accomplishment. And then on [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3390.4s)]
*  top of that, where you see so much of the stuff that we're getting out of Doge, and just the way [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3394.88s)]
*  the public conversation has changed. I mean, the Libertarian Party was a an important part of this. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3399.2s)]
*  And I think the Libertarian vote was an important part of that. Look, dude, you could just look [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3405.8399999999997s)]
*  at the the numbers right of so there's like, you know, the Libertarian Party was finishing in third [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3409.9199999999996s)]
*  place in the presidential election every year. I think Gary Johnson got like four and a half million [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3417.52s)]
*  votes. I think Joe Jorgensen got like one and a half million votes. Chase finished like fifth. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3422.48s)]
*  He lost to Jill Stein, he lost to Bobby Kennedy, he lost to the guy who told people not to vote for [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3429.7599999999998s)]
*  him. Okay, so like, where did all those Libertarian votes go? Seems like they went to Trump. You know, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3433.2799999999997s)]
*  like it seems like that's kind of what happened here is that these votes went to Donald Trump. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3440.48s)]
*  And the with the political makeup of the United States of America, if you're talking about like [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3445.12s)]
*  3 million votes, that's a huge deal, you know, and that's so look, I think these are all things that [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3449.4399999999996s)]
*  the Libertarian Party in the next iteration of it, whatever that's going to look like, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3456.1600000000003s)]
*  and to whatever extent I'm involved in that this is the type of thing that I would be encouraging [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3461.6800000000003s)]
*  them is like, look, man, say what you will about the caucus, we were dead right on these most [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3466.1600000000003s)]
*  crucial issues, which really were the things that we led with that were like, look, this is what the [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3472.48s)]
*  party should be about. And I think it's really hard looking back at it to not at least admit that, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3477.44s)]
*  like if you're being fair, anybody who's following has been following the LP circles for all these [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3483.44s)]
*  years, you know that all the things I just listed, there were major debates about this, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3488.4s)]
*  and people were arguing against us on it. And they're, you know, where are they now? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3492.4s)]
*  Anybody really arguing? Hey, if we want to really have some success, we got to be social justice [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3499.52s)]
*  warriors, social justice warriors for open borders. What a great political strategy that is. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3504.16s)]
*  So anyway, just something I was thinking about. And I wanted to do that little rant. All right. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3510.24s)]
*  We can wrap up on that. I got to head over to Princeton University. Looking forward to it. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3516.24s)]
*  Hope to see some of you guys out there. Catch you next time. Peace. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80IaTcFtWs&t=3521.4399999999996s)]
