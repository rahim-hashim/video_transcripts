**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY)
*  What's up? What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. I am rolling solo for this episode. But thank you all for joining us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=11.92s)]
*  Rob will be back tomorrow for the members only. And I know we still owe you a couple [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  members only. We will make those up to you later this week. Just got to figure out some [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=23.36s)]
*  times to do that. I do also, sorry we're starting just a few minutes late here, but I was just [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=28.46s)]
*  recording Pierce Morgan. So that show ended up starting a little bit late and then I was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=32.94s)]
*  on that. So we ended up starting a little bit late here. That should be out later today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=38.94s)]
*  Usually they put them out later the same day that we record them. So probably look for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=44.02s)]
*  that later today. That's always a fun show to do. And well, okay, it's usually a fun [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=47.14s)]
*  show to do. And this was a good one. So yeah, I think it was a good one. You never know [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=54.14s)]
*  until you watch these things back. Anyway, there's a few things I wanted to talk about [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=58.84s)]
*  on today's show. And then I will try to take some questions from the chat. So if you guys [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=63.580000000000005s)]

*  are hate watching, but that's okay. The rest of you love it dearly. All right. So last [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=105.94s)]
*  night I did an Oxford style debate at Princeton. It was a lot of fun. It was a very interesting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=111.78s)]
*  experience. I figured I like to kind of talk about these debates sometimes after the fact, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=124.78s)]
*  I thought it went very well. I won pretty dominantly on the Oxford voting. And I mean, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=130.94s)]
*  look, I'm not, I'm not trying to be a dick or anything like this to Josh, but it was also [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=140.3s)]
*  just, I think it was a pretty one sided debate. I mean, he's a nice enough guy and I do appreciate [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=145.66s)]
*  that he was like respectful and he was very cool after the debate and stuff like that. But there, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=152.78s)]
*  I don't know. I just thought that there were a few things about it that I kind of found [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=159.22s)]
*  interesting. And it's just a little bit, it's a little bit surreal as a lot of things that I do [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=163.82s)]
*  in my career are. It's all kind of strange to me still, but you know, like going, I'm literally [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=171.7s)]
*  a college dropout going to an Ivy league school to debate the senior editor of Newsweek about [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=180.14s)]
*  one of the most important issues in the world. And it's, I don't know. I mean, maybe this is just, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=187.06s)]
*  it felt to me like just being there, but then also winning by such a landslide. It was such [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=192.58s)]
*  an indictment of college in general. Like what are you people doing here? You're all wasting [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=203.3s)]
*  your time. I don't mean to attack all of the people who just hosted me and were very nice to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=209.86s)]
*  me the other day, but it really is something where you're just like, I mean, I know college makes [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=216.5s)]
*  sense for some people and certainly there are some professions, you know, if you're going to be a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=220.1s)]
*  surgeon, you're going to need to go to college for quite a long time. And it's a very important [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=225.38s)]
*  thing to have surgeons. So I'm not suggesting we don't have that, but it just kind of like, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  you're like anything in this area of just like, you know, anything about like educating yourself [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=234.26s)]
*  on a topic. It's just totally, it's very strange because I'm going to Princeton. I've never been [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  to Princeton University before and you know, it's a beautiful campus and they have these very old [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=246.02s)]
*  buildings, like the building we were in. I mean, I don't know when it was built, but it was pre [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=252.26000000000002s)]
*  pre-war is understating it. It was an old, old building and a beautiful building. But it's just [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=259.22s)]
*  like, I'm in this really old building and you're sitting there going like, yeah, isn't this whole [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  thing just so outdated? Like when, when colleges, when, when universities were first being built, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=270.42s)]
*  I'm curious and Natalie, could you look up what year was Princeton University built? So I'm just [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=278.74s)]
*  kind of curious about that. But around the time when this university is being built, right, you'd [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  have to think that a huge part of the attraction would be that like, oh, well we have, so 1746. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=292.5s)]
*  Wow, that's actually much older than I thought. That's why these buildings are so old. It's all [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=304.98s)]
*  making sense now. So, so Princeton was built before the United States of America. I did not know that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=308.9s)]
*  Okay, so we were colonies when Princeton was built. Okay, so, but, but just, I mean, you know, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=317.46s)]
*  look, I'm not like an expert in this or anything, but obviously it just found out. I didn't even [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=324.97999999999996s)]
*  know when the university was created. But you would think that a big part of like why you would have [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=328.41999999999996s)]
*  a university would be like, okay, well look, we have all the great books here, right? Like we have, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=336.5s)]
*  we have like a library with all of these great books, like good luck finding this collection [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=343.14s)]
*  somewhere else. And then you'd be like, okay, and we have these professors who have read all the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=347.86s)]
*  books and written a bunch of books and these people who really understand these issues and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=352.9s)]
*  they can help teach you. So now you have like all the great, you know, all the great literary works [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=356.9s)]
*  and then you have really smart people who can teach them to you and stuff like that. And so like [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=362.98s)]
*  at the time that made sense, but like if at the time, like in 1746, if you had been like, oh, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=366.9s)]
*  well everybody has access to all of these books. You can just, you can push a little button on a [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=374.5s)]
*  machine that fits in your pocket and it'll be right in your door in 24 hours. Or, you know, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=379.06s)]
*  you can just use that machine in your pocket to go read the book or whatever. And in terms of like [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=383.53999999999996s)]
*  great professors, it goes like, oh yeah, there's every single great lecture that you could ever [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=390.17999999999995s)]
*  have thought of is right here on your phone. And like, if that existed, it just seems like you'd [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=394.5s)]
*  be like, oh, well then we don't need to build Princeton, you know, like, or at least you would [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=398.74s)]
*  have needed a much smaller version of it or something like that. And so anyway, it's just a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=403.78s)]
*  weird, there's something about something about winning a debate at an Ivy league school when [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=407.62s)]
*  you're a college dropout is just, I don't know. I mean, you guys could draw your own conclusions [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=413.3s)]
*  from that, but it did just, I don't know, it just felt bizarre and kind of almost like the very act [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=418.1s)]
*  of that could break so many people of the spell that you should even be spending this money. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=426.26000000000005s)]
*  And then on top of that, you know, the money that it costs to go to Princeton is insane. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=432.02000000000004s)]
*  It's just unbelievable how expensive it is. And so it's like you're charging people for this thing. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=437.38s)]
*  And then I got students here and a whole bunch of them, like after the debate telling me they [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=442.18s)]
*  learned so much from the debate and you're like, it's, I don't know, just kind of bizarre to me. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=447.06s)]
*  Anyway, the debates are always interesting. I like doing them for several reasons. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=452.66s)]
*  But I think that I always feel like I have an obligation to do debates. At least like, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=461.86s)]
*  I don't know exactly what the number is that I'm supposed to do every year, but I think I have to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=470.02s)]
*  at least do like five or six of these a year. But I think I'd probably do more than that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=474.98s)]
*  But I guess because it just seems to me like if I in my strange career, you know, I go on like some [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=483.06s)]
*  of the biggest shows in the world. So if I'm on Joe Rogan's show or I'm on Tucker Carlson's show or [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=494.66s)]
*  Patrick Bette David or Candace Owens or whoever like the really big shows are. These are shows that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=500.9s)]
*  are much, much, much bigger than anything on television in these spaces. And so I go on all [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=506.82s)]
*  these shows and I'm always like, well, look, it's like this. And then I lay out my case, you know, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=514.9s)]
*  and it's like, oh, okay. But if I'm going to go on those big shows and say, hey, look, this is the way [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=519.4599999999999s)]
*  it is, then I feel like there's a little bit of an obligation on me to present these ideas against [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=524.58s)]
*  somebody who's going like, no, it's not like that at all. And see where the ideas, you know, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=531.22s)]
*  whose ideas come out on top. So I've always kind of felt like a little bit of an obligation to do [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=535.22s)]
*  this. And I get, you know, at the end of these things, I tend to get like a lot of, you know, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=539.62s)]
*  a lot of nice stuff is said about me. And, you know, then, you know, people on social media and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=550.4200000000001s)]
*  in the comment section and stuff like that, which by the way, is one of the only, I am not big on [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=555.62s)]
*  reading comment sections, except for debates. The debates, I always go through the comment section [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=560.5s)]
*  because I just, you know, I kind of, I'm interested, the whole point of a debate is really to persuade [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=566.26s)]
*  the audience. I mean, you hope with the person you're debating that obviously you're never going [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=573.38s)]
*  to like completely change someone's mind. Like a debate, like it's not like if a libertarian and a [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=579.62s)]
*  leftist debate never once in the history of the world has one side been like, you know what, I am [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=586.5s)]
*  no longer a leftist because you just made such compelling arguments that I'd like, that's not [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=591.86s)]
*  going to happen. But I think if you have an honest debate opponent, you'd hope that you could at least [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=596.5s)]
*  get a little nugget in there that might stick with them. And then they're like, okay, I do have to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=602.98s)]
*  think about that a little bit more. But really the point is to persuade the audience. And so I am [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=607.14s)]
*  always kind of interested to be like, okay, when I'm battling somebody who's taking like a diametrically [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=611.9399999999999s)]
*  opposed view to me, what did the audience think? Like, did the audience think that I made a more [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=617.38s)]
*  compelling argument than this guy did? Or if they didn't, what was the thing that they didn't think? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=621.4599999999999s)]
*  And then that kind of helps me to think of like, oh, well, maybe there's a better way I could put [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=625.6999999999999s)]
*  this or maybe I have to rethink that. But, you know, aside from complaints about the audio [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=629.38s)]
*  issues, which unfortunately there were some issues with the mic feeds, like cutting in and out, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=634.98s)]
*  I did, one of them, they told me, you know, we did have backup mics on as well. So I think [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=640.74s)]
*  I, one of the people from the event told me like, we can try to fix some of that in post. So hopefully [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=647.06s)]
*  that that's a little bit better if you haven't watched the debate yet, by the time you go to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=652.42s)]
*  watch it. But I mean, the comments were just, you know, it was, it was very one sided that, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=657.14s)]
*  you know, again, I'm not like trying to, you know, spike the football or anything like that, but [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=662.02s)]
*  I want to talk about this and there's kind of no way to avoid talking about that aspect of it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=667.6999999999999s)]
*  I've done now, I think I've got since October 7th, I think I've done like nine or 10 Israel debates. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=672.58s)]
*  And again, maybe I'm not the one who should be saying this, but it's, I've won all of them. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=683.14s)]
*  And it's kind of just been a question of like, how much of a blowout it was, like how dominant [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=690.02s)]
*  the victory was. And I do, you know, I get like a lot of people saying to me, like, you know, like [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=697.14s)]
*  David, David's just unbeatable in these debates. And like, I did such a good job or something like [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=706.34s)]
*  that. And I just really do think it's an it's important for people to understand that that's [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=711.7s)]
*  not really the story. It's not that I'm so good at debating or I'm so smart or anything like that. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=716.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't think I don't, you know, like Josh Hammer was a very competent opponent. And he's [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=723.94s)]
*  clearly a smart guy. And he's clearly read a lot of stuff. I've just read better stuff. And that's [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=731.94s)]
*  really what this comes down to. This just like that I've I've just read like I've read the people [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=738.9s)]
*  he's read. And I'm also reading a lot of people who just have a way better argument than he does. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=744.74s)]
*  And that's that's kind of really it. Like really, that is the takeaway is that the the libertarians [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=749.06s)]
*  are just right about this issue. And if you act, you know, like in in like debate club or whatever, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=756.42s)]
*  I mean, I didn't do that. But it's actually by the way, actually, I shouldn't say that I did [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=762.98s)]
*  join a debate club in in high school. And I think I did one debate. And then it just it [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=768.26s)]
*  conflicted with basketball practice. And I was like, Oh, yeah, there's no that's an easy choice. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=775.54s)]
*  And I just dropped it. But they would, you know, like it's a thing they do for like high schoolers [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=780.34s)]
*  and debate clubs. They'll they'll make you switch sides and argue the other side, you know, like you [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=786.42s)]
*  have to argue the pro and then you have to argue the con of any issue. So that's like really just [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=791.62s)]
*  testing your debating ability. And I don't think I could have done any better of a job if I had to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=795.94s)]
*  take Josh's side of the argument. You know what I'm saying? It's not like, Oh, my debating ability [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=801.46s)]
*  is so great. It's just my side's right. You know, and and I think it was like overwhelming the the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=805.62s)]
*  overwhelmingly obvious. I mean, essentially, my I stuck we it was a very short time format, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=813.3800000000001s)]
*  like I did the Soho Forum Oxford style debate, which I believe I'm going to be I'm supposed to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=821.78s)]
*  give Gene Epstein a call later. I think I'm going to set up another one through Soho Forum, which [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=827.38s)]
*  because I just love those guys so much. Soho forum.org free plug for for Gene and the guys. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=831.6999999999999s)]
*  But I think his his thing was like you get a 15 minute opening statement. And then you get a five [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=838.26s)]
*  minute. So it's like 15 minute opening statement, 15 minute opening statement, then a five minute [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=844.18s)]
*  rebuttal, then a five minute rebuttal. And then at the end, you get like a 10 minute closing [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=848.5s)]
*  statement. This was a five minute opening statement and a five minute closing statement with no [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=852.58s)]
*  rebuttals. So it was you had to be really, you know, like condensed in what your opening thoughts [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=857.3s)]
*  were. And then the whole debate was just questions and interacting with each other, which I do like, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=862.98s)]
*  you know, I but I it makes it a little bit challenging to like kind of lay out your view [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=868.98s)]
*  in five minutes. And so I really just stuck to like two major points. Then I was like, well, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=875.06s)]
*  look, here's the here's the costs of the US relationship with Israel. And number one is [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=880.3399999999999s)]
*  the war on terrorism, which Israel used its its not insignificant influence, let's just say, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=886.18s)]
*  to lobby America into. And the you know, the cost of this is in like eight trillion dollars and four [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=896.02s)]
*  million dead innocent people and, you know, tens of thousands of dead American soldiers. If you [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=904.02s)]
*  count the if you count the ones who committed suicide in the wake of the wars, it's like 36,000 [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=909.06s)]
*  or something like that. And I was kind of like, hey, right away, that's the cost of the relationship. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=914.34s)]
*  What benefit is larger than that? And then my my secondary point was just that we inherit all this [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=920.5s)]
*  hatred around the world because we back Israel and you know, like and it was just like, there was [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=927.54s)]
*  just no argument like Josh, he tried to kind of, you know, like nitpick around the edges of this. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=933.06s)]
*  But I just, you know, I know my stuff. So he just wasn't like he tried to argue that like, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=940.3399999999999s)]
*  actually, the Sharon's guys didn't support the war in Iraq. But then I just know my stuff. I've just [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=945.8599999999999s)]
*  I've read all this stuff. So I just know the truth. And the truth is just not that it's not true. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=952.18s)]
*  It's like the truth is that, okay, there was one of Sharon's actually, I think it was two Sharon's [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=956.18s)]
*  guys who Ariel Sharon was the prime minister at the time when we invaded Iraq, not Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=962.18s)]
*  He had Benjamin Netanyahu was in from like 96 to 2000. Then Sharon came in and then and then [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=969.54s)]
*  Netanyahu came back in later. But so the you know, he was like, oh, the Sharon's guys didn't want to [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=975.14s)]
*  fight the war in Iraq. But that's not actually true. What happened is that Sharon's guys wanted [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=981.54s)]
*  America to topple Saddam Hussein. They were all for it. But they wanted America to overthrow the [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=985.94s)]
*  government in Iran first. So they came to George W. Bush when they heard he had plans of invading Iraq. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=992.6600000000001s)]
*  And they were like, no, no, no, dude, do Iran first, then come back and get Saddam Hussein. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=998.0200000000001s)]
*  So he tried to position that as like they were against the war in Iraq. But that's not exactly [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1003.3800000000001s)]
*  right. And then once they got assurances from the neoconservatives and the Bush administration [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1008.4200000000001s)]
*  and Netanyahu that don't worry, we're going to do the war in Iran after like we're going to [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1014.5s)]
*  overthrow Saddam Hussein and then we'll go overthrow the mullahs in Iran. Then they got [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1020.02s)]
*  completely on board with it. And they in fact started manufacturing a bunch of the most outrageous [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1023.7s)]
*  propaganda about how Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction under the Sharon government. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1028.98s)]
*  So again, he's he was like trying to but there's just not really an argument there. And perhaps if [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1033.3s)]
*  somebody hadn't, you know, like if I hadn't read John Mearsheimer or something like that, maybe I [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1038.98s)]
*  wouldn't know all of that. But I've done my homework and I'm just on the right side of the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1043.14s)]
*  debate. And so it's just I don't know. It's like if you if we were doing a debate that was like [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1047.8600000000001s)]
*  and the resolution was like slavery is immoral. And I was on the affirmative and someone else [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1057.22s)]
*  took the negative and I just won the debate. I don't think you'd be like, oh my god, David, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1063.94s)]
*  you're such an amazing debater. You just be like, no, he's clearly just right about this. Like this [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1067.46s)]
*  isn't it's not a comment really on who's better at this or worse at this. It's just a comment on [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1071.46s)]
*  there's just the argument is so irrefutable. At least that's my perspective on it. Obviously, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1077.7s)]
*  everybody's allowed to have their own perspective. You can go watch the debate and tell me what you [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1084.02s)]
*  thought. I'm curious to hear. I'll check in the in the chat if anybody had any comments on that. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1087.94s)]
*  Dave is spitting facts right now and you guys are goofing in the chat. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1096.26s)]
*  Well, there you go. Thank you. I appreciate that. But anyway, it was it was interesting. You know, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1101.86s)]
*  I I think that, you know, and like like I said, I've I've been very critical of say people like Ben [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1107.54s)]
*  Shapiro, who I think, you know, he's he's made supporting Israel the center of his entire identity [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1114.18s)]
*  and his entire political worldview. And he's never debated a competent critic of Israel. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1125.7s)]
*  I just find that to be like outrageous. Like, I'm not saying obviously there's like the expectation [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1133.14s)]
*  isn't that you're going to debate everyone. Believe me, I get that all the time. But you know, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1138.82s)]
*  somebody with like 200 Twitter followers who I've never heard of who's like, you're afraid to debate [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1143.3s)]
*  me on this. You're like, yeah, okay, well, you know, time is a scarce resource, and I can't devote it [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1147.38s)]
*  to everybody. So I got to, you know, choose a more high profile debate at this point in my career. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1153.14s)]
*  But I think it's very reasonable for me to say there's a responsibility on you to debate someone. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1159.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, the list of like capable critics of Israel is is, you know, maybe we could use [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1165.46s)]
*  some more people. But there's a lot and like pick one of them. None of us would, you know, like it's [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1173.5400000000002s)]
*  not like if if if Ben Shapiro announced that he was debating Norman Finkelstein, it's not like you [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1179.62s)]
*  would hear me or Scott Horton being like, No, you have to debate me. We'd be like, great. Okay, yes, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1186.1799999999998s)]
*  go do that. It's, I just think it's like, I do think there's something cowardly about, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1191.3799999999999s)]
*  like, only debating 17 year olds or 19 year olds at college universities, like, even if you're going [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1198.8999999999999s)]
*  to do that, if you're going to kind of make your name of going to a college campus and slapping [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1206.18s)]
*  down the kids in the audience, which I just don't really like, I don't like any of that. I don't [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1210.98s)]
*  my beef with it. And like, look, I know Charlie Kirk does a lot of that stuff. And I like Charlie, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1216.98s)]
*  I've been on his show a few times. And he's always been cool to me. I appreciate that. I don't even [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1221.78s)]
*  mind. At least my my view on it is like, if I were going to do that, like, let's say I was going into [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1227.54s)]
*  a college campus, and I was trying to, you know, I had a group of college kids who disagreed with [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1234.98s)]
*  me on something. And we were like, arguing about it. I just feel like my attitude would always be [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1243.22s)]
*  much more like, let me let me throw my arm around you and be like, Hey, did you ever consider this? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1249.38s)]
*  You know, did you ever think about it like this? Look, I when I was your age, I felt this way. But [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1255.6200000000001s)]
*  then I started thinking about, you know, like, I would just always kind of be like, you know, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1260.02s)]
*  that's to me when I say throw my arm around him. I don't mean physically, by the way, I mean, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1263.46s)]
*  you know, like, metaphorically, I'm not touching college kids. The point is, I would have more of [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1267.38s)]
*  an attitude that it's like, well, hey, let me try to give you a little nugget of information or [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1272.3400000000001s)]
*  something like that. I don't think it's appropriate to ever have the attitude with college kids that [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1276.58s)]
*  like the way I debated Chris Cuomo or something like that, like, I'm here to destroy you. Like, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1282.42s)]
*  come on, that's not like, I'll have that attitude with Chris Cuomo. I'll have that attitude with [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1287.38s)]
*  the guy who was the number one show at CNN who sold the whole COVID agenda. Like, sure, that to [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1292.34s)]
*  me makes sense. It doesn't make sense for me to, you know, and that's what Ben Shapiro like got [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1297.9399999999998s)]
*  famous off that. They got famous off, you know, debating some 20 year old chick who thinks she's [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1302.34s)]
*  a dude and being like, Oh, are you really a guy? Well, then why aren't you a tree? And everyone's [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1309.22s)]
*  like, Oh, man, you destroyed her like, and then, but yet on this most crucial of issues, which [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1313.86s)]
*  clearly is like right at the center of your entire identity. I mean, the guys on record said [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1320.98s)]
*  that the reason he supports the United States of America is because we support Israel. And so like [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1327.38s)]
*  that just seems, that seems to me to be weak. Like you should, there should be an obligation [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1332.1s)]
*  for him to like debate someone competent on this issue. Then that's, you know, what I've been trying [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1337.3s)]
*  to do. It's part of the reason why I challenged Ben Shapiro and Douglas Murray. Neither of those guys [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1344.66s)]
*  you know, responded or accepted or anything, but I do feel like, you know, debating like that. I [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1351.6200000000001s)]
*  debated Dennis Prager. I mean, it was totally, again, totally one sided blowout. And I debated [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1358.1s)]
*  Josh Hammer, who's, I mean, the senior editor at Newsweek and has just wrote a book about Israel [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1364.9s)]
*  that's coming out soon. And so I'm kind of like, I'm kind of looking here like, okay, is this the [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1370.82s)]
*  best guys you got? Like who's the best guy you got? Who's willing to do this? Because I just, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1375.38s)]
*  at this point, after doing so many of them, it just seems like they just really don't have much. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1381.7s)]
*  They really don't have much. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1388.74s)]
*  today's show, which is Sheath Underwear, the best underwear you will ever own and long time sponsor [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1392.8200000000002s)]
*  of the Part of the Problem podcast. I love this product so much. I cannot recommend it highly [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1398.9s)]
*  enough. It is the best pair of boxer briefs I've ever had. My entire life I was getting like just [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1404.1s)]
*  whatever name brand six pack of boxer briefs. And I never really thought anything of it until [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1410.34s)]
*  Sheath came on as a sponsor and they sent me a couple pairs. They're like, try them on so you [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1416.98s)]
*  can talk about it when you read the ad read. And then I was like, these are the most comfortable [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1421.3799999999999s)]
*  pair of boxer briefs I've ever owned. And I threw out the rest of my underwear and just ordered [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1424.82s)]
*  it. And now it's all I wear. I'm telling you, go get a pair of them. They're just great. They're [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1430.02s)]
*  high quality. They just, you feel good. You feel better when you're in a nice pair of boxer briefs. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1434.34s)]
*  And of course, they've been a long time sponsor of the show. So that's reason enough to go support [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1439.3s)]
*  them. Go check them out at sheathunderwear.com and make sure you use the promo code problem20, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1443.54s)]

*  off. All right, let's get back into the show. What is it here in the comment? Kurt calling [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1456.18s)]
*  the Liberty attack a conspiracy theory is ridiculous. Even Israel admits it happened. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1461.8600000000001s)]
*  They just lie and say it's an accident. Yeah, I mean, you know, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1469.22s)]
*  the maybe like if there's no other takeaway from the last, the last few years of American politics, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1473.62s)]
*  it's like, even more so, you know, like if someone calls you like, you're a bigot, or you're a [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1488.26s)]
*  transphobe, or you're a racist, or whatever, it's just like, okay, that's not an argument. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1493.9399999999998s)]
*  It's just not an argument. And that should just be dismissed. Okay, what else you got? You know? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1498.82s)]
*  And same with conspiracy theorists. You know, just, just I mean, by the way, that if it was a [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1505.54s)]
*  conspiracy, if the USS Liberty is a conspiracy, they're like, yeah, it is a conspiracy theory, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1511.7s)]
*  I guess. It was one that was shared by the Secretary of State at the time. It's one that [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1516.58s)]
*  shared by a whole bunch of eyewitnesses to the event. So what does that mean? Yes, it's been a [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1521.06s)]
*  conspiracy to keep this a secret. Okay. I mean, like, I just don't, I find it bizarre that anybody, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1526.66s)]
*  especially someone as intelligent as Charlie Kirk, to just like over the after the last few years [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1533.78s)]
*  to say, well, that's a conspiracy. Like, okay, the question is whether the question is what happened, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1539.3000000000002s)]
*  not whether it's a conspiracy or not. And there are lots of conspiracies that are real. And I think [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1545.22s)]
*  Charlie would like acknowledge that, but I don't know. Okay, let me see. Douglas Murray, good name, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1550.58s)]
*  dude. Douglas Murray. It's crazy how he bragged about the one to one, the civilian to combatant [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1561.9399999999998s)]
*  ratio that can't be proven, even if I could. That's a lot of civilians to be comfortable killing. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1568.98s)]
*  Yeah, that was, you know, there were a few moments in the debate and that, you know, it's like, it's [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1576.6599999999999s)]
*  always the case with these debates where it's something I made my peace with. I think Gene [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1580.5s)]
*  Epstein actually helped me understand this because, so like I mentioned, Gene Epstein runs the Soho [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1584.82s)]
*  Forum debate. So Gene Epstein has done a ton of debates himself. He's one of the best. He's like [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1590.1799999999998s)]
*  really one of the absolute best debaters. If you've never seen Gene Epstein, there was a [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1596.82s)]
*  there was a Bhaskar Sankarya or something like that. He's like a democratic socialist guy. And [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1605.22s)]
*  they debated like free market capitalism versus democratic socialism or something like that. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1611.86s)]
*  I forget the exact resolution, but I mean, it is to this day, one of the best debate performances [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1616.74s)]
*  I've ever seen. Gene was just spectacular. He gets a little worked up and angry in the debate, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1622.98s)]
*  but I actually, I love that type of stuff, but it was just like phenomenal. So good. And then he had, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1627.22s)]
*  I'm blanking on the professor's name. Wolf, I think is his last name. He's like one of the more [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1634.5s)]
*  famous, Richard Wolf. He's one of the more like famous, like Marxist professors. And again, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1639.22s)]
*  Gene just tore him to shreds. So Gene's like a very experienced debater. And he's also a brilliant [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1646.1s)]
*  economist who's just, you know, very smart and well read and really has his arguments down. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1651.1399999999999s)]
*  And he also, he runs a debate series. So he's just like immersed in that world. And I remember he [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1657.06s)]
*  told me after my first debate, that was the one where I debated Nick Sarwalk at a Soho forum. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1662.66s)]
*  And then I won the debate pretty handily. But I remember after it being like, oh, I should have [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1670.3400000000001s)]
*  said this. And when he said that I should have said this. I go, oh, I'm like kicking myself because [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1677.3000000000002s)]
*  I could have made this point. And he, and he said to me, he goes something, I forget exactly how he [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1682.1000000000001s)]
*  said it. But he goes, he goes, look, that's always going to be the case. There's, you're never going [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1686.98s)]
*  to do a debate where you don't later think of one other thing you could have said or one other thing [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1692.98s)]
*  you should have said, you know, it's just, you just, you do the best you can in the moment. And [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1697.78s)]
*  then you kind of learn from that. So next time you make sure you say the point that you, you wish you [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1704.1s)]
*  had said this time, if it comes up again, that for this debate, that was one where I thought maybe I [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1708.34s)]
*  could have like really, really had a better response to, I mean, I think I just kind of scoffed at [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1715.54s)]
*  him and was like, you don't know that this is ridiculous. I mean, it's such a ridiculous claim [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1721.22s)]
*  when you really think about it, that they've killed one militant for every civilian that they've [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1725.78s)]
*  killed. How would you even make those numbers add up? Like it's just, it's ridiculous. How would you [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1732.1s)]
*  even, and I could have just either, I could have easily followed up and really grilled down. I'm like, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1737.86s)]
*  tell me exactly how your methodology works here that you've figured that out. But again, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1742.6599999999999s)]
*  you know, it's tough sometimes in these debates, it's a little bit tricky. You have to make a split [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1748.82s)]
*  second decision about what angle you want to go with this. And you always want it, like my focus [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1752.1799999999998s)]
*  on the debate was that I just wanted to make sure I won the resolution. Like the resolution was about [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1757.3s)]
*  the US Israeli relationship. And so it wasn't, I didn't want to get too sidetracked into how, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1762.98s)]
*  you know, horrible what Israel's doing is or something like that. Because I've done that in [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1768.66s)]
*  a lot of other debates and that wasn't the topic of this debate. And also he was making the argument [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1773.94s)]
*  essentially that he doesn't care about morality. He cares about what's good for our country. And [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1779.46s)]
*  so once you're making that argument, it's like, I'm not going to go down the whole path of convincing [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1785.0600000000002s)]
*  you that you should care about morality. I'm just going to argue that like, well, it's not good for [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1790.74s)]
*  the country either. So you lose by your own, you know, stated worldview. And, you know, another [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1795.46s)]
*  people, the other thing that people jumped on a lot, there was the one thing I thought he did that [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1802.5s)]
*  was somewhat bad faith and disingenuous was when he asked me that question about who I trust more, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1806.5s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu or Osama bin Laden, which I did think, you know, I don't, I just thought that was [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1812.98s)]
*  kind of ridiculous. But also I thought it was, it was, it was the only time that I really thought, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1821.54s)]
*  maybe there's something else I didn't exactly miss. It was the only time I thought during the [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1826.18s)]
*  debate where he was kind of being bad faith. He wasn't before or after the debate, like a shitty [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1829.86s)]
*  to me at all. And honestly, my takeaway from it, I'm curious what you guys thought, but [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1836.26s)]
*  I thought it actually backfired on him and just hurt him a lot because it was so transparently [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1845.86s)]
*  like this just doesn't make any sense. I mean, it's a, it's a, you know, he was, he basically said, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1850.34s)]
*  he goes, well, who do you trust more, Benjamin Netanyahu or Osama bin Laden? I was like, what? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1857.22s)]
*  It's like, I don't trust either of them. What does that mean? And I think, and he was like, well, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1862.34s)]
*  that says something right there that you can't just easily say you trust Netanyahu more than Osama [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1867.4599999999998s)]
*  bin Laden. And I was like, I don't really, I think most people are intelligent enough to know that [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1872.4199999999998s)]
*  creating a false binary and then insisting you pick one of them and then saying that says [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1879.14s)]
*  something about you doesn't really win you too many debate points. Adam says, yeah, that was dumb. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1884.3400000000001s)]
*  Just say now that you trust bin Laden more. Well, the thing is, look, it's not about [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1893.22s)]
*  trusting bin Laden more than Netanyahu. I don't think that's exactly right. I think the way [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1899.14s)]
*  to think about it, which is a little bit difficult to explain in the middle of a debate, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1906.58s)]
*  I think the way to think about it is a terrorist who's trying, who's openly saying, I declare war [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1910.6599999999999s)]
*  on you and I'm trying to kill and I'm targeting your civilians. You know, this was the Osama bin [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1920.82s)]
*  Laden logic, which is, you know, every bit as insane as Netanyahu's logic or George W. Bush's [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1925.86s)]
*  logic. But he said basically, because you have free elections in America and because you vote [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1932.18s)]
*  for the people who are at war with the Muslims, you're fair game now too. Now, okay, that's insane. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1937.54s)]
*  But again, by the way, I mean, just on Piers Morgan today, somebody kind of made that argument to me [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1943.54s)]
*  about the Palestinians. So it's, you know, this is, this is insane no matter who makes the argument. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1948.74s)]
*  But the point is that if a terrorist is making that argument, they don't, they're not incentivized [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1953.38s)]
*  to lie to you in the same type of way. Right. So it's not that like, I think Osama bin Laden is [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1958.5s)]
*  like a more honest person by nature. And sure, once you're a mass murderer, so this would apply [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1964.58s)]
*  to both of them. Once you're a mass murderer, yeah, you were way past the point of liar. You know, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1970.74s)]
*  I don't think you have like a moral code that won't allow you to lie. The point is that there's no [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1975.54s)]
*  reason for Osama bin Laden to be lying to us. He's already declared war against us. Netanyahu, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1980.18s)]
*  on the other hand, is trying to lobby us into a next war. So there's a lot more reason for him [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1985.14s)]
*  to lie to us, you know, so it's not, again, it's just such a clunky, weird question. I don't even [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1990.5800000000002s)]
*  really know what the answer is, other than what I said, which is that I don't trust either of them. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=1995.3000000000002s)]
*  What is it? The part, I'm sorry, Adam says, Oh man, the part where he said Saudi civilians lives [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2005.14s)]
*  don't matter was wild. Well, yeah, he said, well, it wasn't exactly that. But anyway, he said [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2010.9s)]
*  something about how like, he doesn't care about the morality at all of what they do to their own [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2018.3400000000001s)]
*  people. And I was like, yeah, well, I kind of do. Anyway, it was a fun time. It's always fun to win [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2023.0600000000002s)]
*  these things, you know, is that that's kind of maybe silly and just maybe somewhat immature on [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2032.9s)]
*  me. But I also do think that like, it's kind of important to demonstrate that it's like, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2038.82s)]
*  listen, I think that my camp is correct about this stuff. And I'm not again, like I said before, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2046.58s)]
*  I'm not taking any like, any credit for it. It's I've just read all the right people. And like, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2053.06s)]
*  I've done my homework, I'll say I've done my homework, I know my stuff. So I can do well in [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2060.42s)]
*  these debates, because you're not going to catch me in like some huge blind spot where I'm like, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2064.9s)]
*  oh, should I never thought about that? I don't have an answer to that. I don't know the reference [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2068.42s)]
*  he's making. So I've like done my reading. And these the guys that I've been persuaded by are [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2071.78s)]
*  just I was persuaded by them for a reason, because they have way better arguments. So anyway, I don't [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2078.5s)]
*  know who's next. But maybe you guys tell me who's the guy who's the best they got to come argue this. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2082.5s)]
*  I mean, you know, I'm taking on guys who have resumes that say they should be able to handle me. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2089.14s)]
*  So I don't I don't know who the next one is. But Douglas Murray, Ben Shapiro, I'd still be down [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2097.06s)]
*  to do either of those. I do I will say I give Josh a lot of credit because I do think like, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2103.14s)]
*  it's a risk on his part. It's a big risk to have like a resume like he has, and then come to be [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2108.8199999999997s)]
*  a comedian. You know, like that's like there's a that you're taking you're taking a big risk [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2115.8599999999997s)]
*  there. And so I do think that was a like, give him credit for that. Okay, Shapiro is the only [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2121.94s)]
*  one who will move the needle. Yep, that's true. But, or maybe that's not true. I don't know. I [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2130.58s)]
*  think the Douglas Murray one would be good. Constantine Kassin would be embarrassing. Well, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2137.46s)]
*  maybe. I mean, I'd be down to do that. We had talked about doing an Israel debate and kind of [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2145.46s)]
*  agreed to it, but we never made it work with the schedules. Maybe I'll reach back out and try to [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2150.26s)]
*  see if that if that would happen. But I, you know, I'd be happy to do that when we already debated [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2154.1800000000003s)]
*  about Ukraine. And we're going to talk about Ukraine here in a second. Okay. Okay, so this is [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2161.2200000000003s)]
*  Natalie pulled up this question. This is a good one. It transitions into something I wanted to [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2168.9s)]
*  talk about from the chat. Dave, what do you think Tulsi's priorities will be in the first year of [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2172.42s)]
*  that is that's an interesting question. I really don't know. Tulsi Gabbard, of course, if you guys [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2178.58s)]
*  don't, if you haven't seen she just a couple hours ago got confirmed. So that's a huge, huge deal. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2183.62s)]
*  One of the things that's very interesting about Tulsi Gabbard, and this is I know I've talked [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2191.14s)]
*  about this before on the show, but it's kind of now that it's a reality, and she's in there. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2197.94s)]
*  It's first of all, it just cannot be overstated how crazy it is that Tulsi is the head of the deep [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2204.18s)]
*  state now. I mean, that is the position of being director of national intelligence. She is the boss [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2209.22s)]
*  of the entire intelligence community. And the interesting thing about Tulsi Gabbard, right, is [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2214.1s)]
*  like, Tulsi Gabbard is not where I am on foreign policy. She's like maybe, maybe halfway like in [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2220.18s)]
*  between like, you know, an establishment, you know, you know, whatever the Obama, Joe Biden, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2230.82s)]
*  you know, their foreign policies over here, and my foreign policies over here. She's like halfway, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2237.78s)]
*  which is still a lot better than we ever had before. But for people who don't know this, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2243.94s)]
*  just to go over it quickly, right, there was basically the the war on terrorism right started [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2247.78s)]
*  the the war on terrorism right started in 2001. So in 2001, after 9-11, immediately in the weeks [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2254.1s)]
*  following 9-11, it started with like special ops in Afghanistan, taking out the Al Qaeda cells that [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2261.14s)]
*  were there. Then of course, there was the full invasion of Afghanistan. Then under false pretenses, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2268.74s)]
*  we said that Saddam Hussein was involved in 9-11, and that he had nuclear weapons. And so then we [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2275.54s)]
*  launched that war. And so now we're, we're fighting the war in Iraq. Now Tulsi goes and serves in this [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2282.1s)]
*  war, and she's embedded in a medical unit. So she's like, she's seeing firsthand the unbelievable [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2290.18s)]
*  consequences of that war. And so she's, you know, I mean, like, I don't know the exact details of it, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2297.38s)]
*  but imagine being embedded in a medical unit at the height of the fighting in Iraq, you're going [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2302.98s)]
*  to see some stuff. And so she really turned against that war. And the fact that we were lied [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2307.62s)]
*  into it. Now she joined, she voluntarily enlisted to go fight in that war, because she was with the [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2312.2599999999998s)]
*  war on terrorism. She was like, these terrorists attacked us, we're here to go kill these terrorists, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2317.7799999999997s)]
*  you know. But then what Tulsi really objected to was what's what what Sy Hirsch called the [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2322.66s)]
*  redirection. And this is around 2006, 2007, somewhere in there. So it started at the end of [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2331.86s)]
*  George W. Bush's term and continued through Obama's entire term. And essentially what happened was, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2341.94s)]
*  so if you remember what I said earlier, right, there were those Sharon guys who were concerned [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2348.98s)]
*  that we're going to overthrow Iraq first. No, we should overthrow Iran first. Well, why did they [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2354.42s)]
*  say that? Okay, because Iraq was, you know, Saddam Hussein was the dictator of Iraq, but the super [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2359.22s)]
*  majority of the country were Shiites. Okay, like 60% of the country were Shiites. And so Saddam is [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2366.8199999999997s)]
*  sitting on this this dictatorship, which is holding down a majority of the people. And so the idea [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2374.58s)]
*  that you're going to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and then you know, whatever, we'll have elections, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2381.3799999999997s)]
*  okay, well, who's going to win those elections, the Shiites are going to win that because they [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2385.7s)]
*  have the numbers. And Iran is also a Shiite country. So their thing was that, oh, no, you're [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2389.2999999999997s)]
*  going to hand this country to Iran, Iran's going to have total influence over this entire region. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2395.2999999999997s)]
*  And so essentially, right, they got persuaded by the neoconservatives and the Likudniks and [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2400.98s)]
*  the George W. Bush administration that don't worry about that. Because just like General Wesley Clark [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2410.2599999999998s)]
*  said, we're going to topple seven countries in five years, ending with Iran. So you don't have [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2415.3s)]
*  to worry about Iran having influence in the region, because we're going to overthrow them too. And it [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2420.5s)]
*  does seem to me that they, part of the reason why they went for this plan is because they actually [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2424.34s)]
*  believed what they were saying, which is that Iran in their own words, they said was going to be a [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2429.7000000000003s)]
*  cakewalk. And we were going to be greeted, this is what they used to say back then, we were going [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2433.7000000000003s)]
*  to be greeted as liberators, and the war would be paid for in oil, and it was going to be a cakewalk, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2437.94s)]
*  real quick, we'll just do this. So we'll get this one done and then do the next one. But it didn't [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2443.54s)]
*  end up being that, it ended up being a goddamn catastrophe. And so essentially, they never got [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2446.98s)]
*  the war in Iran, so they just handed influence to the Shiites. Now once Barack Obama came in, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2453.1400000000003s)]
*  and toward the end of the George W. Bush administration, by the way, there's an [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2459.78s)]
*  interesting footnote about this, is that Dick Cheney really tried to convince George W. Bush [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2463.3s)]
*  to go to war with Iran in 2007, I believe it was 2007. And just by this point, Bush was done [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2470.58s)]
*  listening to Dick Cheney. At this point, he had already been like, he had convinced him to go in [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2478.2599999999998s)]
*  these two wars, they were both disasters. He went from having record high job approval numbers after [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2484.34s)]
*  9-11 to being completely in the toilet, and he just wasn't listening to Dick Cheney anymore. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2490.42s)]
*  And then I think also the military told him, we cannot do this, is too much. So they couldn't do [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2494.58s)]
*  that. But what they settled for to now correct this balance of power was to flip sides. Instead of [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2499.86s)]
*  fighting the Sunnis, who were our enemies, I mean, radical Sunnis were the Bin Ladenites, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2511.46s)]
*  you know. Instead of attacking them, we were now going to switch and start attacking the Shiites [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2516.98s)]
*  to undo the mistake that George W. Bush made by giving them the entire country. But we couldn't [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2522.1800000000003s)]
*  just go in and, you know, you can just invade Iraq again, and then overthrow the government that we [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2529.06s)]
*  had just put into power, that one would be a little bit too transparent. And so this is where you get [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2536.2599999999998s)]
*  the Obama foreign policy. And in the Obama foreign policy, what are we trying to do? We're trying to [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2541.62s)]
*  overthrow Bashar al-Assad, who's aligned with Iran. So if Iran had influence in Iran, Syria and Iraq, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2546.18s)]
*  well, at least we could take out Syria from them. And this, we get now in what happened here, and [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2552.9s)]
*  Tulsi just knows enough to know, like, as Scott Horn always says, who the shirts and the skins are. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2559.06s)]
*  You know, to most people in America, when they say, you know, Iran is the number one sponsor of [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2566.82s)]
*  terrorism, they just think Al Qaeda, ISIS, Muslim terrorists, you know, isn't that what they are? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2572.34s)]
*  But no, those are the Sunni terrorists. Iran isn't sponsoring them. Iran is sponsoring, you know, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2578.42s)]
*  Hezbollah and Hamas and, you know, Israel's enemies, the Shiites. And so Israel was like, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2583.7000000000003s)]
*  really like, yeah, they did not like the idea that their real enemies, the Shiites, because those are [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2590.34s)]
*  the only ones who stand up for the poor Palestinians. They were all about, you know, this new tactic. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2594.42s)]
*  And so what Tulsi objected to was not the war on terrorism. He supported that and still does to this [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2602.34s)]
*  day, which is not great. You know, I oppose the entire war on terrorism. But Tulsi is really [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2611.2200000000003s)]
*  adamantly against the war for terrorism. She was really adamantly against Libya and Syria and Yemen, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2617.78s)]
*  because we were fighting on the same side as Al Qaeda. And that was the whole reason why she, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2625.06s)]
*  I mean, imagine from her perspective, you voluntarily enlisted because this group Al Qaeda [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2629.14s)]
*  attacked us. And then you're sitting there and you're fighting in Iraq and the entire Iraqi [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2633.54s)]
*  insurgency was Sunnis, right? These were the ones who Saddam Hussein was allied with. And so these [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2639.14s)]
*  were the ones who were fighting back against us. And of course, after we invaded Iraq, it drew in [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2648.66s)]
*  all of the Al Qaeda. This is what created Al Qaeda in Iraq. They went, okay, it's hard to cross the [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2653.62s)]
*  Atlantic Ocean and get to America to do another 9-11, but we could get over to Iraq and start, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2657.94s)]
*  you know, trying to shoot it and put some, you know, roadside bombs down to kill some Americans [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2663.38s)]
*  there. And so Tulsi is fighting against these people and then watching all these wars on behalf [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2668.82s)]
*  of them. This is why she went and met with Bashar al-Assad, because she knew the opposition was Al [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2673.14s)]
*  Qaeda, was ISIS. And so, you know, when they tell you in the mainstream media, sorry, I don't like [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2678.18s)]
*  to use that term, they tell you in the dead legacy media for all those years, right? Or like [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2683.62s)]
*  when someone like Barry Weiss goes, she's an Assad toady. She went to meet with Bashar al-Assad. Like, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2688.1s)]
*  as if, you know, if you look at that in a vacuum, you go, oh, there's this dictator and she wanted [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2693.8599999999997s)]
*  to go meet with him. Oh, that seems a little bit shady. But if you know what's going on, it's not [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2698.5s)]
*  shady at all. She did not like the fact that we were committing treason. I'm not being hyperbolic. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2702.8199999999997s)]
*  It's treason. You can't side with the enemy of your people during wartime. There's a punishment [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2708.82s)]
*  for that. And it's pretty severe. And so anyway, I guess I don't know that's a long way to answer [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2714.7400000000002s)]
*  your question. I don't know what Tulsi's agenda is going to be. I do know that Tulsi is well aware [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2721.6200000000003s)]
*  of the treason that was committed by the previous US presidents. That already just makes it very [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2728.42s)]
*  interesting because now going in already knowing that she's in charge of the entire intelligence [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2735.46s)]
*  apparatus. Now she's going to learn a lot more. And she also might choose what she wants to share [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2743.54s)]
*  with the American people. So anyway, all of that is very, very exciting. I think it also bodes well [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2749.2200000000003s)]
*  for Bobby Kennedy. It'll probably be a similar split. Also worth noting that Bernie Sanders [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2756.5s)]
*  voted against Tulsi Gabbard. So that's one of the great things coming out of all of this is just [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2763.06s)]
*  everybody learning what a fraud that guy always was. So a lot of positives, a lot of positives [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2768.02s)]
*  happening here. Okay. I do before we wrap up the show, I have to talk about some of these [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2772.66s)]
*  developments, which are very, very positive developments as it relates to the war in Ukraine. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2779.94s)]
*  This was one of, if not probably the strongest, most compelling reason to support Donald Trump [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2786.42s)]
*  is that he was just so much better than the previous administration on this issue. He had [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2795.62s)]
*  some great rhetoric around it on the campaign. And it really does seem like it always kind of [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2801.2200000000003s)]
*  seemed like he really does mean it when he says he wants the war to end. You have a very like the [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2806.9s)]
*  like a very big contrast between what Joe Biden or Kamala Harris would say about the war and have [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2815.46s)]
*  been saying about it for years. They would be saying, we can't give Vladimir Putin an inch. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2821.78s)]
*  We will fund Ukraine all the way. We're not stopping until Russia is completely driven out. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2827.7s)]
*  This is a ridiculous, unrealistic expectation. Donald Trump always said, which was really just [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2833.38s)]
*  the correct thing. I want the war to end. I want the killing to end. I want people to stop dying. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2839.14s)]
*  That it's funny because when he said this on CNN, I think this was almost two years ago now that he [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2845.54s)]
*  said this, this was like a considered a very controversial statement. And by the way, doesn't [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2851.2200000000003s)]
*  that say everything about the United States of America's government as it currently stands, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2857.14s)]
*  that that is considered a controversial statement. I mean, what more can I even add to that? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2860.9s)]
*  Anyway, I want to play this video from Defense Secretary Pete Haggiseth. So yeah, let's play the [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2866.5s)]
*  Pete Haggiseth video because he just said this and then I'll read Donald Trump's tweet about it. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2873.3s)]
*  The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2878.98s)]
*  of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2886.42s)]
*  and non-European troops. If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2894.5800000000004s)]
*  they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and they should not be covered under [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2901.38s)]
*  Article 5. There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact. To be clear, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2907.54s)]
*  as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2916.42s)]
*  So, I mean, it's hard to stress how great it is to hear something like that from the Defense [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2922.8999999999996s)]
*  Secretary of the United States of America. And, you know, Pete Haggiseth has been kind of one of [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2931.62s)]
*  the question marks for me. I, you know, there were, Donald Trump had some picks that I hated. He had [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2939.22s)]
*  some picks that I loved. So, like, in the hated category is like Marco Rubio and Ratcliffe. In [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2947.3s)]
*  the love category is like Tulsi and Bobby Kennedy and Cash Patel and what was the other one? Blanking [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2954.6600000000003s)]
*  on oh, I'm Baticharia. Pete Haggiseth was always kind of a question to me because he was like when [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2964.6600000000003s)]
*  I knew Pete, which, you know, I like I didn't know him super well, but like I've done a few [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2972.5s)]
*  like Fox News shows with him and I've we went out for beers like after one of our shows once. And [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2977.14s)]
*  so from what I've known of him, he was like really a neocon. The Pete Haggiseth that I knew was like [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2983.3s)]
*  had awful foreign policy. And so that that was concerning to me because I literally I mean, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2990.66s)]
*  I had private conversations with the guy where he said some things that I was not happy about. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=2995.3s)]
*  But the word was that he's really changed his mind on a lot of this stuff. And he's really kind [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3001.62s)]
*  of opened up to the idea that these wars were all a big mistake. And and look, there's there's a weird [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3007.2999999999997s)]
*  thing that happens with this dynamic because you kind of don't know. I mean, look, I talked to a [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3012.5s)]
*  lot of military guys. There's a lot of military guys who listen to the show. And I talked to many [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3018.42s)]
*  of them like, you know, after shows and at different, you know, events and stuff like that. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3023.06s)]
*  And there's a ton of people like that. I mean, there's a ton of people who were like all gung ho [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3027.54s)]
*  on the wars and then woke up. You know, again, this was this was true by 2008. It was true by [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3032.82s)]
*  2012. As you guys I always like to bring this statistic up because it's very interesting. But [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3040.66s)]
*  in 2008 and 2012, the presidential candidate who got more money from active duty military than [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3046.42s)]
*  every other candidate combined, not just the most money from active duty military, but more [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3053.38s)]
*  money than every other candidate put together, including Barack Obama, was Ron Paul. The active [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3059.94s)]
*  duty military guys were going for the the most hardcore anti-war pro-peace candidate. And that's [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3066.6600000000003s)]
*  because they have to they're the ones who actually have to pay the cost. You know what I mean? These [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3073.2200000000003s)]
*  are the guys whose lives are ruined, who watched their, you know, their buddy bleed out in their [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3076.42s)]
*  lap screaming for his mom. These are the ones who are having nightmares about the shit they did [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3080.9s)]
*  over there, you know. So it makes sense that there are a lot of people who really change their minds [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3085.2200000000003s)]
*  on this. However, at the same time, when you got a guy who's a Fox News host, and the sentiment of [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3089.38s)]
*  the Republican Party totally went from gung ho for war to totally skeptical of this type of a [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3095.62s)]
*  permanent war, you wonder like, did he really have a change of heart? Or is he just saying the thing [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3103.94s)]
*  that's very popular for his viewers right now? So this is a great start. Let's just say that very, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3111.14s)]
*  very good start for Pete Hegseth. And it's just, I don't know, it's, it's hard to say, but it's, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3116.82s)]
*  it's just fantastic. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3123.78s)]
*  which is Prolon by El Nutra. Prolon by El Nutra is the only patented fasting mimicking diet that [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3128.58s)]
*  combines the benefits of prolonged fasting with a science-backed nutrition plan so you can hit your [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3136.58s)]
*  health and weight loss goals without actually having to give up all that food. If you're feeling [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3142.66s)]
*  sluggish or low energy or unfocused, you really should consider this. It's a revolutionary plant [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3147.22s)]
*  based nutrition program that nourishes the body while making cells believe they are fasting. It's [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3152.8199999999997s)]
*  researched and developed for decades in the University of Southern California's Longevity [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3158.02s)]
*  Institute and backed by leading U.S. medical centers. Prolon helps promote healthy blood sugar, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3162.34s)]
*  supports cardiovascular health, and reduces abdominal fat. But Prolon isn't a diet. Prolon [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3168.02s)]
*  is science, science based on Nobel Prize winning discoveries in medicine. And this all starts with [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3174.02s)]
*  Prolon's five-day program. Snacks, soups, beverages, all designed to keep your body in a fasting state. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3180.02s)]
*  It's unlike anything you've ever experienced. If you're anything like me guys, you've heard the [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3186.66s)]
*  benefits of all of these fasting diets, but I'm never going to do that. I'm never going to be [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3191.2999999999997s)]
*  able to just fast and give up food. Now because of Prolon, you don't have to. You can kind of get [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3195.7799999999997s)]
*  both. So right now Prolon is offering part of the problem listeners 15% off their five-day nutrition [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3200.18s)]

*  this special offer. ProlonLife.com slash POTP for 15% off. All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3216.98s)]
*  Okay, I want to read this because this was Donald Trump's tweet on the same subject. He tweeted this [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3224.5s)]
*  after that comment by Pete Hegseth. This is from Donald Trump. He says, I just had a lengthy and [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3233.62s)]
*  highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. We discussed Ukraine, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3239.54s)]
*  the Middle East, energy, artificial intelligence, the power of the dollar, and various other subjects. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3244.3399999999997s)]
*  We both reflected on the great history of our nations and the fact that we fought so successfully [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3249.38s)]
*  together in World War II, remembering that Russia lost tens of millions of people and we likewise [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3254.5s)]
*  lost so many. We each talked about the strengths of our respective nations and the great benefit [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3260.42s)]
*  that we will someday have in working together. But first, as we both agreed, we want to stop [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3267.94s)]
*  the millions of deaths taking place in the war with Russia and Ukraine. President Putin even used my [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3273.38s)]
*  very strong campaign motto of common sense. We both believe very strongly in it. We agreed to [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3279.14s)]
*  work together very closely, including visiting each other's nations. We have also agreed to have [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3285.3s)]
*  our respective teams start negotiating immediately. And we will begin by calling President Zelensky of [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3290.42s)]
*  Ukraine to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3297.1400000000003s)]
*  I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe, National [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3302.6600000000003s)]
*  Security Advisor, Michael Waltz, another terrible one, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3307.38s)]
*  Witkoff, a good one, to lead the negotiations, which I feel strongly will be successful. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3314.34s)]
*  Millions of people have died in a war that would not have happened if I were president, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3325.38s)]
*  but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost. I want to thank President Putin [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3330.7400000000002s)]
*  for his time and effort with respect to this call and for the release yesterday of Mark Fogel, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3336.34s)]
*  a wonderful man that I personally greeted last night at the White House. I believe this effort [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3342.34s)]
*  will lead to a successful conclusion, hopefully soon. I mean, I don't know. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3347.06s)]
*  I just can't overstate how great this is. And I understand the war hasn't ended yet. You know, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3355.3s)]
*  this is rhetoric, but it is such an improvement from where we were. It's really, you know, even [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3361.3s)]
*  just a year ago, but especially a couple years ago, it is, yeah, I mean, it's time for this [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3366.66s)]
*  catastrophe to end. And I got to say, you know, it's like, you know, as I was kind of talking [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3373.2999999999997s)]
*  about on the show yesterday, it almost, it seems like I'm just in the business about, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3379.22s)]
*  like I'm just in the business of being right about stuff. And it's, look, it's just, I mean, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3385.94s)]
*  I don't mean just to like pat my own back here. I realize I'm doing a little too much of that [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3393.7000000000003s)]
*  this episode, so I apologize. But it's like so many of us who were pushing in real time [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3398.34s)]
*  for to take a deal. I mean, the deal that Zelensky was essentially forced out of accepting by [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3405.54s)]
*  Boris Johnson and Joe Biden, or whoever was really making the decisions, you know, Anthony [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3413.86s)]
*  Blinket, whatever, they had a much better deal on the table. And we were saying, just take this [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3419.06s)]
*  deal and end the war now. And all of the hawks said, no, that would be a too big of a concession. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3425.86s)]
*  And we have to drive Vladimir Putin completely out of Ukraine, something that everybody involved, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3433.7799999999997s)]
*  who knows anything about it knows, the only way to actually do that would be to deploy the full [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3439.7799999999997s)]
*  U.S. military and have a direct hot war with the biggest nuclear power in the world. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3444.66s)]
*  We're not going to do that. Even Joe Biden wasn't ever prepared to do that. And so now, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3450.42s)]
*  what we got as a result of not taking this deal, like once again, one more war that the hawks got [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3457.06s)]
*  completely wrong. So now, instead of doing what we all suggested at the time, we listened to the [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3463.2999999999997s)]
*  hawks. And so hundreds of thousands more people died and Ukraine's going to end up with a worse [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3471.14s)]
*  deal. This is a goddamn, like of all of the wars over the last 25 years, this is probably got to [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3477.22s)]
*  take first place as being the one that was the easiest to negotiate away. The easy, I mean, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3487.7799999999997s)]
*  literally, the head of NATO, Stoltenberg, I know I'm butchering his name, I'm sorry, I should at [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3495.94s)]
*  one point learn how to say his name, but I just don't really have that much respect for him. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3505.38s)]
*  Anyway, but Stoltenberg himself admitted that before Vladimir Putin invaded, he said to NATO, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3511.14s)]
*  he goes, if you just put it in writing that you won't bring Ukraine into NATO, I won't invade. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3518.42s)]
*  But if you don't give me that in writing, I'm going to invade the country. And Stoltenberg bragged [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3526.18s)]
*  about how he said we refused, because we're not going to be bullied by Vladimir Putin or something [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3531.86s)]
*  like that. This was the simple ask that Vladimir Putin had. And what a reasonable ask. That doesn't [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3536.9s)]
*  mean like he's still wrong for invading and he killed a whole lot of people. And that's just [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3543.78s)]
*  totally unjustified. And he's he's a war criminal, just like all the US presidents are war criminals, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3548.34s)]
*  too. And I have no love for Vladimir Putin. But I'm sorry, the starting point of just asking, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3553.78s)]
*  like just saying you cannot bring our biggest neighboring country into your military alliance [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3559.6200000000003s)]
*  is totally reasonable. We would have the exact same demand. There is no way the United States [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3565.3s)]
*  of America would allow Mexico or Canada or Cuba to join a military alliance with China or Russia. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3570.98s)]
*  There's just no way, no conceivable way we could allow that to happen, because no regime can allow [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3577.78s)]
*  that. And so you just look at this. And now, I mean, Trump's saying millions, I don't know if [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3583.06s)]
*  the numbers actually in millions, but it's certainly in the hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3589.62s)]
*  of people have died. Vladimir Putin is going home with chunks of Ukraine. He's going to keep part of it. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3594.74s)]
*  And we got our defense secretary up there saying, yeah, and we NATO is not going to be a part of [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3601.38s)]
*  this. So essentially, we're giving not only did all these people die and all this territory was lost, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3605.62s)]
*  but he's getting the thing he wanted anyway. We could have just given him that and avoided [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3612.02s)]
*  this whole thing. This will go down in history as one of the most easily avoidable catastrophes [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3616.5s)]
*  in post-World War II European history. Just a goddamn tragedy. But anyway, really, really good [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3624.9s)]
*  the message that Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth are sending here. So that is something to be really [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3633.78s)]
*  happy about such a huge improvement from where we were. All right, I got to wrap up the show there. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3639.78s)]
*  Thank you guys for listening. Catch you guys tomorrow for the members only episode. I love you all. Goodbye. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h5C4dJ6FY&t=3644.1000000000004s)]
