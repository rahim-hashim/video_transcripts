**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8)
*  What's up? What's up? Welcome everybody to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith and today I am thrilled to welcome back to the show the great Dave DeCamp, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  who of course is the news editor over at antiwar.com and he's also the host of Antiwar Radio is [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=18.88s)]
*  the name of the show. Is that right? Antiwar News is the antiwar news. I'm sorry. Antiwar [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  News. So somebody Dave, as I've said both to you and behind your back publicly and privately, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=30.16s)]
*  somebody who has been like a tremendous resource for me over the years. If you go to antiwar.com [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=37.92s)]
*  as I do every day, Dave is always writing something just about every day, it seems multiple [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=44.0s)]
*  things most days to just kind of keep you up to pace with the latest of what's going on in in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=48.96s)]
*  foreign wars and very, you know, fortunately for you, it's been business has been busy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=55.04s)]
*  So you have not if you had the concern that you were going to be put out of business because [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=61.36s)]
*  there just wouldn't be too many foreign wars going on. No, that that problem you don't have [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=66.0s)]
*  to worry about. But anyway, thank you so much for taking the time to join us once again. How are you? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=70.32s)]
*  I'm good, Dave. Thanks so much for having me. It's an honor to be speaking with the leader of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=75.12s)]
*  woke right. That's right. I didn't it wasn't the job I was applying for. But you know, sometimes [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=80.64s)]
*  sometimes they just find you. But yes, of course. Well, you're a good you're a valuable member of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  this woke right. This we have these wild woke views like, you know, don't go on government [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=92.8s)]
*  mass murder sprees unless you really have to, which is so it's basically critical race theory [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=98.32s)]
*  right there. So you you had pitched me on the idea, which I very quickly jumped on, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=104.24s)]
*  but that we should do an episode really kind of, you know, talking about what's been going on [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=110.16s)]
*  in Yemen in Trump's campaign against the Houthis there. You had made the point just off air before [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  we started here that it really is kind of amazing how little attention this this conflict is getting. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  It's like it feels like only if you live in the United States of America, or Israel, perhaps, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=129.44s)]
*  is it just kind of like a normal thing to go on bombing campaigns? It's not even like big news, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=136.96s)]
*  you'd think for most countries, that'd be like a really big deal if you started dropping bombs on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  another country. For us, it seems to be very run of the mill. Yeah, yeah. And what's been happening [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=148.8s)]
*  in Yemen over the past month for about a month and a half now has been some of the heaviest bombing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=154.96s)]
*  that we've seen in the country over the past, you know, 10 years. And this is a country, you know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  I really liked your post when Trump started this bombing campaign again, because you said something [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=165.44s)]
*  that I thought was great, that the good news is there is a diplomatic solution that a ceasefire [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=172.0s)]
*  in Gaza. I mean, that's what what this is all over. But as you know, we know the US has been [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  bombing Yemen heavily for a long time, really starting in 2009 with Obama's drone wars. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=182.72s)]
*  Now, I believe the first US airstrike was launched in Yemen under George W. Bush, but Obama really [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=189.04s)]
*  ramped things up against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And these were, you know, when we talk [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=193.6s)]
*  about when people talk about Obama's drone wars and all the extrajudicial killings and bombing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=198.64s)]
*  weddings, a lot of it is Yemen, you know, a lot of the most horrific atrocities committed by Obama [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=204.16s)]
*  went down in Yemen. And then in 2015, that was when the Saudis, the UAE and other Arab countries [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=210.0s)]
*  formed this coalition to go after the Houthis, who are officially known as Ansarullah. They took over [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=217.52s)]
*  the capital and the US backed them in this war, even though a few months earlier, as Scott Horton [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=223.28s)]
*  always likes to point out, the US was cooperating with the Houthis against Al Qaeda. This is a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=230.4s)]
*  familiar pattern that we see around the region, especially in Syria, where we end up siding with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=235.36s)]
*  Al Qaeda. So, you know, the background there is from 2015 to 2022 about the US backed horrifically [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=239.84s)]
*  brutal war bombing campaign, ground campaign blockade, you know, on scale with the barbarity [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=249.36s)]
*  that we've seen in Gaza. And this went on throughout the whole first Trump administration. I know it's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  an issue you've been very good on and talked about a lot. I remember there was a clip, you went on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=261.76s)]
*  Joe Rogan and like the clip they put on YouTube was you talking about this history that I'm [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=266.0s)]
*  talking about now. So I know you're aware of this, most of your viewers are like, you know, what [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=270.96s)]
*  we're dealing with here, all this context, but most people just aren't. So then when Trump starts [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=275.84s)]
*  bombing them again, and they say, oh, it's to protect shipping lanes, and everybody kind of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  falls in line. And I mean, I even see libertarians saying, well, we got to protect the shipping [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=286.4s)]
*  lanes, you know, isn't that the purpose of the US Navy? And so like the other important historical [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=290.8s)]
*  context here for what's happening now is that after October 7, after Israel unleashed its brutal [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  bombing campaign on Gaza, the Houthis started targeting Israeli shipping, essentially declaring [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  like a blockade on Israeli shipping in the Red Sea. And in January 2024, President Biden launched [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  a new bombing campaign in Yemen against the Houthis with the UK. And as I predicted at the time, and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=315.36s)]
*  and it wasn't very hard for me to predict anybody who knew anything about Yemen and the Houthis knew [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=321.44s)]
*  that like a limited bombing campaign isn't going to stop them, if anything, it's going to embolden [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=326.48s)]
*  them and rally their supporters around them. They're trying to make a name for themselves [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=331.92s)]
*  as like the only Arabs really standing up for the Palestinians. And so after a year that nothing [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=336.16s)]
*  stopped the attacks, in fact, they expanded their attacks to start targeting American and British [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=342.56s)]
*  shipping. And then after a year, they did stop their attacks. Well, what got them to stop was [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=347.12s)]
*  a ceasefire in Gaza on January 19, they stopped. And in early March, when Israel imposed a total [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=353.04s)]
*  blockade on Gaza, not letting any food in, which they're still, you know, that's still in effect, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=361.92s)]
*  complete violation of the ceasefire deal, the Houthis announced that they're going to reimpose [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=366.8s)]
*  their blockade on Israeli shipping. And just a few days later, the Trump administration unleashes [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=370.72s)]
*  this really, you know, heavy bombing campaign much heavier than what Biden was doing. And again, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=376.72s)]
*  they're doing this instead of just making Israel implement that ceasefire deal that it signed in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=384.16s)]
*  January, instead of just, you know, cutting off the aid to Israel. I mean, that's the key here to the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  regional calm. So, I mean, that's, again, the important context here. So when we see people [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=395.12s)]
*  say, oh, they got to stop attacking US ships, actually, the Houthis, a senior member of the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=400.56s)]
*  Ansar Alaw Political Bureau said, told DropSite News that they would be willing to agree to a [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=405.12s)]
*  ceasefire with the US will stop attacking your warships. If you stop bombing Yemen, I tried to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  get the State Department, the Pentagon, the National Security Council to answer that, you know, would [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=417.04s)]
*  you consider a deal like that? And I never heard back and they do actually usually get back to me. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=421.84s)]
*  So, I mean, this is just the reality, you know, Hegseth and Trump say if the Houthis stop targeting [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=426.64s)]
*  American ships, we'll stop bombing Yemen. Well, here they are saying we will stop. But they're [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=431.28s)]
*  also saying they're going to continue the blockade on Israel. And that's what this is really about. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=437.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, so it's like, I really think that, you know, the point that I've tried to make about [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=441.76s)]
*  this like more recently, you know, like, but when you mentioned, you know, me talking about [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=447.92s)]
*  this on Joe Rogan's podcast a few years ago, I mean, the point I was making at the time was like, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=452.48s)]
*  we should stop doing this. Like, it was still going on. And I was like, we should stop doing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  this. This is horrible. I mean, it's just like, you know, horrifically immoral to bring this type [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=463.6s)]
*  of destruction on the poorest country in the Middle East for no strategic reason other than what Obama [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  officials stated that it was like, oh, this helps our relationship with the Saudis or something like [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=476.24s)]
*  that, which is, you know, insane. But I think today, when we bring it up, it's more important [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=480.32s)]
*  to understand the point that you were making in there that this is not going to defeat the Houthis. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you're kind of like me in this that when, you know, when you first saw the Houthis [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=494.08s)]
*  enter this fight, when they made it clear that they were going to stick up for the Palestinians, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=502.56s)]
*  there is part of you that's like, oh, God, no, because Jesus, like the people of Yemen have [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=507.6s)]
*  just been through so much and you know, one way or the other, whether it's justified or not, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=513.28s)]
*  this is going to bring even more, you know, destruction toward Yemen. But the point is that [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=517.76s)]
*  if they made it through the seven or eight years of a Saudi invasion, a total blockade, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=524.48s)]
*  these massive bombing campaigns, they made it through, I mean, you know, it was what was [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=531.84s)]
*  considered by the UN and many other humanitarian organizations to be the worst humanitarian crisis [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=536.88s)]
*  in the world through all of those years. And that didn't unseat the Houthis. Then it's just a joke [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=541.6s)]
*  to think that that launch in a few tomahawks is going to like get them to wave the white flag. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  And so you have on one hand, very clearly, there is not a military solution short of another war [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=553.44s)]
*  in Iraq. Like, I mean, I think certainly if the US wanted to invade Yemen, we could overthrow the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=560.8s)]
*  Houthis. As we learned from all these terror wars, we'd probably have other problems to deal with [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=566.56s)]
*  insurgencies and whatnot. But yeah, I mean, if we want to go spend another $3 trillion and lose [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=572.16s)]
*  another, you know, few thousand US soldiers and maybe have 10 or 20,000 more commit suicide in [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  the aftermath. Okay, we could do that. That's one option. The other option would be the ceasefire [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=585.04s)]
*  that I mean, you just can't overstate this, that Trump's envoy negotiated or at least got done, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=593.5999999999999s)]
*  I guess it was basically the same ceasefire that had been kicked around for quite a bit. But it [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  just seems so obvious like not that it's like, Oh, look what if it was any other country, and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=604.24s)]
*  Trump's envoy, Witkoff here was able to work out this ceasefire, and then one country started [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=610.24s)]
*  violating it and it causes more problems for us that they're not living up to it just be so obvious [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=615.04s)]
*  what the answer is here. It's only because it's Israel that this is even the conversation goes [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=620.24s)]
*  to like, Well, then I guess we got to fight this war for them. Yeah, yeah. And I mean, as he mentioned, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  you know, the Trump administration, they took this as a big victory in the first few weeks that they [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=632.72s)]
*  got the ceasefire. Right now, Israel's completely abrogated that deal. And you know, we see this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=636.8s)]
*  daily slaughter happening every day, and they're literally starving children now. I mean, there's [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=642.24s)]
*  no debating that they're not using starvation as a weapon of war now that they haven't let any food [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=646.88s)]
*  in in almost two months. And what we've seen in Yemen, so he mentioned during the Saudi war, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=651.76s)]
*  the Houthis survived that they didn't just survive it, they actually got better at fighting. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  And the thing that really made the Saudis in the UAE sue for peace was the fact that Houthi [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=663.2s)]
*  missile and drones started hitting oil fields and oil infrastructure deep inside Saudi Arabia and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=667.44s)]
*  in the UAE, they hit some targets there as well. And we're seeing a familiar pattern here in the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=672.48s)]
*  US bombing campaign just in recent weeks, the Houthis have shot down seven US MQ-9 Reaper drones, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=678.88s)]
*  which are these big drones, they're used for surveillance that can be used to launch airstrikes. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=685.0400000000001s)]
*  And they've downed a total of 21 of these drones since October 2023, but seven just in recent weeks [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  in US officials have been telling the media that they're actually getting better at targeting them. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=697.44s)]
*  And the US also just lost an F-18 overboard off an aircraft carrier that apparently, the aircraft [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  carrier, the Harry Truman had to make a hard turn to avoid a Houthi attack. So, you know, US warships [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=708.32s)]
*  have incredibly advanced air defense systems, but it almost seems like, you know, it's only a matter [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=714.0s)]
*  of time before a Houthi drone makes it through and then we might see some American casualties [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  and then what happens. So it seems like in response to this, to these airstrikes not working, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=725.04s)]
*  they're just ramping them up. The US military or the Pentagon put out this press release on the [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  first 100 days of the Trump administration, and somehow they were bragging about bombing Yemen. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=735.76s)]
*  They said that they struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen in just a, again, like a month and a [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=740.08s)]
*  half, a little less than that. And they've killed hundreds of civilians. These have been, you know, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=746.72s)]
*  some of the most brutal airstrikes we've seen in Yemen. On April 17th, the US bombed a fuel port [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=753.0400000000001s)]
*  in Hodeidah, the Red Sea province, and killed, according to the Yemen Data Project, which tracks [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  this stuff, killed 80 civilians. And this is mostly port workers. I mean, this is a massacre on a [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=764.48s)]
*  huge scale. And barely anyone has noticed in the US, at least, obviously, people in Yemen are very [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=770.24s)]
*  aware. And there's also just the other day on Monday, they bombed a migrant detention facility [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=776.08s)]
*  in northern Yemen and killed 68 people. And it looks like they're all African migrants. And the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=782.96s)]
*  real, you know, what reason, why would the US bomb this facility? I don't think the US would [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=788.5600000000001s)]
*  intentionally slaughter a bunch of African migrants. But how bad is their intelligence [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=793.36s)]
*  that they would bomb this? The really kind of egregious thing about it is that the Saudis bombed [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=797.92s)]
*  the same place three years ago, in January 2022, right before the ceasefire between the Houthis and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=801.6s)]
*  the Saudis. As I understand it, it was a different building, but it's like the same facility. And the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=806.4s)]
*  Saudis killed 91 civilians in that strike, 91 African migrants. Three years later, the US bombs [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=812.32s)]
*  the same place. And they claim, oh, we're having incredible success. We're killing all these Houthi [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=817.52s)]
*  fighters and taking care of their air defenses and everything. But I mean, it's just they have [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=822.72s)]
*  no way of knowing that. They don't really have people on the ground. I saw at one point a statement [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=828.96s)]
*  from the CENTCOM spokesman said something like, oh, we've killed hundreds of their militants, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=834.64s)]
*  you know, based on open source reporting. Well, open source reporting means it's just what you [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=839.76s)]
*  can find on the internet. I mean, it goes to show they just don't know what they're bombing, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=844.24s)]
*  and their solution is just bomb away. So yeah, it's really criminal what's happening here. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=847.28s)]
*  It's completely unauthorized. This is an important point here, because you see people justifying it, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=852.88s)]
*  saying, oh, the War Powers Act lets the president, you know, engage in military action for two months [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=857.92s)]
*  if there's an imminent, you know, under an emergency, if there's an imminent threat. Well, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=863.28s)]
*  that signal chat showed us that there was no imminent threat. They were saying, you know, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  JD Vance said, hey, maybe we should put these plans on the shelf for about a month, work on the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=871.28s)]
*  messaging. And Pete Hegseth, who was, you know, wanted to do it right away, even said that if, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=876.08s)]
*  you know, you wanted a pause, we could pause it. And, you know, and he was the one arguing in favor [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=882.08s)]
*  of doing it. So that shows there was no imminent threat. So it's completely illegal. It's immoral. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=886.5600000000001s)]
*  It's failing. And it's only being done to ensure Israel can keep killing Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=891.36s)]
*  So this is really just, I think, one of the worst things happening right now, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=896.8000000000001s)]
*  under this new Trump administration. Sorry, I don't mean to smirk as you say that, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=902.0s)]
*  but there was something in that that just seemed like almost what should be the tagline for US [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=907.2s)]
*  foreign policy. It describes all of it. It's illegal. It's immoral. It's not working. And [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=912.32s)]
*  it's only being done for Israel. That seems to kind of describe every military action that I can [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=919.36s)]
*  remember over the last 25 years. And, you know, it's wildly frustrating that really, I mean, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=925.84s)]
*  the only reason anyone's even talking about this on a, when I say anyone, obviously there are the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=935.76s)]
*  there are people who care about this, but broadly speaking amongst the American, you know, conversation [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=941.12s)]
*  is because of this signal gate thing. And like, still, it seems like the story there, the scandal [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=946.96s)]
*  is just that this Atlantic pack journalists happened to be added to the signal chat. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=953.04s)]
*  And I've been saying from the beginning that exactly your point, the real scandal here was [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=958.64s)]
*  that portion of the chat where JD Vance offers the most impotent pushback, but I guess I should give [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=963.36s)]
*  him credit for being the only one who seemed to offer any pushback where he does kind of say, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=973.28s)]
*  he does say, I think we're making a mistake. I think this is everything against what we ran on. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=978.48s)]
*  But then goes, I mean, Hey, I'll be, I'm totally on board if you guys want to do it. But then [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=984.72s)]
*  Hague's right. You said Hague Seth in response to him goes, I get your point. You know, I get what [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  you're saying. And look, this isn't time sensitive. We don't have to do this right now. And so in other [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=994.88s)]
*  words, right, they, the, look, the war powers act. And I'm, I think it was, I think Rothbard [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1000.24s)]
*  had a piece on this where it was like, look, the war's power, war powers act was horrible [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1006.88s)]
*  because the, it basically just gave the president the authority for two months or 90 days or whatever [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1010.88s)]
*  it gives you to start a war, you know, and it's like, it was already in the constitution that you [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1016.16s)]
*  need the Congress. So we shouldn't have even added that. But even within the wars powers act, it's [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1021.28s)]
*  like, yes, the threat has to be imminent. And so, no, you don't, if you have the option to seek [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1026.96s)]
*  congressional approval, you don't have the right to just launch military operations. But like, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1032.24s)]
*  it's crazy that that never even comes up as a thought. Nobody even thinks to themselves, oh, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1037.76s)]
*  well, if we don't have to do this right away, then we have to go to Congress and get approval [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  for this. Just not even, not even a thought anymore. Yeah. And I think that's a big risk [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1047.36s)]
*  here when, you know, we talk about the potential for war with Iran. Like it's not like they're [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1052.32s)]
*  going to have to do this big media thing like they did with Iraq and this buildup to like get [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1056.72s)]
*  the public on board, they could just bomb Iran. I mean, like that's just the way that the executive [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1061.6s)]
*  branch operates now. So yeah, I mean, this is something when it comes to Yemen that I think, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1066.9599999999998s)]
*  you know, we've seen some like very mild pushback from some members of the Senate. I know Rand Paul [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  joined the letter questioning the authorization. And there was another letter from like three [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1082.0s)]
*  Senate Democrats about the civilian casualties. But they didn't even say like challenge the fact [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1086.32s)]
*  that the US was bombing Yemen. They're basically just saying you should try to limit civilian [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1091.04s)]
*  casualties. So yeah, I mean, the sad truth is, is that if they did go to Congress, they would get [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1094.72s)]
*  the approval, but still it is still illegal what what they're doing right now in Yemen. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1100.0s)]
*  And the next possible escalation is backing a ground offensive against the Houthis, which would [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1106.0s)]
*  essentially be restarting the war that the Saudis failed at. You know, there's these factions on the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1111.6s)]
*  ground saying that they have like 80,000 fighters or something. But I don't even think that would be [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1116.96s)]
*  enough because if you've seen what's happening in Yemen, you know, the Houthi leader has been [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1120.88s)]
*  calling for these rallies. And I mean, these pictures from the Capitol, like, 100, it looks [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1125.0400000000002s)]
*  like hundreds of thousands of people come out. And a lot of them have AK 47s, like they're, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1129.44s)]
*  this is again, you know, really emboldening the Houthis and making them this kind of resistance [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1134.24s)]
*  faction that they that they really want to be. So if we continue down this path of escalation, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1140.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's just going to be just such a disaster. And, but again, it just doesn't seem [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1145.6000000000001s)]
*  like anybody's learning this lesson in the administration, even though one of the best [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1150.32s)]
*  arguments against bombing Yemen, when Biden started doing it, doing it was written by Mike [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1154.24s)]
*  Domino, who right now is the head of Middle East policy in the Pentagon. So unfortunately, it looks [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1159.28s)]
*  like, you know, his views are not winning the day, even though right now we still haven't had a [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1164.0s)]
*  strike on Iran. I think that risk is pretty high. And it's just a shame that a guy like [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1168.6399999999999s)]
*  Domino doesn't seem to be steering the policy. Well, or how about a guy like Donald Trump? I [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1175.92s)]
*  mean, Donald Trump said, I'm sure you've seen the clip, but when Tim pool had him on, he did get this [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1180.96s)]
*  amazing sound bite out of Donald Trump. And it was right. It was right after Joe Biden had just bombed [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1188.5600000000002s)]
*  Yemen for the same reason. And Donald Trump went off on how stupid this was, and how, oh, this is [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1195.28s)]
*  all these guys ever want to do is drop a bomb on someone rather than pick up the phone call and [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1202.0s)]
*  pursue diplomacy and this whole lecture. And man, like, we could use a guy like that to be president [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1206.56s)]
*  right now, because it just seems like so obvious. But, you know, it just seems to me. And I know [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1213.04s)]
*  that sometimes, you know, it's funny, because sometimes the speaking of Tim pool, like the Tim [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1221.28s)]
*  pools of the world will say there, you know, there's like, you know, there's the of the Trump [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1226.24s)]
*  kind of broad coalition, right? There's like the people who are like, total Zionists want to support [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1234.0s)]
*  Israel. There's the people who are, you know, huge critics of Israel. And then there's kind of the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1240.64s)]
*  people in the middle or whatever. And people like Tim pool will say like, Oh, why are you guys so [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1245.68s)]
*  obsessed with Israel? Like, why are you just always talking about the Israeli Palestinian conflict? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1252.0s)]
*  I mean, you know what, are you talking about what's going on in Sub-Saharan Africa right now or in [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1257.36s)]
*  Southeast Asia or where, you know, like, why do you care so much about this conflict? But it's like, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1262.64s)]
*  you know, aside from it just being like, something horrific is being done with my tax dollars. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1267.84s)]
*  It's really this. It's like, this is really what it's about. It's like now because we support [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1273.04s)]
*  Israel, we have to now be drawn into yet another war in the Middle East with an even larger war [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1278.64s)]
*  looming behind it, which it seems like there's this huge effort to get us into. Like, this is the [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1286.48s)]
*  this is the whole issue. It's not just like, it's not just like, Israel can do this to the Palestinians [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1292.0s)]
*  with American money and that's it. It's like, Oh, this also requires us constantly being at war with [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1298.4s)]
*  other Arab states or other Muslim states as a result of it. And this is what we're opposing here. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1305.28s)]
*  Hey guys, as I always say, if you want to change the world, start with your own behaviors. And [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1313.44s)]

*  believe in liberty just like you. They do all the roasting, packing and shipping in house. There's [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1331.04s)]
*  no middleman. There's a reason they have over 25,000 five star reviews because the coffee is [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1336.8799999999999s)]

*  Yeah. And when Biden was in, in 2023, when this all popped off the U S bases in Iraq and Syria came [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1379.44s)]
*  under like constant like rocket and drone attack because the U S was supporting what Israel's doing [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1386.24s)]
*  in Gaza. And it, and it culminated in three U S army soldiers being killed in a drone attack. So, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1391.52s)]
*  you know, this is very much the reason for why the U S keeps these bases in Iraq and Syria. I mean, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1397.52s)]
*  there's been all these reports recently about the Trump administration, you know, they're drawing [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1402.64s)]
*  down troops in Syria. Initial reports said they might pull out, but who was arguing against it? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1406.48s)]
*  It was Israel. Israel wants the U S to stay. Now they're now it's under the pretext of keeping [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1411.36s)]
*  Turkey out of certain areas, you know, after they got rid of Assad, Iran's ally. Now they're saying [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1416.56s)]
*  that the new government, you know, they're justifying invading southern Syria and occupying it and [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1422.56s)]
*  bombing it. So yeah, I mean, this is the key kind of everything, especially today, like again, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1427.84s)]
*  with Yemen, this is just so obvious. It's more in your face with this situation in Yemen. I remember [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1433.52s)]
*  there was a report from Ynet Israeli media because so after the U S started bombing Yemen on March [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1438.32s)]
*  15th, and they also preempted Israel breaking this completely breaking the ceasefire. It was March [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1443.84s)]
*  15th that the U S first launched the airstrikes on Yemen. And it was March 18th that Israel [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1449.2s)]
*  completely ended the ceasefire and killed like 400 and I think it was like 470 Palestinians in [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1455.6799999999998s)]
*  the first 24 hours, including like a lot of kids like nearly 200 children. And so you look at the [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1461.84s)]
*  timeline. And after that March 18th, when they started bombing Gaza again, then the Houthis started [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1470.3999999999999s)]
*  firing missiles at Israel again, kind of separate from them declaring a blockade. Now they're [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1476.56s)]
*  shooting missiles and drones at Israel. And there's a report in Ynet that said the U S told Israel, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1481.6s)]
*  don't worry about these attacks. You know, you guys don't need to respond. We'll take care of it [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1487.84s)]
*  because Israel did bomb Yemen, I believe, two or three times last year in response to these attacks. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1492.8s)]
*  But so it is just blatantly in your face about this bombing campaign in Yemen is about Israel. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1497.6799999999998s)]
*  Of course, there's other factors, including just the profit, the military industrial complex. That's [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1503.36s)]
*  always a factor. But this is very just so clearly about just ensuring Israel can continue to do [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1508.8799999999999s)]
*  whatever it wants. And it's really shameful. I mean, again, I mentioned the blockade, like Trump [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1516.08s)]
*  has the ability to get on the phone and say, let the aid into Gaza, or I'm going to cut you off. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1521.4399999999998s)]
*  And every day doesn't do that. I mean, it's just, it's just really shameful. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1526.24s)]
*  Yeah. And it seems like at least in, you know, when we'll see how that develops, but at least [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1530.72s)]
*  like in Ukraine, Trump is certainly willing to say like, Hey, look, if you want our support, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1536.24s)]
*  and you're relying on us, then okay, but we have some expectations, we have some boundaries and [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1541.92s)]
*  conditions that come along with that. And yet it just is almost never seems to be the case [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1546.96s)]
*  with the US relationship with Israel. And, you know, to your point, this is something I've kind [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1553.3600000000001s)]
*  of been hitting on a lot lately, but I find this to be an interesting dynamic. But like, okay, if [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1557.2s)]
*  you know, like what I know now, what you probably know better than I know, but like, if you know [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1563.68s)]
*  about the war in Iraq, and you really know, you know, like, okay, you can go read through like [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1569.76s)]
*  the project for a new American century, or you can read the clean break memo, or you can read [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1575.36s)]
*  Netanyahu's old writings or whatever. And you can see that like, okay, the Likudniks in Israel and [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1579.84s)]
*  the neo conservatives, their counterpart in the United States of America, they wanted to overthrow [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1585.04s)]
*  Saddam Hussein since at least the nineties. Okay. And they were very upset that they didn't [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1590.08s)]
*  overthrow him in the first Gulf War. And they wanted to have plans to overthrow him all [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1595.04s)]
*  throughout the nineties and well before 911. However, that was not first off, there weren't [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1600.1599999999999s)]
*  podcasts, and there wasn't social media. And there were, you know, whatever, there were newsletters [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1606.96s)]
*  and stuff like that. But this was not something that was widely known. It probably was widely [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1611.84s)]
*  known within connected people in DC, but it wasn't widely known by the American people. And the [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1617.04s)]
*  propaganda at least for going into Iraq was no, it had nothing to do with that. This has nothing [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1622.64s)]
*  to do with Israel. This was about 911. This was about nuclear weapons. And the fact that Saddam [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1627.2800000000002s)]
*  Hussein was in on 911, and now he has nukes. So he's friends with these terrorists, they could [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1632.24s)]
*  end up getting a nuke and nuking the United States of America. So there was at least, you know, there [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1636.5600000000002s)]
*  was some good old fashioned propaganda there, where Joe six pack in America could very reasonably [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1641.2s)]
*  seeing what was said on the TV say to his friend, well, we got to go see about these nuclear weapons. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1647.44s)]
*  I mean, we can't let that, you know, we can't let that go. But there just simply is no propaganda [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1651.52s)]
*  like this with the Houthis. Nobody is even attempting to make the argument that some, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1656.4s)]
*  aside from the fact that they could, could be a problem for some of our ships, where as I can't [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1662.6399999999999s)]
*  remember, was it JD Vance or Pete Hicks, or I think both of them acknowledged on the signal chat, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1667.92s)]
*  like a very small percentage of our trade even depends on any of this, but like, that's the best [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1672.4s)]
*  they got. They got it's just so obvious that this is about the conflict in Gaza, however you [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1677.84s)]
*  feel about it. That's what's going on here. And you do wonder, like, it again, it seems to me like, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1684.48s)]
*  I guess, two thoughts. Number one, it just seems like everything else. It seems so short sighted [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1691.84s)]
*  by even the pro Israel factions. And then, you know, just because I have, you know, been getting [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1698.56s)]
*  a lot of this heat thrown my way lately, it kind of seems like almost like a, I've gotten to the [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1705.2s)]
*  point in debating about Israel that nobody is even, nobody anymore is even saying like, oh, you got [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1712.56s)]
*  to go debate this guy or something like that. Like I was getting a lot of, Douglas Murray was the one [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1721.3600000000001s)]
*  who everyone always used to throw at me. They used to go, well, you should debate those, he'll [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1726.24s)]
*  destroy you on this. And now they're like, okay. People said Josh Hammer was going to be the [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1729.3600000000001s)]
*  destroyer. Dennis Prager was going to, but now it's no one's even trying to debate that anymore. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1735.12s)]
*  They're just basically saying that I am responsible for all of the Jew hatred online or something [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1739.28s)]
*  like that. And, but I just go for all these people who like Jew hatred on Twitter is their biggest [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1746.48s)]
*  concern. Like, well, what do you think? What do you think getting into another catastrophic war in [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1753.68s)]
*  the middle East on behalf of Israel is going to make this country look like? But what do you think [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1759.2s)]
*  the response to that is going to be? That almost to me seems like a call to their bluff. Like you [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1763.76s)]
*  must not actually be that concerned about this because otherwise this is the last thing you would [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1769.68s)]
*  want to do. Well, yeah, yeah. I mean, people, they don't seem to really want to engage with, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1774.16s)]
*  with that point. And this, when it comes to Yemen, cause again, it's, it's more in your face. Like [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1779.92s)]
*  it's just, this isn't even part of the discussion. I mean, when do people say, oh, debate me on [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1785.04s)]
*  whether or not we should be bombing Yemen or something like that. And of course, the talking [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1790.0s)]
*  point when it comes to Yemen is that they're, you know, the Houthis are backed by Iran. If you read [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1794.56s)]
*  any mainstream coverage of it, they call them the Iran backed Houthi rebels. They're the rebels, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1799.12s)]
*  even though they've controlled Sanaa now for over 10 years and an important point because people, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1803.92s)]
*  you could look at a map and you'll see the Houthi controlled areas in the, in the West and the rest [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1808.6399999999999s)]
*  is not controlled by them, but that's where 80% of Yemenis live. That's where most of the population [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1814.16s)]
*  lives. So it's an important point. And Yemen used to be North and South Yemen. It's basically [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1818.88s)]
*  North Yemen that they control the former country. But anyway, so the, the narrative is that they're [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1822.4s)]
*  Iran backed and they certainly receive support from Iran. What level we don't really know. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1827.6000000000001s)]
*  Essentially how I understand it is that Iran probably helped them develop their missile and [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1832.96s)]
*  drone program, giving them these like missile components and drone components. And, but they [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1837.0400000000002s)]
*  make them domestically. So it's not like they rely on Iran for weapon shipments. And this is [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1843.68s)]
*  something Trump has said, Oh, Iran has to cut them off or we're going to blame them for every attack. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1848.72s)]
*  And he actually said something recently, like a couple of weeks ago, just in a press conference, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1853.44s)]
*  he said, did you know who knew the Houthis make their own missiles and drones? You know, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1857.28s)]
*  could you believe that? It's like, yeah, I knew that a lot of people knew that before you started [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1860.8s)]
*  bombing them. But anyway, back to your point. So it is the narrative that it's like, you know, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1864.88s)]
*  uh, this is the axis, the anti-Israel axis. And I do think, you know, Hezbollah is basically neutered [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1870.5600000000002s)]
*  at this point. Assad is out of Syria. They do really see the Houthis as a major thorn in Israel's [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1877.44s)]
*  side, because they just keep getting better and better at being able to send missiles and drones, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1883.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, in these, these long range attacks. So, you know, that's, that's a big part of this is [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1887.6000000000001s)]
*  trying to take out another one of Israel's enemies in the region. And of course, the big one is Iran. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1892.88s)]
*  And I also think part of this bombing campaign is kind of as a threat to Iran, you know, because [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1898.72s)]
*  Trump's saying he's going to bomb Iran if they don't reach a deal. It's not an idle threat when [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1904.64s)]
*  you see him using two aircraft carriers and B-2 bombers stationed in Diego Garcia to bomb Yemen, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1908.5600000000002s)]
*  to, you know, really bomb the crap out of the country. I mean, over a thousand airstrikes. It's [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1914.5600000000002s)]
*  just, it's really insane. And yeah, I think the fact that the US is doing this for Israel could [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1919.92s)]
*  increase antisemitism more than you saying, Hey, maybe we shouldn't help kill babies in Gaza. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1926.08s)]
*  Even, even more than mentioning the name Paul Wolfowitz, you think? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1932.3999999999999s)]
*  You think this kid? That was too much. Yeah, I know. It really was. It was the moment. It was [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1936.08s)]
*  the moment. You know, one thing about this antisemitism stuff, like I think, you know, obviously, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1941.52s)]
*  if you go on X, you see this stuff, you see these kinds of anonymous accounts that Jordan [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1945.9199999999998s)]
*  Peterson was talking about on Joe Rogan, I guess. But I think not talking about this stuff and [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1950.96s)]
*  pretending like Israel doesn't have this influence over our foreign policy, yeah, like we'll add to [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1957.28s)]
*  that fuel that fire more, but having people that can honestly discuss these things and aren't [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1963.3600000000001s)]
*  antisemites, but can discuss, you know, realistically what's happening will lead less people down that [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1968.8s)]
*  path. So that whole talking point is just nonsense. Yeah, I, right. I completely agree. And there's [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1974.8s)]
*  something, you know, there's like, I mentioned this a lot on the show because it's, I don't know, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1980.32s)]
*  I think it's, it's important and it's important particularly to me, but like, so, you know, what [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1984.96s)]
*  pulled me into the libertarian world and set me on this trajectory to be whatever I am now, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1989.2s)]
*  was the Ron Paul Giuliani moment and that Ron Paul was just making this what I found to be at the time. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=1995.9199999999998s)]
*  And then since obsessively reading about this for many years, I've just been more and more [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2002.6399999999999s)]
*  convinced that the truth is that like, you know, there is a consequence to [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2008.08s)]
*  certain military actions and that leads to creating a lot of hatred in the world. And that, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2014.72s)]
*  you know, there's all these different kind of like, you know, different people have noted this, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2021.9199999999998s)]
*  of course, obviously, General McChrystal's insurgent math, 10 minus two equals 20, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2027.9199999999998s)]
*  you know, you keep killing people and there's a lot of innocent people who get killed in the [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2034.88s)]
*  president and more and more people join up to the resistance. But it is even as you're saying that, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2038.24s)]
*  you know, and of course, as Scott Horton points out and demonstrates in his, his book enough already, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2044.96s)]
*  you know, on September 11th, Ben Laden and all of his men were like a few hundred people. And then [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2051.52s)]
*  at the height of the global war on terror, it's like tens of thousands of bin Laden night Islamists [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2057.6s)]
*  who are fighting like it's just it's right in front of you that you're not eliminating them, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2064.0s)]
*  you're creating more of them. But as you say this, it's maybe even like the first time I'm [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2067.92s)]
*  thinking about it exactly in this way. But imagine you could zoom out, like go back 20 years. And, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2072.48s)]
*  and you were to say, or maybe 25 years to keep all of them in but like in terms of like Israel's [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2081.76s)]
*  enemies in the region, because again, this this really was anyone can go read the clean break [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2088.08s)]
*  memo like this was the strategy. Their strategy was like, listen, we're going to have a break from [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2092.8s)]
*  the peace process, we're going to have a break from this idea that we have to settle the Israel [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2097.36s)]
*  Palestine issue in order for Israel to make peace with the broader Arab and Muslim world. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2101.84s)]
*  And instead of settling that issue, we can just take out Israel's enemies in the broader [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2107.36s)]
*  Muslim and Arab world. And imagine you were to say to Israel, hey, you know, your big enemies. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2112.0s)]
*  All right, Saddam Hussein gone, Momar Gaddafi gone, Bashar al-Assad gone, Hezbollah's leadership, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2118.8799999999997s)]
*  totally annihilated, like all of that. And they go, ah, shoot. Now we got to go see about these [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2127.12s)]
*  Houthis. And you're like, oh, it's, it's just kind of proof. It's like, yeah, you can never [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2132.0s)]
*  whack a mole enough to get them all got, you just can't keep doing this to the Palestinians and think [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2136.56s)]
*  that there's not going to be resistance against that. And it's like in the same sense that like, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2143.28s)]
*  even just within the Israel Palestine conflict, like Israel's been dominating and occupying them [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2148.88s)]
*  for, for 60 years and they're still dealing with resistance. You can never put it out enough [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2154.1600000000003s)]
*  because people do not much like to be brutally oppressed. And there's going to be resistance [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2160.2400000000002s)]
*  to that. That just seems so obvious to me. Yeah. And when you talk about insurgent math [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2166.6400000000003s)]
*  and all that stuff, I mean, this applies, I think so much with Yemen with kind of who the Houthis are, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2172.88s)]
*  like what their identity is. For the background of them, you know, something Douglas Murray said [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2178.1600000000003s)]
*  in your debate was he was like, oh, Iran colonized, you know, these countries. He said that they [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2183.52s)]
*  colonized Yemen. And it's just such an absurd. It's funny for like a British guy to say that [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2188.32s)]
*  in the first place, but for like, to say that Iran colonized Yemen, I mean, again, it's just, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2193.84s)]
*  it shows he has just no understanding of the situation in Yemen, who the Houthis are. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2200.0s)]
*  They're a specific sect of Shiite Islam. They're Zaydi Shiites. And the area of North Yemen, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2204.7200000000003s)]
*  like they're kind of strongholds Sadda and most of the area that they control now was ruled by [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2211.68s)]
*  Zaydi Shia imams for a thousand years until the 1960s. And the Houthis, they started, I believe [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2216.32s)]
*  they were called the believing youth. They started as like a religious movement, kind of as a push [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2224.2400000000002s)]
*  back to the Sunni Wahhabism that the Saudis were pushing in Yemen. So they started as a religious [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2228.16s)]
*  movement, but they have very deep roots in the country. And yeah, they're allied with Iran [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2236.16s)]
*  politically because they ended up being on the same side of certain things. But this idea that [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2241.8399999999997s)]
*  Iran, you know, because people, again, if you read the media every day and you see Iran back, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2248.16s)]
*  Iran back, Iran's proxy, the Iranian proxy, you would think that Iran like plucked some Shiites [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2252.24s)]
*  out of its own country and dropped them in Yemen, but it's just not true. And again, their whole [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2257.68s)]
*  identity is part of this resistance against Israel, against US imperialism, against the Gulf monarchs. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2263.04s)]
*  And you do what the US is doing now, bomb residential buildings full of civilians to kill a guy, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2271.9199999999996s)]
*  one guy. And then you think that's not going to, you know, you talk about the insurgent math. I [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2278.3999999999996s)]
*  mean, this is just really building up their support. And my hope is that the reality is, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2283.36s)]
*  because we see this talk about the US backing a ground campaign, but what I'm also hearing is that [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2289.52s)]
*  the other factions in Yemen, some of them have rallied behind the Houthis now in response to them [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  being the ones, you know, really the only ones sticking up for the Palestinians at this point. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2300.96s)]
*  So it's like, it really just kind of building up their whole, like just their whole thing, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2304.88s)]
*  their whole identity, their whole narrative. And if you're a Yemeni, just a regular guy in Yemen, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2310.4s)]
*  living in these conditions, I mean, you just got to put yourself in their shoes. We see what's [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2315.6800000000003s)]
*  happening in Gaza every day. Oh, well, that's why we're being bombed now by the Americans, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2320.4s)]
*  because we're standing up for all those dead, you know, those dead children you see on the news [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2323.92s)]
*  every single day. We're the only ones, you know, standing up for that. And that's why the Americans, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2327.84s)]
*  you know, the evil empire is bombing us. I mean, this just few, it's just fertile ground for more [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2332.32s)]
*  recruitment for the Houthis, like to kind of a ridiculous degree. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2336.88s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's exactly right. And it is the, I know, like, you know, certainly I do know that, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2341.6800000000003s)]
*  right, like Iran was arming Hezbollah for a while. I think there's a part of the, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2349.6800000000003s)]
*  major part of the reason why they wanted Bashar al-Assad gone. But it is interesting. First of all, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2356.32s)]
*  like any time Hamas, Hezbollah or the Houthis, any of the H's get written about, it's always Iran [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2361.28s)]
*  backed. And yet this logic never seems to apply. Like, it's not like if Jordan ever does anything, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2370.6400000000003s)]
*  they must be referred to as the US backed Jordanians do this or the US backed Egyptians or the US backed [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2379.1200000000003s)]
*  Saudis or the US backed Israelis or the, you know what I'm saying? Like it's just, they never like [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2386.96s)]
*  apply this standard across the board. By the way, I mean, again, you know, a point I love to make, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2392.0s)]
*  but you could also call Hamas the Israeli backed Hamas militants launched October 7th, you know, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2397.68s)]
*  like if you were to say it like that, it would, first of all, it would actually be much more [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2403.68s)]
*  accurate and, and, and much more damning and eye opening to the whole situation. But it is an [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2407.68s)]
*  interesting tactic that they use that you're never, you know, it's, it's funny because if I, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2414.56s)]
*  let's say I were to argue with someone like maybe on Joe Rogan with someone with a posh British [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2420.7999999999997s)]
*  accent, I were to say that like, Hey, you know, the national endowment for democracy in the USA ID [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2425.36s)]
*  poured a hundred million dollars into the made on revolution. Well that now I'm denying agency, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2430.7999999999997s)]
*  like you're denying agency. If you bring that up and yet referring to every militant group in the [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2437.2s)]
*  region as an Iranian proxy is somehow not denying agency. And so like, like you're putting like, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2443.28s)]
*  not even saying that Iran hasn't been political allies with some of these people, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2449.76s)]
*  but they are their own groups with their own motivations as well. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2453.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And as I understand, you know, Iran has a lot of sway over Hezbollah, you know, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2458.5600000000004s)]
*  they're very closely aligned with them over the Shiite factions in Iraq that the US helped put [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2463.2000000000003s)]
*  in power. And, but when it comes to Yemen, I mean, the Houthis are like known as being much more [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2468.0s)]
*  their own thing. So yeah, it's just, and I've seen people say the opposite, but it's just not true. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2473.52s)]
*  Like, so, but whenever we see, you know, what little mainstream coverage there is of the situation, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2479.76s)]
*  it's like, Oh, US airstrike in Yemen killed 65 migrants, the Iran backed Houthis say, like, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2485.04s)]
*  they just kind of acting like everything's not really a big deal. What's happened? It's like, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2492.0s)]
*  Oh, it's just the Iran backed Houthis that, that were bombing, you know, don't worry about [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2495.68s)]
*  all these civilians. So yeah, it's just, and you talk about the consequences of blowback and [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2500.24s)]
*  everything for what's happening now. It just, it's just, there's such a better way to approach the [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2507.2799999999997s)]
*  whole region at this point. And I don't even think like, Trump wouldn't be like, I think if Trump [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2515.2799999999997s)]
*  really wanted to bring peace, he has the ability. I mean, again, it's all Gaza is the key. But it [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2519.28s)]
*  just doesn't seem like he wants to do that. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2526.96s)]
*  sponsor for today's show, which is my patriot supply. Let me ask you something. If the grocery [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2531.1200000000003s)]
*  store shelves went empty tomorrow, would your family be ready? Personally, I trust my patriot [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2537.0400000000004s)]
*  supply with my family's food security. And here's why they've helped millions of Americans prepare [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2544.1600000000003s)]
*  for the worst. And they have over 70,000 five star reviews. Personally, I keep their three month [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2549.2s)]
*  emergency food kits on hand. And right now you can get the same ones I use for $200 off. That's a [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2555.3599999999997s)]
*  huge discount. And believe me, my patriot supply almost never offers deals like this. The food [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2562.48s)]
*  kits give you 2000 calories a day per person for three months. The food tastes great, lasts up to [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2568.3999999999996s)]
*  25 years. It ships free with delivery in as little as two days. So take advantage of this [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2574.8s)]
*  deal and go to prepare with Smith calm. This $200 off discount is only for a limited time. So don't [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2580.2400000000002s)]
*  wait, go to prepare with Smith calm right now. That's prepare with Smith calm. Get peace of mind [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2587.44s)]
*  while it's still available. All right, let's get back into the show. Do you what do you make of [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2594.0800000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump, who appears to have at least temporarily thwarted the Israeli plans to launch [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2600.08s)]
*  attacks on Israel, excuse me, on Iran. And now, over the last couple weeks, Netanyahu has been [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2607.2000000000003s)]
*  saying they're about to do it anyway, but it does seem like the plans that they had laid out [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2615.1200000000003s)]
*  involve the US helping them because of course, they can't actually do any of this stuff without [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2621.6800000000003s)]
*  our help. Do you think I mean, like this does seems to me like a small temporary when at least [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2626.4s)]
*  given a bad situation, but do you think he's like, like you said, I mean, he could be pushing for [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2633.36s)]
*  peace in this region, and he doesn't seem to be using any of the leverage he has, which is [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2638.8s)]
*  substantial. What do you make of that? Where do you see this all going? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2643.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that he's even just saying like, oh, if we don't reach a deal, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2648.2400000000002s)]
*  we're gonna bomb them is not, you know, that's not good. You don't need to approach these [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2652.24s)]
*  negotiations like that. And I mean, when he was asked about this report recently, and somebody [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2656.7999999999997s)]
*  said, it was in his time interview, they said, Oh, do you think Netanyahu is going to drag you into [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2661.2s)]
*  war? And he said, I, he said, I'd go willingly, basically, he said, I could go into it willingly. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2664.9599999999996s)]
*  And that if we do attack Iran, we'll be leading the pack. So he's, you know, really making these [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2671.68s)]
*  threats. And a lot of people kind of point to his first term, like the threats against North Korea. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2676.16s)]
*  But again, we're talking about a situation where in the same region, the US has all this firepower [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2680.16s)]
*  that's bombing another country and a big part of the buildup sending the bomber sending the [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2685.04s)]
*  aircraft carriers and also sending air defenses to it actually to Israel to prepare for this [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2689.04s)]
*  potential war with Iran, like the US has the military posture to do it. So I mean, the fact [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2694.3999999999996s)]
*  that he chose not to bomb Iran, I mean, I don't, it's hard for me to give him credit for that, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2700.8799999999997s)]
*  because like, it shouldn't even be a possibility in the first place. But it's just concerning, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2706.0s)]
*  you know, it does seem like he wants a deal. He does keep saying that and while he makes these [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2712.88s)]
*  threats. And it looks like the negotiations are advancing. I mean, they've had three rounds and [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2716.8s)]
*  they both sides say they're going well. On the other hand, you have the Trump administration [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2722.32s)]
*  officials like Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz saying publicly that any deal must dismantle Iran's [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2728.24s)]
*  nuclear enrichment program altogether, which that's just not even that's just a non starter [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2733.84s)]
*  for Iran. But it looks like that's not the demand that they're making behind the scenes. So I mean, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2738.48s)]
*  it's tough to say where this is going to go. There was recently over the weekend, a huge port [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2742.96s)]
*  explosion in Iran that I believe killed 60 people. And with things like that, I mean, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2747.6000000000004s)]
*  the Iranians haven't made the accusation that it was an attack or sabotage. But Israel has a [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2753.84s)]
*  history of sabotage attacks inside Iran and of doing them to sabotage diplomacy between the US [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2759.68s)]
*  and Iran. They did it. They detonated an explosive and an Iranian nuclear facility in April 2021, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2764.96s)]
*  when Biden started negotiations with Iran. But again, so far, no Israeli sources have taken [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2770.96s)]
*  credit for that or in the Iranians. There's like an Iranian member of parliament who accused the [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2776.3199999999997s)]
*  Israelis of being behind it. But the fact is, we don't really know at this point. But something [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2781.44s)]
*  like that, like a sabotage attack, you know, we might see things like that, that Netanyahu might [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2785.68s)]
*  do to try to sabotage the diplomacy, because I think he sees this as the time this Trump [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2790.96s)]
*  administration is his chance, possibly his last chance to get that war with Iran, that he's always [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2796.56s)]
*  wanted. And then, you know, imagine if the US and Iran are engaged in a war, he could just do [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2803.52s)]
*  whatever he wants to the Palestinians in Gaza, there's not going to be nearly as much attention [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2807.68s)]
*  on it, they could advance their designs in the West Bank more freely. So yeah, it's, you know, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2812.16s)]
*  that he has a lot of motive to make this war happen in Yahoo. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2820.0s)]
*  Do you think the way I've always felt about this, as I've been paying attention to it over the last, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2825.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, couple decades, is that it seems to me that the Iranians, you know, much like, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2831.52s)]
*  I think this is kind of the way it always works with governments in general, but governments [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2840.08s)]
*  are, they kind of have to at least pose as your protectors in order to preserve any perceived [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2847.2s)]
*  legitimacy amongst their people. And so the Iranians, like, for example, when they responded to the [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2856.72s)]
*  Israeli attacks back last year, and they sent those rockets, or they sent those missiles at Israel, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2864.64s)]
*  but they gave the US warning, and they didn't really send everything they had, they essentially, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2870.72s)]
*  it seems like, similarly to after Donald Trump killed Soleimani, and they kind of sent like [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2875.2s)]
*  some rockets at US bases, but didn't kill anybody, like they want to, you know, they basically want [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2881.36s)]
*  to act as if they've responded to kind of save face with their own people. But then at the same [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2887.44s)]
*  time, they don't really want this fight because they know, I mean, you know, if you could picture [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2894.16s)]
*  where Iran is, like, if you could picture a map of them, like their neighbors are Iraq and Afghanistan, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2898.3999999999996s)]
*  they've seen what the US military has done to their two neighbors while threatening to do it to [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2905.12s)]
*  them for these entire 20 years. And it does almost seem like they're, you know, they're, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2909.68s)]
*  they don't actually want this fight, they want to, you know, posture as if they're not pushovers, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2916.48s)]
*  and that they will respond. I think what a lot of the, you know, it's like, like, I almost think [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2922.56s)]
*  about, you know, like an analogy would be that, like, you know, it's, imagine you're like walking [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2928.64s)]
*  with your wife and your two kids down the street or something like that. I think we both got the [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2933.2s)]
*  same amount of kids. They were walking with your two kids and your wife, and you're surrounded by [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2938.48s)]
*  much tougher guys. And they're like talking shit and they're disrespecting you. And you're almost [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2942.56s)]
*  like, all right, okay, just take it. Let's keep walking. Like, I don't want anything to happen to [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2947.04s)]
*  my family here. But like at a certain point, if they, if they cross the line, you're going to be [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2950.96s)]
*  like, well, I guess I got to fight these guys and land as many punches as I can. I'm probably going [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2955.12s)]
*  to lose, but I have to do something here. And it does seem like the Trump administration and the [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2959.36s)]
*  Warhawks are presenting this as if it is an option to just take out the Iranian nuclear sites, like [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2965.76s)]
*  to just have a massive bombing campaign in Iran. And then that's it. We don't have to do like a [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2974.88s)]
*  full invasion like we did in Iraq. We could just do that and then go back to life as normal. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2979.68s)]
*  My guess would be there is no way that Iran could allow that to happen without some type of [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2985.6s)]
*  response. And they have a lot of responses available to them. But what do you think about [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2992.7999999999997s)]
*  that? Like, do you think, is it possible for the Israelis and the American military to just take [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=2997.52s)]
*  out the Iranian nuclear program? And that's that? I do not think so. But that is the talking [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3002.3999999999996s)]
*  point we hear. I remember Tom Cotton said that recently in a hearing. And you see people who [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3009.52s)]
*  support this idea of bombing Iran, acting like it'll be no big deal. But I think it's very clear, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3014.72s)]
*  if they take that step, because what it would take to try to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3020.32s)]
*  would be dropping the US's heaviest bunker busting bombs, they're like 30,000 pounds, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3026.56s)]
*  because they built these facilities deep underground in anticipation of something like [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3032.48s)]
*  this happening. So if the US goes out and drops those bombs on that, I mean, they're going to [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3038.08s)]
*  respond. And the fact is, is that they have advanced ballistic missiles that can hit, I believe, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3043.44s)]
*  about 10 US bases in the region, probably more. And as you know, this is something Tucker's been [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3049.2s)]
*  talking about a lot lately, the Pentagon assessments are like hundreds or thousands of [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3055.12s)]
*  American casualties. And then what happens is Trump just going to be like, Oh, well, that's that? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3059.44s)]
*  No, then it's going to become an even bigger war. I don't really see a situation where the US like [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3064.16s)]
*  tries to invade Iran. I mean, it's just not realistic. Like, nobody has the will, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3069.36s)]
*  none of the people in the US have the will, the US military doesn't have the will, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3074.64s)]
*  where are they going to invade from? But I could see just like really heavy bombing, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3078.08s)]
*  maybe some ground fighting in like Iraq or something. Until somebody says, All right, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3082.0s)]
*  enough. I guess we just got to negotiate here or something. But like, yeah, it's just there's no [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3088.0s)]
*  way that the US just takes out the nuclear facilities. And that's it. The other thing is [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3093.92s)]
*  that Iran does not have a nuclear weapons program. That's what US intelligence has said, that's been [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3098.24s)]
*  the consensus since the early 2000s. But they use their nuclear program essentially as leverage, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3102.72s)]
*  and they kind of use the threat of it turning into weaponization as leverage. And the conversation [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3108.8s)]
*  has changed inside Iran, you're seeing more calls for the Ayatollah to reverse his ban on making nukes. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3116.08s)]
*  And an advisor to the Ayatollah said that if you know, the US and Israel attack, then we could change [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3121.6s)]
*  our position on nuclear weapons. You know, they want there to be consequences for bombing them. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3126.56s)]
*  And that New York Times report was interesting. It said that the plans to attack Iran could set [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3132.0s)]
*  back their nuclear program by a year. So suggesting that, oh, they actually can't completely destroy it, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3138.16s)]
*  which makes sense. So yeah, it would be like bombing a country under a phony pretext of [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3145.2799999999997s)]
*  them having a nuclear weapons program, and it could actually create one. So the whole thing, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3152.88s)]
*  like for every reason, it's just would be a very foolish thing to do. And there's just no reason [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3159.2s)]
*  to be this hostile against Iran right now, except for Israel. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3164.88s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's right. And you know, it's, it reminds me even right, like, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3169.52s)]
*  Douglas Murray said to me when I pointed out that the war in Afghanistan was not just about [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3174.64s)]
*  taking out Al Qaeda, but that we launched a 20 year regime change war against the Taliban. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3180.0s)]
*  And he goes, well, you got dragged into the quick sound of war. And it's like, right. Yeah, that's [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3185.2799999999997s)]
*  right. That sure can happen. Not like if you, if you look at the, the original, you know, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3190.48s)]
*  authorization of use of military force against Iraq, it was very narrow to take out Saddam [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3197.2s)]
*  Hussein. And we took out Saddam Hussein very quickly, but then we were there for another [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3202.64s)]
*  two decades. And I still have some military forces there today. Even at the beginning of [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3206.96s)]
*  the Ukraine war, Joe Biden was very clear that the Ukraine can win with sanctions, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3212.48s)]
*  that we could support them just with sanctions. That was supposed to be the extent of American [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3219.6s)]
*  involvement. And you just see this all over the place. So the idea that right, like we're going to, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3224.48s)]
*  that we're going to just bomb the crap out of Iran, but that'll be it, man. You want to talk [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3231.6s)]
*  about risky games. That is a risky one. And as you said, it just seems like it would, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3236.8s)]
*  you know, it would be a situation where they would have to really respond. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3243.2s)]
*  And if they really responded, then how the hell are we not going to really respond to that? I mean, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3248.16s)]
*  again, just try to even imagine, you know, there was, after Trump killed Soleimani, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3253.3599999999997s)]
*  there was some restraint showed on both sides of that. And look, you could say [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3262.16s)]
*  killing Soleimani was probably one of the worst things Donald Trump ever did just in terms of how [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3268.16s)]
*  risky a move it was. But then you could also say that one of the best things he ever did was just [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3273.3599999999997s)]
*  leave it at that and not respond any further. But if you could just like run a counterfactual [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3278.32s)]
*  in your head and imagine that like the Iranian retaliatory strike had killed 10 US servicemen, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3284.1600000000003s)]
*  is it possible that Donald Trump would have, I certainly don't think so. I don't think there's [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3292.0800000000004s)]
*  any world in which Mr. Tough Guy, Donald Trump, with all of his Maryam Adelson money and all of [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3297.36s)]
*  the neocon hawks that he has around him, it would possibly be able to say, you're going to just let [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3302.8s)]
*  them kill 10 US soldiers and not have a bigger response to that. And so this is, you know, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3308.08s)]
*  the quick sound of war, as even neocon Douglas Murray would call it, that you just see it right [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3314.64s)]
*  in front of you. And, and again, for what benefit are we even playing with this game so that the [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3320.3199999999997s)]
*  country of Iran that poses no threat to any of us might continue to pose no threat to any of us? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3327.52s)]
*  It's just it's madness. Yeah. And fortunately, it seems like the lesson Trump got out of the [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3334.4s)]
*  Soleimani thing was that he could hit Iran hard and not really suffer any consequences. That seems [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3341.36s)]
*  to be, and you see this kind of talking point from him and like his supporters like, oh, you know, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3346.96s)]
*  Ron didn't do anything after that, after we killed Soleimani. Well, they killed Soleimani under the [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3351.92s)]
*  pretext that he was helping plot attacks on US bases in the region. A US soldier was killed a [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3356.88s)]
*  few weeks earlier in Kirkuk, Iraq, and we don't really know who launched that rocket. And then in [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3362.4s)]
*  March of that year, more American, I believe two, one or two, or maybe some British soldiers, I [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3368.1600000000003s)]
*  forget exactly the number, but at least one American was killed, like just a couple months [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3372.88s)]
*  later. So the whole talking point is, oh, Ron didn't, you know, nothing happened after we killed [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3377.04s)]
*  Soleimani, it kind of solved all the problems, but it's just not the case. So but that is, you [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3380.56s)]
*  know, you hear Trump whenever, you know, you know, how he always says, oh, this would have never [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3385.84s)]
*  happened if it was me, Iran was broke. He touts his first, you know, administration's Iran policy, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3388.96s)]
*  even though it was a complete failure as like this great thing that like brought peace, which is just [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3395.76s)]
*  not, not the case. So unfortunately, it seems like that's, that's his thinking. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3400.7200000000003s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Sheath [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3405.52s)]

*  pouch, which is highly recommended. I was a little skeptical about the dual pouch at first, but can't [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3424.4s)]
*  live without it now. I've been wearing Sheath Underwear exclusively. They're the only underwear [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3429.44s)]

*  into the show. So do you, I mean, if you had to, you cover this stuff, you know, for a living and, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3458.3999999999996s)]
*  and in much more detail than I do, what, if you had to guess, where do you think, where do you [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3465.7599999999998s)]
*  think happens from here? Man, it's tough. You know, I think one big risk here, when we talk [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3470.96s)]
*  about American casualties is the Houthis, they're full of surprises. I wouldn't be surprised if we [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3478.2400000000002s)]
*  see one of their drones or missiles hit a U.S. warship, or maybe they'll try to target a base [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3484.48s)]
*  across the Red Sea in Djibouti or something. Or who knows? I mean, you just never know what they [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3490.7200000000003s)]
*  might be able to hit. There's a risk there. And then of the U.S. really escalating in Yemen [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3496.64s)]
*  and trying to back a ground invasion. And but what, you know, obviously, the big thing is Iran. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3501.68s)]
*  And a few weeks ago, I was much more pessimistic. I thought it was like inevitable, you know, when [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3508.72s)]
*  he started bombing Yemen and was making all these threats, and Israel just unleashing in Gaza again, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3513.84s)]
*  it's just like, oh, wow, this is, we're actually just going to go into war with Iran, aren't we? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3519.6s)]
*  But since the negotiations started, and the fact that they seem to be, you know, there's progress [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3524.2400000000002s)]
*  happening, they've even had some direct engagement. And it looks like obviously, Iran doesn't want a [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3530.5600000000004s)]
*  war with the U.S. And I think they're making that very clear to Trump. So that I think the risk is [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3535.92s)]
*  a little lower. But it's so hard for me to imagine them signing a deal with Iran. It's like that was [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3542.0800000000004s)]
*  like the Iran that was like the JCPOA that Obama negotiated, because like every Republican is [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3546.8s)]
*  is going to be against it, even, you know, it's just hard for me to imagine like an Iran nuclear [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3552.48s)]
*  deal happening right now. And that is the thing it seems like will is the only thing that will [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3557.44s)]
*  prevent war. So I think the chances are still pretty high of this turning into the US and Iran [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3562.32s)]
*  launching some strikes. Sorry, the US and Israel launching strikes on Iran, I think there's a good [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3568.8s)]
*  chance of that still happening here. And then, who knows where things escalate from there. But it's [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3574.4s)]
*  just, you know, I just don't see, you know, I follow the stuff in Gaza every day, the negotiations, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3580.88s)]
*  it's like, you saw Trump the other day saying, oh, he told claiming that he told Netanyahu, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3585.6800000000003s)]
*  he's got to be good to the people in Gaza. And, you know, we're taking care of the aid situation, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3590.2400000000002s)]
*  but there's no aid, there's no food going in there. And they're just killing dozens of people every [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3594.48s)]
*  day. So it just doesn't seem like he's willing to put any pressure on Israel to stop that right [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3598.8s)]
*  now, even though the you know, the American the Israeli hostage with American citizenship, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3603.28s)]
*  as apparently, according to Hamas has gone missing, after an Israeli airstrike, I mean, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3607.52s)]
*  you think that would be enough if that was his priority to get him to stop this, but it just [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3612.48s)]
*  goes on. It just goes on and on. And everybody's focused kind of more on the domestics up here in [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3617.84s)]
*  the US. I mean, for good reason, there's a lot of stuff happening. But it's just, you know, one [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3622.0s)]
*  thing really kind of showed how the media views all this stuff. After the signal gate thing, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3626.96s)]
*  Trump was in the Oval Office talking to reporters, and they were like grilling him about [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3633.76s)]
*  them having this conversation and signal and including the Atlantic reporter. And he was [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3638.1600000000003s)]
*  trying to deflect and the way he was trying to do it. He's like, I don't get why nobody asked me [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3643.1200000000003s)]
*  about the the airstrikes against the Houthis. They're going great. We're launching all these [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3646.4s)]
*  were bombing on me. But and like, nobody's saying, well, actually, they're not going great. Like, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3651.0400000000004s)]
*  nobody challenged him on that. They just kept asking about the things. So it's like, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3655.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, and this is the issue. I mean, even with all this going on with Iran, it's like [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3659.6800000000003s)]
*  a lot of Americans don't just don't really follow it. And that if this does lead to [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3663.2s)]
*  the US and Israel bombing Iran, Iran hitting back with missiles killing Americans, then, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3668.24s)]
*  then that's it. You know, we're at war with Iran. And, you know, however, that will play out. So [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3672.3999999999996s)]
*  there's just a real risk of this unless something really changes. Yeah, yeah. And man, it's, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3678.7999999999997s)]
*  it probably can't be overstated how as disastrous as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya and [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3687.2799999999997s)]
*  Syria and Somalia and Yemen, as bad as they were, Iran is biting off a lot more than any of those, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3693.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, by far. And they're much more formidable. And that's not to say that there are more powerful [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3700.24s)]
*  military than the United States of America, but like neither was the Taliban. And they're there. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3705.2799999999997s)]
*  They outlasted us in that war. So yeah, it's a it's dangerous times. I tend to agree with your [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3710.72s)]
*  assessment. I would love to think that these negotiations could lead to a deal. But just [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3717.04s)]
*  looking at the people just around Donald Trump, I mean, it just seems like every one of them is [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STw65ZVeS8&t=3721.2799999999997s)]
