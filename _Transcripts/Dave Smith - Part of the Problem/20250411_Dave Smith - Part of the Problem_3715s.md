# Dave Smith | Thoughts on the JRE Debate | Part Of The Problem 1251
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k)
*  What's up, what's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=0.0s)]
*  Kind of a special episode, a late night episode. Of course, I'm Dave Smith and he is Robbie [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  the fire Bernstein. How are you, sir? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=17.88s)]
*  I'm doing well. I'm so close to being done with having to take Adderall and put together [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  these poor store dates. And I'm very excited to be done with it. Mobile Alabama and Pensacola [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=24.68s)]
*  Florida is the start of the tour and you can find that at porch tour.com. Nice. Awesome. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=29.88s)]
*  Make sure you guys, if you're in the area where porch tour comes, go out and see one [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=34.72s)]
*  of the shows. This has become legendary at this point. People tell me I hear led all [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=37.68s)]
*  the time I'm on the road. Oh, I went to the porch tour. It was crazy. He brought me in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  the middle of the woods and did a ceremony of some sorts. And then it's not the best [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=45.44s)]
*  show of my life. And then I passed out and woke up, you know, blood coming out of my [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=48.84s)]
*  ass. I don't know how many more, I don't know how many more purchase I've left in me. I [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=54.16s)]
*  don't know that I got another year of taking Adderall and coordinating dates. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=58.16s)]
*  So this might be the last one. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=61.0s)]
*  Anyway, so I just I just got home today, spent the day with the family. It was very nice. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=64.88s)]
*  I've been on a crazy stretch of just traveling nonstop. And of course, it the last [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=70.52s)]
*  thing that I did was that well, I was out, you know, we were in Boston. Then I went down [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=78.52s)]
*  to Austin, did a solo episode with Rogan. Then I went and did the Nashville Comedy [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=82.28s)]
*  Festival, hung out with Kid Rock. Did you get a word in guy? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=87.36s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=91.04s)]
*  Arabs, dude, he couldn't have been cooler. Awesome guy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=91.84s)]
*  And no, we didn't talk to Arabs. I was just trying to angle for, you know, you try you [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=96.56s)]
*  don't you talk to Kid Rock to get a meeting with Donald Trump. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  What makes you even think you should have an opinion? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=104.52s)]
*  Well, OK, so then let's get to it. Then the thing that I did well just came out today [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=108.88s)]
*  and we did it yesterday. So I figured we'd do an episode kind of giving my thoughts on [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=113.4s)]
*  this debate. It's I'm exhausted. I've been doing a lot of traveling and I've, you know, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=118.4s)]
*  been been getting not so much sleep. So this might be a little bit of a shorter one. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=122.76s)]
*  But I did think maybe we would just, you know, talk about it a little bit. I could give my [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=127.2s)]
*  thoughts, my recap of it. And you I know you watched it. So you could give me your [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=131.52s)]
*  thoughts on it as well. It was my last my opinion. I mean, I watched it and I have [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=135.52s)]
*  thoughts, but where do I get credentialed? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=140.68s)]
*  But were you there though? Were you live? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=143.52s)]
*  I've never set foot in the Rogan studio, so I guess I haven't. Yeah, unless your feet [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=145.68s)]
*  touch the ground, you don't really absorb the information. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=150.4s)]
*  Yeah, you shouldn't really talk about it. I'm not arguing that you shouldn't talk about [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=153.12s)]
*  it. That's not my point. My point isn't that you shouldn't talk about it, but you [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  shouldn't talk about it. And probably there should be experts who talk about it. And [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  that's not OK. Anyway, you know, I kind of I my assumption is that I think that you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=163.4s)]
*  know, I kind of I my assumption is I know it's sometimes it almost seems a little, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=169.04s)]
*  you know, douchey to do these recap episodes, but I don't know. It's just I think [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=173.16s)]
*  this is probably going to end up being the biggest thing that I've ever done. I just [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=178.8s)]
*  have the feeling that this debate, I think me and Douglas debating would have been a [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=182.28s)]
*  big numbers show anywhere. But then you put that on Rogan and it's like, holy shit, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=186.12s)]
*  this is going to be a big, you know, a big episode. And people love debates like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=190.32s)]
*  that. So it was, you know, going into it, it was like, OK, this is going to be a big [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=194.52s)]
*  thing. This is I was very much looking forward to it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm a bit I was fairly confident about how it would go. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm happy with how it went. It's I think it's great. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=209.36s)]
*  I'm a bit shocked at how crazy it was. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=213.52s)]
*  And in the way I'll say this, right, this is an interesting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=215.96s)]
*  I think. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=218.88s)]
*  Being Douglas, both whatever side you're on, one of the really interesting [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=221.88s)]
*  dynamics, I thought of the debate that stuck out to me was that and I think even [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=225.6s)]
*  if you're like a Douglas Murray fan and you think, oh, he smoked me or whatever, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=230.4s)]
*  which most people seem to not think is the case. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=235.12s)]
*  But some of his say, you know, he's got a lot of big fan base and I have a big fan [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=237.88s)]
*  base. And so in those debates, there's always some people who are just firm on one [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=242.28s)]
*  side. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=245.76s)]
*  The interesting thing that we could all acknowledge is that me and him debating [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  would have been way more vicious on both ends on any other platform. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=251.56s)]
*  It was only because it was on Rogan that we're both. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=256.4s)]
*  So the whole time, both of us like want to be going more vicious than we are, but [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=259.36s)]
*  we're both kind of holding back, which just made for like a strange and kind of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=264.12s)]
*  funny dynamic to the debate. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=268.36s)]
*  You know, I know that what Rogan wanted was to have like a civil exchange of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=271.24s)]
*  ideas and not have it turned into like a vicious food fight. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=276.24s)]
*  And so I was like, not going to disrespect that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=280.2s)]
*  And then I understand why on that platform it, it should be a little bit different [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=282.64s)]
*  than it is on Pierce Morgan or something like this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=286.68s)]
*  This is for long form conversations. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=288.8s)]
*  So I go into it with that attitude. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=291.6s)]
*  And I also think that's kind of why I didn't, you know, there were areas I [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=294.08s)]
*  probably could have gone a little bit harder on him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=297.88s)]
*  But I also look, I'll say this and then I'll shut up and let you know, I'm [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=300.04s)]
*  going to let you talk for a little bit and you can tell me what you think. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=306.24s)]
*  But I really, I left there with the feeling, I would say even a half hour in to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=308.64s)]
*  the show. I just, I think the reaction that we're getting, you know, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=315.08s)]
*  I've had a lot of debates where the reaction is overwhelmingly that I won the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=321.32s)]
*  debate in this particular case. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=324.44s)]
*  It's just that he lost it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=327.76s)]
*  Like it wasn't even that I beat him in the debate. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=330.16s)]
*  He started out with a 40 minute struggle session for Joe Rogan that just contained [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=332.6s)]
*  probably the longest stretched logical fallacy I've ever seen anyone open a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=342.36s)]
*  debate with just a naked appeal to authority, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=347.76s)]
*  completely unclear with what he was saying. He literally, he came in. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=351.24s)]
*  So in this struggle session with Joe Rogan, I could make this up. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=355.36s)]
*  This is barely before I presented any thought or argument or opinion. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=358.36s)]
*  I think, I think it was before that he comes in with this long stretch that is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  an appeal to authority and appeal to expertise. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=367.36s)]
*  You're having these non experts talk about issues that experts should talk about [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=371.0s)]
*  and I'm not saying they should be censored and I'm not saying they shouldn't [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=375.04s)]
*  talk about it, but they're talking about it and they're acting like they're [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  experts. How are they acting like they're experts? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=380.2s)]
*  Because they're talking about it. And when they're talking, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=381.88s)]
*  I mean it was just the most ridiculous argument, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=383.92s)]
*  the most pompous elitist, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=387.92s)]
*  but essentially telling the host of the show and the entire audience, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=390.12s)]
*  your opinion doesn't matter. Like it was just a strategy to me that was like, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  do you want to make everyone think you're a pompous asshole? It was wild. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  In there sandwiched in this appeal to expertise, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=402.96s)]
*  he trashes Darrell Cooper and Ian Carroll whose names he doesn't even know and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=407.68s)]
*  admits that he's never consumed any of their material before yet. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=413.32s)]
*  He's trashing them and then claiming that you can only talk about these issues [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=417.44s)]
*  if you have expertise. Then when he's asked, does he have expertise? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=421.08s)]
*  He goes, well, in some things, do you talk about things you don't have [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=424.12s)]
*  expertise in? Yeah. All the time I talk about things I don't have expertise in. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay. Well, why can you do that? You're not even understanding my point. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=429.12s)]
*  You know, it was just like the most wild thing and it just became clear [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=433.24s)]
*  as the show went on that Douglas Murray came to do anything, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=438.68s)]
*  but debate me. Like that was the theme of the entire show. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=443.88000000000005s)]
*  He was there to do every single thing except have an exchange of ideas with me. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=448.24s)]
*  Everything. It was from, it was either, I'm going to go on, you know, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  the long appeal to authority or I'm going to play ridiculous semantics games [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=458.12s)]
*  with you. Like when I say we are at war, you'll say, we are, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=464.12s)]
*  we at war and you're not at war. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=467.2s)]
*  Your military is having an action and you're not and just contradicting himself [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=469.48s)]
*  constantly. The things he, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=473.88s)]
*  like instead of ever taking on my argument, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=478.68s)]
*  he would think it was a big blow to be like, you haven't been there. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=481.0s)]
*  You haven't been there. You don't have expertise. You don't, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=484.68s)]
*  it's so bizarre because it's like, this would be, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=487.36s)]
*  look, I'm not saying I would agree with it, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=492.28s)]
*  but at least it would make sense if Douglas Murray refused to debate me and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=494.04s)]
*  then made a video about why he wouldn't debate me. And in the video, he said, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=498.4s)]
*  because he doesn't have expertise and because he hasn't been there and because, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=502.44s)]
*  okay. But once you agreed to the debate, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=506.08s)]
*  you can't just say I have expertise and you don't have experts. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=509.28s)]
*  You can't spend 40 minutes on that. It's like demonstrate it motherfucker. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=512.68s)]
*  If you've been there and that gives you some greater insight, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=517.4s)]
*  then demonstrate that and win the argument and counter what I'm saying. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=520.16s)]
*  He would never, I mean the entire thing, it was straw man. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=524.68s)]
*  He would argue against what other people are saying. You know, if I said, Oh, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=530.0s)]
*  the, the NED and the USAID poured a hundred million dollars into the Maidan [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=534.24s)]
*  protests in 2014, he'd go, you know, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=538.36s)]
*  sometimes libertarians speak as if everything that happens in the world is done [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  by America. And really there are no other actors and nobody else has agency. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=545.72s)]
*  And I'm like, what? No, all the people there have agency. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=550.2s)]
*  Also the US poured a hundred million dollars into a street putsch that overthrew [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=553.1600000000001s)]
*  a democratically elected government. Like what, no matter who I'd say, dude, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=556.24s)]
*  his big like blows that he tried to land were I'm not an expert, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=559.44s)]
*  but I present myself as an expert. And then I said, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=563.96s)]
*  I don't claim to be an expert. And he said, see, that's the problem. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=566.9200000000001s)]
*  I haven't been there. I haven't been to Israel. So therefore, well, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't know, can't comment on it. And then at the end, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=575.04s)]
*  what I, I literally cited that the Supreme Commander of the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=579.76s)]
*  ally of the NATO forces and the four star general, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=585.0799999999999s)]
*  Wesley Clark said that the plans to overthrow seven different governments came [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=588.64s)]
*  from Paul Wolfowitz. And he said, I, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=592.48s)]
*  I shouldn't say Paul Wolfowitz because that'll make people hate Jews or [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=594.56s)]
*  something like that. I can't mention the deputy defense secretary, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  anyway, I don't know. You could tell me what you thought of it, but it was a, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=604.84s)]
*  it was, I don't really think I particularly won the debate. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=608.6s)]
*  I think he just showed up trying to do anything. He could not to debate. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  It was transparent. People could see through it. It was smug and condescending. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=617.2s)]
*  And that's why the reaction is what it is. That's kind of my thoughts. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=621.48s)]
*  I first, it did an excellent job. It was a, it was a fun watch. I, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  I knew that this was happening for a while and I was very excited for it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=630.32s)]
*  And that was a good recap there to hop into the Paul Wolfowitz thing, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=633.64s)]
*  just cause it's the last thing you said. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=637.52s)]
*  And then maybe we could address some of the others cause they were all just such [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=638.84s)]
*  fascinating points. But let's start with the Paul Wolfowitz one. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=642.4s)]
*  You mentioned the name and it was so not the point of what you [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=647.2s)]
*  were trying to address. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=652.32s)]
*  I think you guys were having a conversation about the regime changes in the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=654.0s)]
*  area and in the agency and you were trying to say, no, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=657.32s)]
*  America's clearly had an involvement. And he said that as an aside, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=660.44s)]
*  and he scoffed and you're like, well, why is that part funny? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=663.12s)]
*  And then he circled it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=666.2s)]
*  He circled it back into an argument with himself about the detail that he picked [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=667.44s)]
*  up, which was the guy's name and then saying, well, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=672.12s)]
*  what you're doing is bad for the Jews because it creates this, uh, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=674.64s)]
*  this narrative that the Jews run the world, blah, blah, blah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=678.92s)]
*  But it's like, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=681.2s)]
*  that was a minute side point from the bigger thing that you guys had been [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=681.64s)]
*  arguing with. He managed to circle himself into his own argument, which, uh, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=686.12s)]
*  I thought we said, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=690.24s)]
*  it's all just like when you say, and I know, look, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=692.12s)]
*  there are a few people out there I did see who are like the, the hard, you know, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=694.92s)]
*  look, I mean with all of these things, the hardcore Israel supporters, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  some of them are just locked in and they're think somehow that was a really [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=702.1999999999999s)]
*  great point when he told me I haven't been to Israel or something, you know, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=705.24s)]
*  like, but which is ridiculous. It's, it's objectively a non-argument. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=708.4399999999999s)]
*  Um, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=713.0s)]
*  I thought you crushed him on that one and it actually got kind of dropped, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=713.64s)]
*  but I think if you can tell me if maybe I miss, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=718.48s)]
*  if I misheard this because it kind of moved quickly, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=720.8s)]
*  he had said that you need to be there. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=723.68s)]
*  You had a great point about the Nazi Germany thing, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=724.84s)]
*  but then he had a secondary point, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=727.4s)]
*  which is weren't you there at the beginning of the Ukraine war and said we [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=728.8s)]
*  could win it, which is well then I thought that was such a bombshell of you were [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=731.48s)]
*  on the ground. Oh yeah. I thought no, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=736.04s)]
*  I did ground reporting and you got the story wrong. So what, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=737.8s)]
*  what is being there do if that just gives you actually a bad take, dude, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=741.04s)]
*  all of them, listen, all of it, it's, it's objectively, they're non-arguments. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=745.4s)]
*  They're just non-arguments you get in, in a debate in the spirit of a debate, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=749.84s)]
*  you get zero points for that. You haven't been there. Okay, fine. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=753.52s)]
*  So what's the point grapple with my argument. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=756.72s)]
*  I'm sitting there the whole time. Like let's debate this. He's like, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=760.24s)]
*  let's debate Darrell Cooper and Ian Carroll, two people I know nothing about, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=763.68s)]
*  admittedly don't even know their names, admittedly have never consumed their [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  content. That's where he starts with. I know, by the way, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=770.4399999999999s)]
*  you have to be an expertise in the subject matter that you talk about, you know, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=773.16s)]
*  while demonstrating none of it. But the idea, look, number one, um, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=776.52s)]
*  the appeal to authority obviously is a logical fallacy on top of that. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=781.8s)]
*  Joe has had many experts on many different subjects. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=785.52s)]
*  Douglas's issue, look, his issue isn't the proportionality, like he said, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=790.0s)]
*  or that Joe Rogan doesn't have enough experts on. I mean, listen, like he, he, uh, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=794.48s)]
*  he didn't complain. I brought up, he was like, who have you had on, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=799.32s)]
*  who's on this side? And I brought up Coleman Hughes and like some other, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=802.08s)]
*  Coleman Hughes is not an expert on the Israeli Palestinian conflict, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=804.9200000000001s)]
*  but he doesn't seem to have a problem with what he said on the show. He's not, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=808.44s)]
*  he's going, Oh, you've had more, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=811.48s)]
*  you've had way more people who are critical of the war in Ukraine and critical [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=813.6s)]
*  of the war in Palestine than those who support it on. What does that mean? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=817.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan is an obligation to be a 50 50. What type of equity bullshit is this? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=821.0400000000001s)]
*  Do you think Douglas Murray is upset that Joe Rogan had more pro Trump people [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=826.08s)]
*  than pro Kamala people on? Cause he did. Is he upset about that? No, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=829.88s)]
*  cause he agrees with that. He agrees with it. So if he agrees with it, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=834.4s)]
*  he wouldn't have a problem. He's just, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=837.6s)]
*  he just wants more people spouting his shit on there. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=838.8s)]
*  But it's just such a weird thing to start the show complaining about. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=841.48s)]
*  But then also look, there are, look, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=844.92s)]
*  the fact is there are an unlimited number of, um, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=848.88s)]
*  of experts, not an unlimited number, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=853.28s)]
*  but a large, large number of experts on the Israel Palestine conflict. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=855.3199999999999s)]
*  Many of them are on the pro Israel side. Many of them are critical of Israel. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=860.0799999999999s)]
*  Like it's not the case that you can, many people who have been to Israel, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=863.88s)]
*  you know, agree with me. Many people have been there, agree with, with, uh, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=868.76s)]
*  uh, Douglas, it's just a non point. It's nothing. You get zero points for that. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=874.16s)]
*  And then of course, every time I would make, I mean, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=878.68s)]
*  he was just evasive about everything. So if I go like, um, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  if I were to say, you know, like, um, uh, whatever the one point I said to him, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=885.92s)]
*  uh, he was like, you know, the war wasn't over, uh, Ukraine entry into NATO. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=890.0799999999999s)]
*  And, um, and I was like, okay, well, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=895.56s)]
*  you got to admit they said forever that that was their brightest red line. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=897.3199999999999s)]
*  And then there's all these people at the top level of our intelligence who said, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=900.48s)]
*  you know, when they say this is the red line, I think they really mean it. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=903.48s)]
*  I think we better not flirt with crossing this red line. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=907.0s)]
*  And then we kept flirting with crossing the red line and he'd be like, oh, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=909.4s)]
*  so now you trust the head of the CIA. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=912.8s)]
*  As if like there's some contradiction, like, yeah, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=916.0s)]
*  now I love the organization that is the CIA. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=917.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying even the CIA head himself admitted, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=920.28s)]
*  they all say this is the brightest of red lines and I think they mean it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=923.52s)]
*  And I think this might lead to war that like, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=927.36s)]
*  you're not taking on the argument at all. And then he'd go, well, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=929.8s)]
*  it wasn't about NATO expansion and say something else about how Putin wants to [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=932.8399999999999s)]
*  constitute the Soviet union. And I'd say, okay, well, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=936.24s)]
*  the head of NATO literally said that Vladimir Putin sent him a draft treaty [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=939.68s)]
*  saying just put into writing that you won't bring Ukraine into NATO. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=944.5200000000001s)]
*  And then I won't invade right before he invaded. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=949.1600000000001s)]
*  And he'll go, the war was never about that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=952.9200000000001s)]
*  And then there's always this feeling that it's about the Americans and it's [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=955.24s)]
*  always about what we're doing. And it's not, it's like, you didn't counter the art. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=958.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, like he's just not, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=961.7600000000001s)]
*  he was there to do anything he could do except grapple with any of the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=963.0s)]
*  arguments because you know, on some level he knows the shit is indefensible. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what to say. And so I think, uh, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=971.36s)]
*  it in a weird way, I ended up, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=976.5600000000001s)]
*  I think I ended up just collecting kind of an easy win on that. I mean, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=978.16s)]
*  I'm glad people are telling me I did a good job. I'm glad people feel that way, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=981.64s)]
*  but, uh, it just seemed almost like, oh, he's just kind of hanging himself. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=985.32s)]
*  I mean, think about like that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  He came in and picked a fight with the moderator and then essentially the entire [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=991.6s)]
*  audience. It was like Jesus Christ. And I just think that whatever, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=996.2s)]
*  at least from what I've seen of the reaction and I do tend to like, you know, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1001.2800000000001s)]
*  I tried my best to not like live in the YouTube comments, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1004.2800000000001s)]
*  but on a show like this, it's kind of impossible for me to not, you know, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1008.88s)]
*  when you do this on, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1011.8000000000001s)]
*  it's not like if I do a show in front of my audience where I kind of, you know, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1012.76s)]
*  I know my audience knows me very well and I know them very well. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1017.2s)]
*  And at this point, the Joe Rogan audience knows me, but it's not the same. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1020.6s)]
*  And it's such a huge show that you're like, oh, I like, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1024.44s)]
*  I'm kind of interested how people responded to this. And it was, I mean, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1028.36s)]
*  the second I looked through the comments, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1033.12s)]
*  it was like exactly what I said after the show, exactly what everyone there, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1035.48s)]
*  cause he like left right after. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1038.8s)]
*  And I asked a bunch of the people who are there and like, watch it like, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1040.1599999999999s)]
*  Hey, what'd you guys think brutally honest? Like, what'd you think? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1042.1599999999999s)]
*  And they were all like, Oh, he just killed himself like right away. And I was like, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1044.48s)]
*  yeah. And then that's what every single comment was. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1048.52s)]
*  Every comment was just like torching him for those. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1050.4399999999998s)]
*  He couldn't even figure out what he was saying. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1053.52s)]
*  It felt like for the first, like 40, and he took 40 minutes. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1055.8s)]
*  He took like 40 minutes of the thing and just dragged it into this struggle [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1059.48s)]
*  session. It was so wild to sit there watching. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1062.92s)]
*  I'd love to take on some of the logic of the arguments he was putting forward. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1065.8799999999999s)]
*  So the first one is we're not experts. And so if we aren't experts, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1069.84s)]
*  we should be very easy to dismantle. And if anything, we're round one, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1075.04s)]
*  and if you can't get through our questioning or your questioning, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1079.4s)]
*  then there's no reason to have to escalate it to having a conversation with [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1083.3999999999999s)]
*  an expert because wow, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1087.32s)]
*  this is the degree by which the expert class is lying about a topic that someone [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1089.1599999999999s)]
*  is dumb as me take, take COVID, take green energy, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1094.6399999999999s)]
*  take a lot of these topics that the expert class told us we weren't allowed to [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1098.28s)]
*  question, take the track record of this show. It's, it's, if anything, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1101.9599999999998s)]
*  it's showcasing the degree by which the expert class is lying and abusing, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1106.32s)]
*  abusing that title that they fall apart under questioning and they need to [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1110.8799999999999s)]
*  appeal to authority and go, Hey, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1115.2s)]
*  we can't have other people questioning this stuff or not. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1117.48s)]
*  No one else is supposed to have an opinion. We need you to trust the experts. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1120.3999999999999s)]
*  That's the only way that society functions. Well, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1123.9199999999998s)]
*  then if you guys are the experts and we're not, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1126.28s)]
*  you should be very comfortable to hop into the ideas, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1128.2s)]
*  have the arguments and dismantle them. And if you're unable to do that, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1131.56s)]
*  maybe you shouldn't have the expert title or maybe you're abusing it. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1135.44s)]
*  Yeah. But also like, you know, it's right. And he made, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1139.16s)]
*  he would make some arguments or like that were things that, yeah, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1142.4s)]
*  neither me nor Joe would have disagreed with. Like what he was saying, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1147.24s)]
*  the thing where he was like, okay, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1150.16s)]
*  I understand the experts have discredited themselves, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1151.52s)]
*  but that doesn't mean we need to turn over every single stone or just have [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1153.84s)]
*  everything. And you're like, yeah, sure. Okay. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  That's why you have to be judicious about it. But like, now let's be judicious. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1159.48s)]
*  We're here to talk about the issue. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1163.2s)]
*  Let's see if you have an actual argument. Like it was enough, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1165.76s)]
*  like it almost felt like that whole thing, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1168.28s)]
*  like what I was saying before when I was like, it would kind of make sense. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1170.68s)]
*  If, uh, if he had refused the debate and then was saying why he refused the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1174.24s)]
*  debate. And it was like, Oh, this guy's beneath me. He's not an expert, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1181.04s)]
*  which by the way, I thought is, uh, I saw Sager, uh, and, and Jenny, who I love, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1184.36s)]
*  uh, he posted today and he's like, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1189.0s)]
*  he has a bachelor's in like English or something, which I didn't even know. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1190.44s)]
*  He's like totally just not an expert on anything. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1195.1200000000001s)]
*  It's the weirdest argument to be making. Um, but you know, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1197.72s)]
*  I've made more tea than you, Dave. Yeah. So, so, you know, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1201.0400000000002s)]
*  well he's a, but like, he's making this, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1205.96s)]
*  this argument and there is something about it that, um, and I, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1208.44s)]
*  and I'm not saying like, again, it's like, he's coming into a fight. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1212.48s)]
*  It's like we've agreed to fight. And then before, like, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1216.88s)]
*  it's just like when the bell rings, he's like, well, let's just do like, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1220.5200000000002s)]
*  I just want to tell you for 40 minutes, like, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1223.76s)]
*  I'm such a better fighter than you. I mean, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1225.92s)]
*  it's crazy that I'm even fighting you. This is just kind of ridiculous. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1227.68s)]
*  Like why would I fight someone like you? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1231.08s)]
*  And I'm like standing here with my gloves up like, yeah, okay. But like, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1233.24s)]
*  are we come on? I think we're going to fight now and we'll fit. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1235.96s)]
*  You can show me if you're better than me at this. Uh, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1239.04s)]
*  and then once it comes to that, it's like, he has nothing. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1242.12s)]
*  It's always so shocking. Like they just have nothing. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1244.2s)]
*  The same way I felt after the Dennis Pregma, he didn't have one, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1246.92s)]
*  like real argument. There wasn't anything that I said that it was like, Oh shit, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1249.24s)]
*  he took that on and really knew better than may they'd be like, okay, you know, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1253.08s)]
*  the world bank said that the, the, um, the embargo in 96, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1257.08s)]
*  which wasn't as severe as the full blockade that's been around it since, uh, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1262.04s)]
*  2007, they said just for the one year of it, it, it, they said, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1266.44s)]
*  it caused a 40% retraction in the economy of Gaza. You know, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1270.6399999999999s)]
*  the great depression was a 30% contraction, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1274.6s)]
*  but we gave them a great depression one year. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1277.3999999999999s)]
*  Now you've had this blockade on them since 2007. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1279.2s)]
*  What do you think that's done to the economy? And his response is, Oh, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1282.2800000000002s)]
*  so you trust the world bank now. Very convenient. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1285.3200000000002s)]
*  Like is that really taking on the argument? Okay. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1289.44s)]
*  Maybe their estimate isn't perfect or whatever. Who's like, do you know, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1291.8000000000002s)]
*  obviously you've also never seen the border crossing. So why would, uh, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1295.48s)]
*  for analytics like that even be able to compliment your analysis? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1299.48s)]
*  Right. Exactly. I mean, it's just, it's just totally ridiculous. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1303.68s)]
*  Like just complete non-arguments. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1308.0s)]
*  You'd only embrace these tactics if you had nothing. Um, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1309.76s)]
*  but I do think there's also, and I do, I think part of the reason why, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1313.6s)]
*  like that part, that, uh, that clip actually, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1317.1599999999999s)]
*  so far as you want to see, you could, if you want to bring that up, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1320.76s)]
*  maybe we could play that clip. Cause I think this one was, uh, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1323.8799999999999s)]
*  I saw it was getting shared a lot. And I think it was one of the moments it's, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1326.84s)]
*  you know, I kind of felt like, you know, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1330.6799999999998s)]
*  in a weird way it was a little bit similar to the Cuomo debate dynamic where, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1332.0s)]
*  like when I debated Chris Cuomo, I had like this huge, it's, um, by the way, uh, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1336.68s)]
*  so far as if you go to my Twitter, it's a chief nerd posted it. So it's, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1341.1599999999999s)]
*  I retweeted it somewhere, but if you want to grab that, um, but, uh, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1345.2s)]
*  you know, I had this huge advantage when I debated, uh, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1350.12s)]
*  Chris Cuomo because it's like the entire audience that we're talking to already [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1353.04s)]
*  as decided, they agree with me, not you on this. You know what I mean? Like it's, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1357.84s)]
*  we're talking about the Iraq war now. It's everybody agrees. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1362.0s)]
*  This thing was a mistake. There's no, like, you know, it's just, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1365.28s)]
*  it's as unanimous as an issue can get. And even though somewhat ironically, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1367.6s)]
*  even though like Donald Trump was the president through 2020 and was the, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1372.68s)]
*  you know, the buck stops with him. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1377.72s)]
*  He was the guy who made a lot of the terrible calls yet in our very [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1379.12s)]
*  interesting political climate. Only five years later, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1383.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's entire base is with Bobby Kennedy on the health stuff, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1388.36s)]
*  not with, you know what I mean? Any of that shit, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1392.52s)]
*  like everybody's rejected the COVID stuff as being bullshit. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1394.76s)]
*  And so in the wake of that, the biggest, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1399.12s)]
*  like the biggest thing that we've ever like collectively lived through, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1402.72s)]
*  and there's this huge unanimous consent or damn near close that [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1407.8799999999999s)]
*  the unanimous agreement that, okay, yeah, all the experts got this wrong. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1413.0s)]
*  All of this was bullshit and all the mantra of trust the science and only listen [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1417.96s)]
*  to the experts was all just bullshit so that they could propaganda's [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1422.52s)]
*  propagandize us with lies for him to even be attempting to make that argument. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1426.08s)]
*  I just have this entire, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1431.64s)]
*  I have this huge advantage just because like the entire [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1432.76s)]
*  Rogan base is just like, Oh yeah, but that's everything we just rejected. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1437.6s)]
*  You're making the exact argument that we all just saw was complete bullshit. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1441.6s)]
*  So I don't know. I think it was just, again, it was kind of handed to me. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1445.96s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, let's let's play the clip and then we could, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1450.72s)]
*  we could discuss a little, I guess. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1454.28s)]
*  I do also think that one of the bigger kind of the bigger picture dynamics to all [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1456.76s)]
*  of this is that we have at least since 9 11 been in a state of perpetual war and [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1462.3600000000001s)]
*  all of these wars have been disasters. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1470.88s)]
*  They have been so many lies involved in selling all of them. I mean, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1474.16s)]
*  oh, the whole Iraq war, the whole war in Afghanistan, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1478.24s)]
*  just lying the whole way through. I mean, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1482.0s)]
*  I remember literally having conversations with green berets in the middle of the [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  war in Afghanistan and they're like, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1488.0800000000002s)]
*  George W. Bush is telling you that the army we're building up there is really [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1490.0s)]
*  successful. This thing's going to fall in a week without us. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1493.3200000000002s)]
*  And then all through the Obama administration, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1496.68s)]
*  it's just like lie after lie after lie with disastrous wars. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1498.5600000000002s)]
*  And so this does create a fertile ground for people to say, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1501.72s)]
*  I wonder if they were lying about all these wars. Again, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1505.72s)]
*  I'm not really trying to argue for one second. I'll go, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1507.96s)]
*  I'll be a, I I'm sorry. I just got to run an open a door. I'll be right back. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1512.8s)]
*  Anyway. Okay. So, sorry. Where were we here? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1516.28s)]
*  Okay. So I was talking about how we, they, they lied to us into all these wars. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1521.28s)]
*  It's created fertile ground for, for people to believe their line about other [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1525.16s)]
*  things. All right, guys, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1529.44s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Ridge wallet, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1531.88s)]
*  they love these guys. You gotta get a Ridge wallet. I love it myself. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1536.92s)]
*  I use it all the time. You don't need the old school, big clunky leathery wallet. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1541.32s)]
*  It's throwing your spine out. It's not cool looking. The Ridge is unique, slim. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1545.96s)]
*  It's modern design holds up to 12 cards plus cash, everything you need. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1550.96s)]
*  It's made with premium materials like aluminum, titanium, and carbon fiber. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1555.8799999999999s)]
*  They just look awesome. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1560.3999999999999s)]
*  There's over 50 colors and styles to choose from and they're all really cool. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1561.72s)]
*  Check them out. All Ridge products have a lifetime warranty. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1565.56s)]
*  This is literally the last wallet you'll ever have to buy. There's a reason. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1568.52s)]
*  It has over 100,000 five star reviews. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1572.2s)]
*  So lose your old wallet and grab the Ridge. They also have air track attachments. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1576.0s)]
*  So you'll always know exactly where it is before panic mode kicks in. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1580.9199999999998s)]
*  And right now Ridge is having their once a year anniversary sale. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1584.44s)]
*  Get up to 40% off at ridge.com slash P O T P 10. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1587.8s)]
*  That's ridge.com slash P O T P 10 for up to 40% off. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1593.44s)]
*  All right. Let's get back on the show. Yeah. Let's keep playing. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1599.92s)]
*  Interesting question is whether you're busy watering it. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1603.0800000000002s)]
*  What should you not talk about mistakes that were made overall? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1606.0800000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. Right. All four go back and looking at mistakes. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1610.04s)]
*  So what are you, what is your argument then? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1614.28s)]
*  It's a very weird thing to go back, zone in on a man, say this one thing is a [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1615.96s)]
*  mistake and should characterize him and you ignore everything. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1622.0s)]
*  You're taking him out of a second. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1625.16s)]
*  Just, just to be clear here, what Douglas is arguing about. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1628.56s)]
*  So it had started on Darrell Cooper whose name Douglas says he doesn't know. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1632.12s)]
*  He literally goes, Darren Cooper, Darrell Cooper, and then something like that. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1637.56s)]
*  And then Joe asked him at one point if he had ever consumed any of his work. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1641.44s)]
*  He says, no, I don't need to. I don't know anything about him. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1644.64s)]
*  He's talking about one line he said on Tucker Carlson's podcast. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1647.04s)]
*  Then he's saying the problem with Darrell Cooper is that he takes a guy in Winston [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1649.72s)]
*  Churchill and judges him off one thing and doesn't look at his full body of work. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1655.84s)]
*  That's what he's arguing. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1667.1200000000001s)]
*  Does anybody see a problem there? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1669.32s)]
*  $10 to the first for the first person who can point out the logical contradiction [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1673.68s)]
*  in that argument. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1679.16s)]
*  Anyway, it's just unreal. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1682.24s)]
*  There. Let's keep playing. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1683.44s)]
*  When you're talking about Darrell, who's done. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1685.4s)]
*  What was it? 30 plus hours. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1687.6000000000001s)]
*  So what? 30 plus hours. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1689.3600000000001s)]
*  But you take you do that in a week. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1691.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's a very, it's a very different thing. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1693.76s)]
*  He's not doing a podcast like talking to people. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1696.0s)]
*  Again, what a stupid point. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1698.3600000000001s)]
*  Pause it for a second. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1700.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, what a stupid point. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1702.2s)]
*  Like if I, if I, let's say I read a book on tape, which is really kind of what [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1703.68s)]
*  Darrell does with these things. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1708.84s)]
*  If I, if I sit down like with the effort to script out like a book, that is a [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1710.36s)]
*  different thing than like what me and you are doing right now and just count the [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1714.8799999999999s)]
*  hours that we've done this and then compare it to that. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1718.8799999999999s)]
*  That's like a written presentation, an oral presentation for 30 hours. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1721.56s)]
*  Do you know it? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1727.04s)]
*  Like, do you not see the difference between a 30 hour oral presentation going [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1727.6s)]
*  deep in depth on a topic and all of the players and all of the histories and what [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1732.4399999999998s)]
*  started every war and how the people suffered and what both sides, you know [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1737.04s)]
*  what I'm saying? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1740.52s)]
*  Like that book. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1740.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1743.2s)]
*  It's a giant book. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1743.56s)]
*  It's not having a conversation with, with people like, which is a challenge as [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1744.48s)]
*  well, but like, it's a totally different thing. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1748.12s)]
*  Um, all right. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1750.36s)]
*  Anyway, let's keep playing. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1751.12s)]
*  And the archives clearly come on. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1752.88s)]
*  I mean, this is, he is not the historian of our era. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1754.4s)]
*  He's not complaining to me. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1757.64s)]
*  This is the thing, Joe. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1759.24s)]
*  This is like punching jelly. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1760.4s)]
*  No, but you, you don't, you don't consume, but you can dance around work. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1761.96s)]
*  I'm saying because I don't need to consume endless versions of a revisionist history. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1765.64s)]
*  I understand. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1771.32s)]
*  I know where this comes from. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1772.52s)]
*  It's not revisionist history. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1773.28s)]
*  If you listen to his work, it's not revisionist history. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1774.48s)]
*  He's basing it on historical work. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1777.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1779.88s)]
*  But okay. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1780.3600000000001s)]
*  So this is my point about jelly. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1781.32s)]
*  It's a shape shifting thing, comedian or historian. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1783.68s)]
*  He's not a comedian. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1787.68s)]
*  Historian or podcast would be historian or actual historian. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1788.84s)]
*  You say he doesn't claim to be a historian, but he's pumping out tens of hours of [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1793.4s)]
*  Dan Carlin. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1798.0800000000002s)]
*  He doesn't claim to be a story. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1799.4s)]

*  It's like, that's what we're here to do. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2107.0400000000004s)]
*  But I'm confused. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2110.2400000000002s)]
*  Do it then. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2111.2000000000003s)]
*  So what's the other side of it? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2111.96s)]
*  Give it to me. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2113.8s)]
*  Present the argument. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2115.76s)]
*  That is just so wild. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2117.84s)]
*  It's so well, it's just, I don't know what any, again, it's, and the reason, look, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2119.36s)]
*  like I said, like the comments have overwhelmingly just been like, yeah. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2123.32s)]
*  And again, as you can see here, it's really not anything I'm doing. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2126.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, I'm there and I'm me and I'm arguing my points, but it's just, it's all [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2129.44s)]
*  the stuff he's doing. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2133.2s)]
*  That's just like, this is too easy to see through. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2134.16s)]
*  This is garbage. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2136.08s)]
*  And I did notice it's like, I got a lot of comments. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2137.3199999999997s)]
*  But why do I have to hear it from a peasant and why do I even have to address it? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2141.48s)]
*  I'll say this, and this is kind of how you, you measure these things in a way, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2147.52s)]
*  because there's always a certain percentage of people who have like their [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2150.7999999999997s)]
*  feet dug in, who aren't going to move. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2153.24s)]
*  Like I said before, when you have guys with a big enough audience, there's [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2154.8799999999997s)]
*  enough of their hardcore fans who no matter what are going to say, yeah, they [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2159.08s)]
*  want, and I do got to say, I think some, in a way, I think some low IQ people are [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2162.6s)]
*  kind of fooled by his bravado and the, just the, it's all delivery and [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2167.2799999999997s)]
*  performance, but no substance at all. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2171.96s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2174.68s)]
*  Um, but I got a lot of people who were saying to me, man, I actually was kind [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2175.68s)]
*  of a Douglas Murray fan until this, like they just, he just laid it on so thick [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2180.24s)]
*  that it kind of exposed like, look, man, all of this, it's not, it's so obviously [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2184.36s)]
*  evasive to just write, like you said, Rob, admit like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2188.96s)]
*  What you're actually saying has a point, but let me move back to some other, and [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2192.0s)]
*  then this claim again, like it's, I mean, this, there's must've been said so many [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2197.04s)]
*  times, you present yourself as an expert. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2202.44s)]
*  I'm not an expert. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2204.32s)]
*  I'm just talking about these things. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2205.16s)]
*  You're allowed to talk about these things. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2206.44s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2207.96s)]
*  So then what's the problem here? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2208.64s)]
*  Well, the problem is you go back and forth from expert to comedian. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2210.0s)]
*  It's like, well, what do you mean by that? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2212.92s)]
*  I mean, look here, let's keep playing and then we'll, we'll kind of get into that, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2214.96s)]
*  that point a little bit more. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2217.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, if, if, if, if somebody says you have to claim to be an expert on something, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2219.44s)]
*  to have an opinion on something, you don't have to be, you don't have to be. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2224.08s)]
*  But this is like, I'm not a historian, but I'm pumping out history, but I'm not an [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2226.96s)]
*  expert, but I'm talking all the time about, but you're not even talking about [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2231.36s)]
*  specifically on what he just said. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2234.2000000000003s)]
*  No, I was saying this is my point about this. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2236.28s)]
*  He, you say, I'm not an expert. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2238.76s)]
*  So, God bless Joe Rogan because he's really, he is trying to keep it civil and [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2241.4s)]
*  be as nice as possible, but he's just like, that sure does seem like the thing [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2247.72s)]
*  you're saying doesn't at all address the very reasonable thing that he just said. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2251.3599999999997s)]
*  Like what, that you even admitted was reasonable. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2255.04s)]
*  So like you got anything for that as just no, anything except arguing any of the [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2257.24s)]
*  wars, anything except actually putting up a debate, putting up a grappling with [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2262.0s)]
*  anything I'm saying. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2267.08s)]
*  Um, all right, let's play the last little bit. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2268.3999999999996s)]
*  Did not talk about it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2271.3999999999996s)]
*  No, it's to have more experts around. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2272.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, the expert hasn't done a great job. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2276.4s)]
*  No, this is followed the science. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2278.28s)]
*  I just said to you, I agree with that. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2281.88s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2283.6s)]
*  So Douglas, during all of COVID, I will put my track record against any of the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2283.88s)]
*  expert class on COVID. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2289.08s)]
*  I'm glad to do that. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2291.08s)]
*  So should I have just shut up? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2292.56s)]
*  Should I have shut up by opposing lockdowns and opposing vaccine mandates? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2293.76s)]
*  And so that was the argument at the time you realize that's the entire argument [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2297.12s)]
*  that you're making. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2300.36s)]
*  Let the expert handle it. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2301.08s)]
*  He's not. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2303.44s)]
*  No, is it like, it's, it's like, and he has the nerve to say that me and Joe were [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2304.88s)]
*  like jelly. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2310.08s)]
*  It's like, like, dude, you couldn't pin them down on anything, anything. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2311.6s)]
*  He says he won't just stand for, and, and, you know, look, I'm sorry, this, this [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2315.12s)]
*  thing to this claim, which people try to make, right. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2319.6s)]
*  I mean, he's the only one I've ever had actually like, try to make this in a [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2324.88s)]
*  debate, but I've seen other people like say it online and stuff, but the idea [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2327.52s)]
*  that it's like, Hey, look, you're just a comedian and you present yourself as [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2331.44s)]
*  this expert, but then you always have this like parachute like, Oh, but I'm just [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2336.32s)]
*  a comedian. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2340.96s)]
*  First of all, which Douglas later, the debate directly accused me of like, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2344.32s)]
*  that's what he said. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2347.8s)]
*  And it's just like, I don't know how many times I have to say it to him. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2349.0s)]
*  He has to be like a drunk woman and just pretend he hasn't heard it every single [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2351.84s)]
*  time and keep saying it again. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2356.0s)]
*  There's really no contradiction here. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2357.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't put myself out as the expert. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2361.8799999999997s)]
*  I never sit here on the show and say, I'm the, in all of the issues that we talk [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2365.3599999999997s)]
*  about, okay, Rob, like all the big issues that we've been known for. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2369.6s)]
*  It is, doesn't it always go without saying, and I think I probably repeat it [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2374.2s)]
*  quite a bit. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2378.3199999999997s)]
*  I say the words, I'm not an expert quite a lot. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2379.3999999999996s)]
*  Actually. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2382.3599999999997s)]
*  I make that very clear. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2382.8799999999997s)]
*  Obviously when we were talking, is there any confusion? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2385.0s)]
*  Does anybody who listens to this show, does anybody you think who listens to me [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2388.04s)]
*  on Joe Rogan, if I'm talking about the, the wars in whatever country, if I'm [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2391.4399999999996s)]
*  talking about, if I was talking about the COVID COVID, does anybody think that I'm [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2397.64s)]
*  claiming to be a virologist or an epidemiologist or somebody who has studied [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2401.4399999999996s)]
*  this, my hope that is the expert on the issue. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2406.16s)]
*  And am I ever no, every time I'm going there, what I do on, on this show too, is [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2408.6s)]
*  I always bend over backward to flood people with the experts that have informed [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2413.7200000000003s)]
*  me and with the experts who I think are getting it right. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2419.4s)]
*  And yeah, like I said, I'm a free American. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2422.52s)]
*  I'm allowed to have opinions on things and make arguments and be like, I, this [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2424.2000000000003s)]
*  guy's case is stronger than this guy's case. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2427.48s)]
*  And no, I'm not an expert in any of the things that we talk about, but I am right [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2429.44s)]
*  about just about all of them. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2434.56s)]
*  And I have, and me and you, Rob, I'm sorry. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2437.16s)]
*  We've been right about all the major issues over the last few years. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2438.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2441.7200000000003s)]
*  It's just the facts. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2442.52s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2443.88s)]
*  And then when, when it's this thing, it's like, I also have been doing standup [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2445.0s)]
*  comedy for like 20 years and I tour all around the country and do standup comedy. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2449.1600000000003s)]
*  I do both of those things. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2454.1200000000003s)]
*  I talk on a podcast about my views and I also do standup comedy and people who [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2456.0s)]
*  come out and see the shows, enjoy them and have a very good time. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2460.6000000000004s)]
*  I make a nice living doing both. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2463.44s)]
*  There's no contradiction there. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2466.0400000000004s)]
*  And as for this thing that it's like a parachute, has there ever been a time in [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2467.76s)]
*  all little, okay. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2471.92s)]
*  There, there was one time, one time, literally. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2472.7200000000003s)]
*  It was when I debated Sam Cedar, I was very green. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2477.32s)]
*  This was a long time ago. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2482.08s)]
*  I, this has gotta be Jesus Christ. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2483.2000000000003s)]
*  10 years ago, at least I think over 10. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2485.08s)]
*  I think maybe closer to 15, I think, but regardless, it was like a Brown 15 years [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2488.56s)]
*  ago and it was a phone call into the thing. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2494.4s)]
*  Whatever I did. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2497.7200000000003s)]
*  I just did a bad job. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2498.28s)]
*  I had a bad, you know, I had a bad debate. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2499.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, and then I do think at one point in that debate, I was like, look, dude, I'm [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2501.84s)]
*  not the expert, I'm just a comedian, but blah, blah, blah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2505.2000000000003s)]
*  I think this, and I remember people giving me shit for saying that. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2507.44s)]
*  And, um, I think that's the only time I've ever said it. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2510.56s)]
*  Has there ever been a time recently where like, I've made a point. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2514.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, I really believe this. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2518.2400000000002s)]
*  Someone made a counter argument to that. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2520.04s)]
*  And then my response was, well, Hey, I'm just a comedian. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2522.52s)]
*  I don't know what I'm talking about. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2524.76s)]
*  No, I never do that. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2525.6400000000003s)]
*  So there's nothing here to what he's talking about. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2527.88s)]
*  It's like, he's basically like, he doesn't think it's just a [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2530.72s)]
*  pure argument for credentialism. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  He doesn't think I should get to be on huge shows, making these points. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2535.6s)]
*  But you know what, Douglas, you're not in control of the world because there's a [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2539.36s)]
*  free market of ideas to some extent and you don't get to decide that. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2542.7599999999998s)]
*  And this is the way it is. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2547.4s)]
*  I am here on the show with you. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2548.44s)]
*  The thing is, once you're here on the show with me, you got to actually engage. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2550.12s)]
*  Have an argument, have some idea that you can't just sit here and talk about how [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2555.52s)]
*  you should. It shouldn't be me here. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2559.32s)]
*  Joe shouldn't be having us on. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2562.1600000000003s)]
*  He should only have people on who agree with you. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2563.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the other side, we are like quite happy to have everybody on. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2566.84s)]
*  Let's let's have the debate. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2571.2400000000002s)]
*  So, yeah, anything else? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2575.48s)]
*  Anything else that you that stuck out to you that we should we should bring up? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2576.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, it just on that point. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2580.44s)]
*  It's the fun thing about experts is they can correct us. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2581.6400000000003s)]
*  I could stand up in front of a mathematician and go to plus two equals four. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2584.0800000000004s)]
*  And I'll be like, well, that was right. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2588.1600000000003s)]
*  And then if I said something really stupid, you'd go, that was wrong. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2589.52s)]
*  And guess what? I might not be an expert in American immigration policy, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2592.36s)]
*  but I could tell you that during the Biden administration, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2596.0s)]
*  they were clearly pulling something to get as many people across the border as possible. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2598.7200000000003s)]
*  And when they said, hey, we need to legalize five thousand people a day [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2603.08s)]
*  before we have the authority to close the border, I don't need to be an expert [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2606.84s)]
*  in United States law to go. That sounds like bullshit to me. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2610.56s)]
*  And you know how many topics we did that for all of covid? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2614.08s)]
*  We've done that for hundreds of topics to go. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2616.64s)]
*  Hey, I'm listening to the argument that the expert class is putting forward [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2619.08s)]
*  the what the the information that the experts want us to believe. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2623.0s)]
*  And I'm calling bullshit. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2626.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes. And guess what? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2628.44s)]
*  If it was as dumb as me standing up in front of a mathematician [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2629.92s)]
*  and going to plus two equals five, it would be really easy to correct us. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2632.8399999999997s)]
*  But the expert class is a very good has done a very good job [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2636.48s)]
*  of lying and shilling for the regime, which is what leaves space [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2640.12s)]
*  for non experts like us to have platforms and comment on things to just go, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2643.8s)]
*  hey, I think the entire expert class or a large majority of the expert class [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2648.88s)]
*  is lying to us or sometimes just to sit down and really cypher [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2652.2000000000003s)]
*  through a lot of the information from the expert class and go, wow, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2656.2000000000003s)]
*  there's a lot of people who are lying about this. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2659.2000000000003s)]
*  But that John Mershom, my guy, seems to be making some really good [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2660.96s)]
*  arguments about the Ukraine war. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2663.96s)]
*  I've been reading all the coverage and everyone's been lying to me [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2665.96s)]
*  and telling me that we're going to win this war and we just have to support it [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2668.6400000000003s)]
*  and that Putin's going to take over all of Europe. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2671.7599999999998s)]
*  And I don't know, that just doesn't sound right. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2673.7599999999998s)]
*  And then you keep reading the information. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2676.2s)]
*  You keep seeing that we're not winning the war, that none of that information is true. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2677.7599999999998s)]
*  And then you find the other experts here like he still listens to him. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2681.2s)]
*  You're like, I kind of like this expert and you rehash that information. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2683.32s)]
*  I don't know, kind of doing a service of, you know, going through everything [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2686.36s)]
*  and just putting forward your critical reasoning. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2690.7599999999998s)]
*  So I don't really I just don't get the I mean, it's blanket. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2694.04s)]
*  It's obvious what he's doing. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2698.4s)]
*  It's this appeal to authority that only people like me who want to [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2699.64s)]
*  spew my talking point should be allowed to have a voice. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2703.8399999999997s)]
*  And so if you're not spewing exactly what I think people should know, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2707.08s)]
*  which we don't really want to have to contend with other people's [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2712.08s)]
*  arguments about, then you shouldn't be platformed. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2714.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's right. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2717.52s)]
*  That's that's all exactly right. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2718.88s)]
*  And, you know, I will say that there's there's something to it. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2720.52s)]
*  And perhaps, you know, like there's always whenever you do these debates, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2724.4s)]
*  there's always like, oh, I should have said this or I should have said this. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2727.6s)]
*  And, you know, the thing about it is, is like, I feel a little almost like, man, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2730.12s)]
*  I, you know, I should have gone a little bit harder and been a little more [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2733.96s)]
*  vicious at times. But at the same time, I think Joe was happy that it went this way. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2736.7999999999997s)]
*  And so I, you know, and I, I don't know, I got a lot of people like messaging me [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2740.52s)]
*  saying like they were they thought it was great that I was so, like, patient. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2745.8399999999997s)]
*  And so, like, was it to not get frustrated and lose my shit? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2749.44s)]
*  And then I got other people messaging me like, oh, I wanted you to fucking [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2753.52s)]
*  smash him and blah, blah, blah. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2756.64s)]
*  And I will say, even though the ones who are complimenting me, you know, I, I, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2758.12s)]
*  I want to agree with the people complimenting me, but my heart is totally [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2763.7999999999997s)]
*  with the people who are like, you should have been a little more vicious [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2768.6s)]
*  because I'm like, I do. But it is just I guess the thing that's so [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2770.8799999999997s)]
*  kind of infuriating about this, this obvious debate tactic, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2775.7999999999997s)]
*  which is again, is a tactic to avoid the debate, to come in there, to do anything [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2780.8399999999997s)]
*  except debate with me is that you immediately come in, you know, it's like, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2785.2s)]
*  so we kind of live, as everyone knows, we're kind of broadly in this new [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2788.9199999999996s)]
*  world where, okay, the kind of the, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2794.12s)]
*  the dominant internet censorship culture kind of faded [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2798.4399999999996s)]
*  away in a remarkably short period of time. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2803.52s)]
*  Like we literally went from a time where like it kind of looked like the handwriting [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2807.24s)]
*  was on the wall, that a show like, you know, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2811.48s)]
*  any dissident show was eventually going to get kicked off of all the major [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2815.28s)]
*  platforms. And, you know, there was a time where like people were being debanked [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2819.48s)]
*  and being, you know, banned across every single platform. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2824.68s)]
*  And at the same time, the Biden administration was trying to install a ministry of [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2828.16s)]
*  truth. And there was kind of like that. And now that's got Elon bought Twitter. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2832.04s)]
*  Trump wins a big election like that. That's all kind of like receded. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2835.48s)]
*  And now you have a little bit more of an open, you know, discourse. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2839.56s)]
*  And of course, when that happens, the dissident voices, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2843.08s)]
*  the voices who hate the regime, they get, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2846.72s)]
*  they get more of a chance to get their voice out there. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2849.72s)]
*  And so you get a lot more of this stuff bubbling up. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2852.64s)]
*  And this includes people who are just like against the policies of the [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2854.96s)]
*  regime. And it also includes people who are conspiracy theorists. Some of them, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2859.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, are more on point than others, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2864.0s)]
*  but there's something about like the role that people like Douglas Murray play [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2867.92s)]
*  and the trick they use to come in and go, like, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2873.04s)]
*  the first thing I want to talk about is I want you to feel bad about yourself [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2876.6s)]
*  for the fact that I think the conspiracy that you thought is wrong, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2881.6400000000003s)]
*  or you haven't called that this person who has this conspiracy or this person [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2886.32s)]
*  who has that conspiracy. And it's like, dude, come on. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2889.6800000000003s)]
*  Like even what he admitted there about COVID, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2893.6s)]
*  like he admitted there was a giant conspiracy that, okay. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2896.24s)]
*  And what was that conspiracy that the fucking thing, dude, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2898.52s)]
*  that the fucking pandemic, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2902.96s)]
*  that the entire corporate media and the entire media class used to [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2904.52s)]
*  install totalitarian lockdowns was a fucking lie that they had [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2909.24s)]
*  made the goddamn virus and then lied to cover it up and then instituted [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2914.04s)]
*  totalitarianism and then gave giant banker bailouts and corporate [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2918.8799999999997s)]
*  bailouts and then forced a bullshit jab on billions of people. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2924.4s)]
*  I mean, like the fucking, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2929.12s)]
*  the current president of the United States of America, who is, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2930.92s)]
*  I think the most popular political figure in America today was framed for [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2934.0s)]
*  treason by his own deep state. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2938.28s)]
*  They tried to smear him as a traitor to his country. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2941.04s)]
*  Then they tried to throw him in jail and then coincidentally, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2944.4s)]
*  nothing to do with that at all. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2947.92s)]
*  But the sniper did get a clean shot in his head from 130 yards away. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2949.2000000000003s)]
*  And you know, whatever, it's just that, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2952.8399999999997s)]
*  that has nothing to do with anything and sure he had been in a couple of black [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2954.6s)]
*  rock commercials and there's no data on any of his phones or whatever, but yeah, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2957.08s)]
*  his place had been professionally swiped, but whatever that I'm saying, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2960.3599999999997s)]
*  that part's unrelated completely. But anyway, is it, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2963.68s)]
*  and so in this environment where there is this just like, you know, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2967.08s)]
*  also like there was a freaking pedophile ring that can't, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2970.3599999999997s)]
*  must be a, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2975.16s)]
*  there's a pedophile ring that involves all the most powerful cultural and [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2976.7599999999998s)]
*  political figures in the United States of America. And the details of it have to be [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2979.88s)]
*  redacted for national security purposes, you know, like, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2984.4s)]
*  and then your response to that is to come in and just counter signal against [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2988.04s)]
*  anybody who's a conspiracy theorist, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2992.88s)]
*  anybody out there who might be a little sloppy the way they're putting dots [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2995.6800000000003s)]
*  together rather than, you know what I'm saying? Like, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2998.7200000000003s)]
*  there's just something about that that's like, and then not just that, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3001.56s)]
*  but then to like, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3004.12s)]
*  try to shame other people for not also counter signaling them like, Hey, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3005.08s)]
*  motherfucker, it's totally reasonable for me to say, all right, you know what? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3009.44s)]
*  I don't agree with a lot of the conspiracy. As I say on my show, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3012.6s)]
*  sometimes if a conspiracy comes up, I go, yeah, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3015.36s)]
*  I think people are jumping to conclusions there. I don't think that's right. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3017.28s)]
*  People know what I say. I say what my views are, but no, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3020.04s)]
*  I don't have to spend all my time counter signaling when other people who hate [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3023.4s)]
*  the government class, like get it wrong, maybe, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3027.12s)]
*  or go a little bit too far. Cause like I could just, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3030.2000000000003s)]
*  it's totally reasonable for me to say, no, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3033.28s)]
*  I'm going to focus on this criminal regime and my outrage for them. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3035.08s)]
*  And then especially when like, you know, the policy, again, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3038.96s)]
*  the policy that Douglas is advocating is so much more evil than, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3042.84s)]
*  than pushing like one of these conspiracy theories. And of course, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3046.92s)]
*  that's why he doesn't want to actually defend that. All right, guys, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3050.36s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3053.48s)]
*  which is my Patriot supply. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3056.1600000000003s)]
*  You've heard me talk about them before because I trust them when it comes to my [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3057.96s)]
*  family's wellbeing. And I just got word they're doing something they've never [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3061.4s)]
*  done before. Right now, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3064.92s)]
*  you can get the best selling mega three month emergency food kit supply for the [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3066.68s)]
*  same price as the standard kit. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3071.2s)]
*  That's more than $360 of real beef, real chicken, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3073.36s)]
*  farm fresh fruits, vegetables included at no extra cost. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3077.7999999999997s)]
*  Even better. The kit now gives you 2,500 calories a day, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3081.88s)]
*  more than any other emergency food supply I've seen. And let's be honest, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3086.08s)]
*  when things go sideways, you're going to need more than just survival. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3090.48s)]
*  You need strength, you need energy, you need real food. Look, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3093.92s)]
*  this is something that for me personally, after the COVID insanity, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3097.0s)]
*  I will always make sure I have a supply of food. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3101.1600000000003s)]
*  I get it from my Patriot supply. It's a great company. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3104.88s)]
*  Go check out my website, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3108.56s)]
*  prepare with smith.com and claim your mega kit while it's this offer lasts. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3109.84s)]
*  That's prepare with smith.com. All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3114.8s)]
*  That's why he'd like to. And look, I will say, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3119.6000000000004s)]
*  I think he in a way made an effort and to the extent that he was successful, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3122.0s)]
*  it's that we only really talked about the war for a pretty short period of time, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3126.7200000000003s)]
*  considering how long the podcast was. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3130.48s)]
*  But when we were talking about that, he didn't land one blow. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3133.2000000000003s)]
*  He didn't take on one point. It was always just this stuff. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3137.76s)]
*  And then the problem is just that his tactics were so transparent, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3141.84s)]
*  that it just seems like people saw through it. It's just, you know, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3145.36s)]
*  it's just, you can't, if you watch this at all with an open mind, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3148.6800000000003s)]
*  you're going to be, and that's why, look, the reality is that I'm getting, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3152.2400000000002s)]
*  like I said, I've been flooded with people saying like, you know, either like, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3157.6400000000003s)]
*  I actually used to really like Douglas Murray. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3162.6400000000003s)]
*  I lost a lot of respect for him on this. I came in neutral, but yeah, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3164.5600000000004s)]
*  he just didn't put up a fight. I got a lot of people who saying, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3168.1600000000003s)]
*  I still disagree with you on the issue, but like, yeah, he really didn't argue, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3170.5600000000004s)]
*  you know, he lost the debate on his bullshit arguments. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3174.6000000000004s)]
*  And I'm sure, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3178.28s)]
*  I'm sure there are some people who are like have their feet planted, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3181.44s)]
*  aren't fans of his and think he won the debate. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3183.8s)]
*  I saw a couple of people posting that. Yeah. He, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3185.48s)]
*  he exposed Dave when he showed that he's never been there or whatever. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3187.6400000000003s)]
*  It's just too dumb, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3191.36s)]
*  but you're not going to see anybody who like was like, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3192.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, I was a huge Dave Smith fan. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3197.96s)]
*  And then this debate changed my mind about that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3199.76s)]
*  So that's kind of how you measure this, these things. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3202.32s)]
*  You try to move the people in the middle. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3204.7200000000003s)]
*  I guess I was able to do a decent job of that. Again, like I said, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3206.44s)]
*  I think he lost a lot more than I won, but that's, I think that's a, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3209.8s)]
*  that's like any other thoughts, Rob or [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3213.88s)]
*  I got one other thought. I might not articulate this in the best way. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3215.84s)]
*  And I don't know, maybe they, maybe it's a, it's a little bit too complicated. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3219.88s)]
*  So I don't want to steal any shine from your brilliant performance. And listen, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3223.48s)]
*  there were very flagrant tricks that he pulled. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3228.32s)]
*  There was the appeal to authority right off the bat. Well, if you're such an [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3230.48s)]
*  expert, why don't we discuss the ideas? There was the, well, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3233.64s)]
*  if you've never seen it, you can't have an opinion. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3236.2799999999997s)]
*  Just to speak to how much nonsense that is. I'm in New York city all the time. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3238.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't see an immigration problem. If I was just going off of what I see, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3241.64s)]
*  I go, there's no immigration problem here, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3244.92s)]
*  but I can then read an article about the costs that it's done to New York city. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3246.96s)]
*  And it's clearly a problem. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3250.48s)]
*  So I actually have better information from what I've read than from what I've [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3251.8799999999997s)]
*  seen. And I mean, that's just one example, but that like, that's just such a, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3254.8399999999997s)]
*  that one's stupid. Also the argument of, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3259.0s)]
*  like selectively picking from government sources, you know, like, I don't know, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3261.92s)]
*  if during COVID the New York times said, Hey, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3266.0s)]
*  the Johnson and Johnson shot is bad. And I go, look, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3268.6800000000003s)]
*  even the New York times is telling you that this one's bad. And you go, Oh, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3271.56s)]
*  what? Suddenly you believe the New York times. No, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3274.04s)]
*  I think the New York times has been showing a narrative the whole time. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3276.2000000000003s)]
*  And when even they're going to concede this point, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3279.28s)]
*  that's when I'm going to go look, that's how flagrant this is. And it, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3281.76s)]
*  so there's a bit of a flip on that one. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3286.0s)]
*  And then there was also just a lot of just wasting time and pulling a little [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3288.7200000000003s)]
*  finicky, Oh, we, we, you know, like that kind of, that kind of stupid thing. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3292.2400000000002s)]
*  There was one other thing that stuck out to me, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3296.2000000000003s)]
*  and maybe you can better articulate this than me, but, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3298.2000000000003s)]
*  I feel like on some of this talk, like some of these topics, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3301.92s)]
*  all that you're really left with, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3304.44s)]
*  because the government does a good job of not leaving a clean track record of [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3305.88s)]
*  its own crimes. Like even look at Pat Fauci post COVID. I said that, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3309.6400000000003s)]
*  I said that I was a recommendation. I was passing this to that. Like, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3314.1600000000003s)]
*  so you take the situation in Syria and what she was trying to make the case that [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3317.6400000000003s)]
*  we weren't involved or that's, you know, why you look at it. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3322.5600000000004s)]
*  It was a smaller factor. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3325.88s)]
*  I can't, I, I, I'm not an expert. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3328.0800000000004s)]
*  I can't point to specific proof of the fact that the United States government [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3330.5600000000004s)]
*  managed to overthrow Assad at the end of the Biden administration. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3334.1600000000003s)]
*  But the fact that there was Ukrainian stuff over there that Israel stepped in, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3337.48s)]
*  took over military bases and the relationship that we've had in the past, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3341.0s)]
*  working with groups such as Al Qaeda in the region, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3345.16s)]
*  while it's saying the moderate rebels. Yeah. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3348.12s)]
*  I can't prove to you that that was America, but I think there's. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3350.44s)]
*  Also at the very least, if you, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3353.64s)]
*  if you arm and back a group and they try to overthrow the government and it [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3355.4s)]
*  fails. And then years later they try to throw the government and it succeeds. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3361.2s)]
*  Even if we don't have the proof yet, which we might well get in the future, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3365.52s)]
*  we'll say that there was direct American involvement in the second time. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3368.8399999999997s)]
*  You still back to the group. The first time, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3373.04s)]
*  like it was still your intervention that ultimately led to this outcome. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3374.84s)]
*  And of course this is the game that they play a lot, but like the whole point, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3378.92s)]
*  as like everybody who studies this shit knows, right? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3383.6s)]
*  The whole game of CIA backed coups is always to like move the needle enough with [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3386.12s)]
*  as little a footprint as necessary. Right? So like, maybe there's a, um, uh, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3394.0s)]
*  an uprising, but the government is stronger and could put it down. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3398.6s)]
*  But like, if you send some weapons in, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3401.44s)]
*  that'll be the difference between them taking over the government or not. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3403.64s)]
*  And then you could sit back and go, Oh, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3407.44s)]
*  it was just a little bit of weapons that we sent in. And it's like, yeah, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3409.04s)]
*  but the point of sending it in is to make the difference. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3411.32s)]
*  That's the whole game. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3413.8s)]
*  State it a little bit differently. And I'll bring, I'll give another example. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3414.96s)]
*  If we can only trust the expert class and we can only criticize government, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3418.28s)]
*  if there's direct government evidence, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3422.84s)]
*  how do you ever question government policy or if it's in our interest? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3424.6s)]
*  And so another example would be, uh, there was a long discussion about, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3430.0s)]
*  you know, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3434.3199999999997s)]
*  Israel's tactics in terms of what it's been doing in Gaza. And you know, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3435.24s)]
*  I've said it a lot. I actually don't know the history of the situation, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3440.36s)]
*  but I look at what's going on there and I just don't think you can kill [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3443.48s)]
*  civilians in the way that the Israeli government has been doing so. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3446.72s)]
*  And so he's trying to walk the line of, well, although they're doing it, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3450.52s)]
*  they don't intend to do it. And now all insert conjecture. Once again, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3454.56s)]
*  I've heard of programs like daddy's home, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3458.68s)]
*  which they're waiting until someone goes back into a building. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3461.08s)]
*  I'm looking at all these homes being bombed. And then he wants to say, well, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3464.3599999999997s)]
*  that's because the booby traps after the fact. Well, I've even read stories of, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3467.6s)]
*  uh, and once again, conjecture, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3471.0s)]
*  I've read stories of the Israeli government sending Palestinians in to set off [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3473.16s)]
*  the booby trap. I don't know if that's true or not, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3477.52s)]
*  but I've certainly just seen the Israeli government lie about, oh, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3479.56s)]
*  the hospitals are named based. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3482.56s)]
*  It was a, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3483.8399999999997s)]
*  it was a herets piece where they spoke to a couple of different IDF, uh, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3484.52s)]
*  you know, soldiers. So it's, you know, again, like you, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3488.88s)]
*  you never know for sure with these things, but it seems like a pretty, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3491.44s)]
*  like just to take it as a given with all the death that's happened in the [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3494.36s)]
*  area at the beginning of the war. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3499.2400000000002s)]
*  I just remember this example where they bombed that first hospital and they said [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3500.84s)]
*  it was a main base and they were pointing to the tunnels. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3503.72s)]
*  And then it turned out that Israel had the tunnels. And then when they said, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3505.6s)]
*  look at the military gear, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3508.32s)]
*  it was less than I've seen in police raids in New York city on gangs. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3509.44s)]
*  So like there might've been a presence there, but to say it was the main base. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3512.7200000000003s)]
*  And then to just say, well, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3515.64s)]
*  I should just give it as an absolute given that, um, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3516.56s)]
*  that Israel's working in a very moral capacity. So sure. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3518.92s)]
*  I'm working off conjecture when I go firstly, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3522.7200000000003s)]
*  I think that this death is outrageous. And yes, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3525.08s)]
*  I also just can kind of deduce, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3527.56s)]
*  I think they're lying about the morality that they're handling it in the most [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3529.08s)]
*  honest. And firstly, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3533.04s)]
*  just telling someone that they can't be in their home and then just sending them [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3534.2000000000003s)]
*  off with no resources to return to empty rubble. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3538.08s)]
*  Like I don't even think that's acceptable, but there seems to be like, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3541.96s)]
*  how do you criticize anything if the government works with the expert class [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3546.28s)]
*  and you need an expert class and then government doesn't keep perfect records of [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3550.52s)]
*  its crime. So at some point you have to kind of evaluate the conjecture of the [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3554.76s)]
*  situation. And so if you're, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3557.88s)]
*  and then if you're just going to label that as conspiracy, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3559.68s)]
*  which I would just say it's more just critical thinking, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3562.48s)]
*  then how do you possibly criticize government from his perspective? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3565.36s)]
*  Yeah. It's, um, you know, look, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3569.12s)]
*  the argument obviously is ridiculous, but it's, it's essentially, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3571.16s)]
*  he just tried to bring the Sam Harris argument there, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3574.2s)]
*  that scoff and say, no, we're, we're above you. We're smarter than you. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3577.3999999999996s)]
*  We're better than you will be the ones who decide. And it's just like, uh, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3582.56s)]
*  you know, look, this is obviously the, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3586.3599999999997s)]
*  the argument is elitist and I think wrong. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3588.64s)]
*  It's also just been widely rejected and it's a, you know, to take that, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3591.3199999999997s)]
*  that ridiculous argument to like the Joe Rogan podcast audience, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3596.0s)]
*  just seemed so crazy to me. It's almost like, you know, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3601.04s)]
*  we disagree on so much. Like if you take the broader, like, uh, um, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3604.6800000000003s)]
*  say Joe Rogan's entire audience, you're talking, you know, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3608.88s)]
*  millions and millions and millions of people, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3611.92s)]
*  or they're different points of view on a lot of different things. You know, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3614.6000000000004s)]
*  there's a lot of different people who are Democrats and Republicans. There are, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3618.7200000000003s)]
*  there are people who are liberals and conservatives. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3622.2000000000003s)]
*  There are people who actually have probably like wildly left wing views and [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3624.48s)]
*  wildly right wing views who listened to Joe Rogan's podcast. But like, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3628.6s)]
*  if there's one thing I feel like that there's just like consensus on is that we [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3633.4s)]
*  don't believe that, you know, we're not here cause like, Oh, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3639.6s)]
*  only the expert class gets to talk about issues. That's the whole, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3643.12s)]
*  like concept of the show is like people, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3646.68s)]
*  interesting people having interesting conversations. So, uh, yeah, anyway, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3649.4s)]
*  it was a quite an exhausting, uh, trip. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3654.72s)]
*  Um, it's been quite a run. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3658.6s)]
*  I think I got a week in a comedy festival in the span of about five days. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3662.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And a fun weekend in, uh, in Boston right before that too. So I got, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3667.12s)]
*  I think I got a week off now, um, but I'm gonna enjoy it. So I'm going to go, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3670.92s)]
*  uh, get some rest. Thank you guys very much for tuning in and, uh, we will, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3675.64s)]
*  we'll be back to normal schedule coming next week. Sorry about the schedule has [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3680.88s)]
*  been a little inconsistent with the podcast, but you know, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3684.92s)]
*  I've been all over the place. So it's, there's only one May. All right. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3687.12s)]
*  Thanks guys. Catch you next time. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3691.7599999999998s)]
