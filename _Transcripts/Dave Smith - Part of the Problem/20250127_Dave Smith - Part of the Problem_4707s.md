**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ)
*  Hello, hello, what's up everybody? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=9.84s)]
*  My headphones weren't plugged in all the way. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=12.8s)]
*  That was the issue there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  What's up? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  I'm joined by Robbie the Fireburnstein. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=16.2s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=17.2s)]
*  I feel like I didn't get the full inshore experience. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=18.2s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Sometimes that's good for you, though. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  It leaves you desiring more, wanting more, which is what I always try to do. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=23.78s)]
*  We... [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=28.04s)]
*  Kentucky. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  That's right, we're going to Louisville. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  I wish it was the opposite order, because you can't get hammered on the Thursday nights, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  because then you're chasing hangovers all weekend. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=35.64s)]
*  You don't want to... [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=38.84s)]
*  I think we have a three hour car ride together after it, so the next day that is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=39.84s)]
*  Maybe you can get hammered, you'll be fine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=43.64s)]
*  Louisville, Kentucky, this Thursday night. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=45.44s)]
*  I like saving it for the last night, but I'm excited to be in Louisville. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=48.04s)]
*  Excited for... [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=52.72s)]
*  I think I've been told it's Louisville. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=53.72s)]
*  Louisville. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=54.72s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=55.72s)]
*  But these towns got to get their shit together. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=56.8s)]
*  You know, work on names that are more pronounced, like the letters. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=58.6s)]
*  I got to go back to kindergarten. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=64.0s)]
*  It's one of the two things. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=65.48s)]
*  Listen, I'm learning how to say city names by touring the country. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=66.48s)]
*  I always learn it by the time we're there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=71.08s)]
*  By the time we're there and I'm on stage, I get it right. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=73.8s)]
*  Louisville? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=75.84s)]
*  It's not Louisville? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=76.84s)]
*  Louisville. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=77.84s)]
*  Louisville? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=78.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=79.84s)]
*  I could be completely wrong. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=80.84s)]
*  Maybe you're right. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=81.84s)]
*  And then Fort Wayne, Indiana, this Friday and Saturday. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=83.84s)]
*  Comic DaveSmith.com for those ticket links. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Of course, as I mentioned to you before, I'm also debating Josh Hammer at Princeton University. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=91.36s)]
*  Ever heard of it? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Bad sign for the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  But debating him on the US-Israel relationship and its influence on American foreign policy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=103.36s)]
*  So that's on February 11th. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=110.0s)]
*  I believe there are still some tickets available for that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=111.52000000000001s)]

*  I'll tweet about it again. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=115.76s)]
*  I'll tweet out the link later tonight. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=117.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=119.36s)]
*  So and then of course, ComicDaveSmith.com. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=120.36s)]
*  I think I said that right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=122.28s)]
*  And of course, PartOfTheProblem.com. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=123.28s)]
*  If you want to support our podcast and become part of the live chat and get the members [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=125.0s)]

*  PartOfTheProblem.com. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=132.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=133.28s)]
*  So there is. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=136.0s)]
*  Look, there's a lot going on in the world and we're going to have a busy week with lots [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=139.48s)]
*  of topics to discuss. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  I did want to respond today to a podcast that called me out, not by name. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=145.4s)]
*  They went the Ben Shapiro route. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=154.96s)]
*  They won't state your name. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=156.4s)]
*  They don't want to give you the press. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=157.4s)]
*  I understand. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=159.04s)]
*  But I just I listen. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=160.12s)]
*  Lord Voldemort over here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=161.6s)]
*  Well, look, I just have to treat me like Voldemort. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=162.6s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=167.2s)]
*  I am only spending today's episode on this top. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=168.8s)]
*  Only 10 percent of it is my ego. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, OK, there's 90 percent a reason why it's worth responding to this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=174.0s)]
*  It's an honor tradition that no matter how small the platform calls out on Twitter, we [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=178.84s)]
*  have to dedicate full episodes to it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=182.4s)]
*  I just the part of the problem way. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  Listen, there has to be a punishment for refusing to say my name. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=186.4s)]
*  OK, say my name when you call me out. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=191.28s)]
*  And if you do, I will decide whether or not to retaliate. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=194.0s)]
*  If you do this shit, then I'm going to. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Patty grievances with Dave Smith. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=201.16s)]
*  There you go. That could be the podcast. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=202.88s)]
*  Well, look, I will. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=204.88s)]
*  So for people who don't know, if people follow me on Twitter, they may have seen I posted [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=205.88s)]
*  a couple of times about this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  But for those of you who don't know what we're talking about here, this was on Jonah Goldberg's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  podcast. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=217.28s)]
*  Now, he wouldn't be Jewish by chance. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=218.28s)]
*  I name like that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=220.28s)]
*  It's not I'm not pro-Israel kind of guy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  Impossible to say, Rob. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=225.32s)]
*  Impossible to determine one way or the other. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=227.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  But this is, you know, ironically, I guess, given our back and forth, I've actually as [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  I was posting about this on Twitter and as we discuss it here on the podcast, I've had [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=238.44s)]
*  to explain who Jonah Goldberg is to a lot of people, because the truth is he's kind [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=241.84s)]
*  of I never heard of him. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, and it's understandable. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  It would be understandable that most people paying attention today have not heard of this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=251.16s)]
*  guy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=255.04s)]
*  But I'm just a little bit older and, you know, I'm obsessed with this shit. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  So I know exactly who Jonah Goldberg is. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=261.88s)]
*  Jonah Goldberg was the editor at National Review, which National Review, of course, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=263.84s)]
*  was for the at least the second half of the 20th century, probably the, you know, gold [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  standard of a conservative publication, debatably the most influential conservative publication. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=278.88s)]
*  Jonah Goldberg was a young star in this world. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, in neoconservative circles, let's say he was really I mean, he must have [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  been, you know, he's got to be about 15 years older than me. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=299.4s)]
*  So something in that ballpark. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  But so this would put him I mean, he was the editor of National Review. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=305.52s)]
*  In 2002. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=308.8s)]
*  So if he's 15 years, I mean, I'm not I don't know exactly his birthday, but this would [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=309.8s)]
*  put him at around 30 maybe. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=315.48s)]
*  So imagine like he was like really a big shot at that time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=318.32s)]
*  And I remember many years. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=322.64s)]
*  I mean, I remember reading his weekly columns in National Review and seeing him on all types [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=324.04s)]
*  of TV shows. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  He was always on the Fox News All-Star panel and this stuff and, you know, advocating all [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  of the disastrous policies that ruin the 21st century. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=335.52s)]
*  So he's got this guy Moynihan on his podcast and they you know, the topic of me and Scott [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=339.88s)]
*  Horton and Darrell Cooper and some of these guys came up now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=348.96s)]
*  Michael Moynihan is he's the fifth column podcast guy. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  So he's I thought he worked for Reason at one point. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  I could be getting that wrong, but he worked for Vice News and the Daily Beast and he did [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=362.2s)]
*  a podcast with some well, who it would have been. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  I think Camille Foster was part of the podcast for a while. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=372.4s)]
*  And Matt Welsh, I believe, was as well. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure who's currently on the podcast. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  But anyway, as tends to happen with these things, I get you know, they were talking [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  about some me and some people in our camp. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=386.08s)]
*  And then, you know, people on social media send it to me and I did end up listening to it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=390.0s)]
*  And it's look, it's kind of fascinating to me because again, I remember being, you know, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=393.2s)]
*  whatever. I was 20 when he was 30 or 35 or whatever. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  And he was the, you know, the editor at National Review. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=406.08s)]
*  And I remember, you know, hating him then because he was wrong about everything and awful. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=408.88s)]
*  And now it's just it's a it's a little bit of a surreal thing when, you know, they're like trash and me. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=413.67999999999995s)]
*  But also, I just thought it was it was almost like a perfect microcosm of like the old dying media, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=419.24s)]
*  giving their feelings about people in this new media and their own. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=426.48s)]
*  I mean, look, I I don't want to like poison the well. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=431.76s)]
*  So I guess we could just jump in and kind of dissect it a little bit. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, I'll save my thought until you guys hear it and you can tell that I'm not just just inventing this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  This is how these guys are. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  So let's let's start the podcast and then we can obviously we'll we'll stop a bunch and give our our thoughts on it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=447.16s)]
*  So this is from Jonah Goldberg's. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=454.72s)]
*  The podcast is the really give them a plug here on the bigger platform. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Well, listen, these guys are they're kind of like you ever see those commercials, Rob, where it's like on Fox News, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  they'll have the commercials where like you can send a box of Jewish goodies to a Holocaust survivor somewhere in the world. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=468.72s)]
*  I never saw. Is that a real thing? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=475.8s)]
*  Yeah. These people are without and it's our job to help them. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=477.12s)]
*  So let's get some some eyeballs on Jonah Goldberg's podcast. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=480.88s)]
*  Like potato skins for them to open up and go, I haven't seen this in years. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=484.32s)]
*  I guess. OK, the show is called The Remnant. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  That is, which is a reference that I'm quite fond of. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=490.76s)]
*  Back to my childhood in camps. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  All right. Come on, Jonah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=496.36s)]
*  There's just a bunch of Jews here joking around. All right. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=499.44s)]
*  We can all have fun together. All right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=501.36s)]
*  Let's let's dive into this and discuss. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=502.92s)]
*  Defending East Germany, you know, this thing like what Soviet nostalgia gets right. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=507.08s)]
*  It's like, excuse me. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=511.4s)]
*  And I think so much of that comes from foreign policy, actually, because I mean, so Rob was a very dedicated neocon. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=513.24s)]
*  He was a very. It should be 55 minutes is where we want to start. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=519.72s)]
*  And 55, 11. OK, yeah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=523.96s)]
*  Maybe I was maybe I was wrong about that. Sure. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=527.4s)]
*  No, no, no, no, I thought it should be right there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=529.76s)]
*  But hold on one second. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=532.0s)]
*  Yeah. OK, just just play it. That's change in Iran where he I think he was either born or his parents. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=535.08s)]
*  He might actually have been born in Iran. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=540.84s)]
*  And he and he is from the right one. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=542.56s)]
*  I'm guilty, actually. Libertarians. OK. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=545.28s)]
*  There's a completely baddie school of libertarians who seem to have taken over the kind of mantle of libertarianism. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=548.36s)]
*  You see this comedian guy who's always a camera's name is always talking on Twitter and they never talk about economics. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  I've never heard them talk about it. OK, let's let's pause it right here. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=561.68s)]
*  You know, not so. Look. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  What can you say about this? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=568.88s)]
*  First of all, I understand there there's this comedian guy who's kind of taken over the libertarian mantle. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=571.16s)]
*  Who else are we talking about here? OK, so this is clearly a shot at me. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=579.72s)]
*  What these guys do and this is again, it's just it's these kind of. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=585.52s)]
*  It's these tactics from the old order that somehow they think are still going to work. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=594.12s)]
*  It's that hey, like we're above that, so they don't even want to pretend that they know my name. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=601.16s)]
*  Like, it's just this comedian guy. I don't even remember his name. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=607.6s)]
*  You know, like, first of all, I know it's a difficult name to pronounce. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=611.4s)]
*  I understand it's a difficult one to memorize, but this is an act. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=616.32s)]
*  Moinem knows my name. He could just say it if you want. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=621.16s)]
*  If you want to spend the time criticizing me on the podcast, well, then just say it and do it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=624.48s)]
*  Because think about this while while you guys think with I was going to say before, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=630.88s)]
*  but I said I didn't want to poison the well, but it's like you'll see through this whole thing. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=636.28s)]
*  It's just this pure like snob routine that they do like just just constantly letting you know, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=639.32s)]
*  and they're not even good at it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=646.12s)]
*  So they're like, I'll just tell you that I'm better than you. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=647.2s)]
*  Whereas like you're supposed to kind of demonstrate that not just assert it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  But think about while you're trying to play this game of pretending you can't remember the name Dave. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=654.8s)]
*  Think about how stupid what you're saying is. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  Imagine. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=664.24s)]
*  Saying you can't remember someone's name and then criticizing them for what they don't discuss. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=666.72s)]
*  Just think about how stupid that is like you're telling me that if you can't remember the name Dave, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=674.24s)]
*  you don't know enough about me to remember the name Dave Smith. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=681.12s)]
*  Yet, you know what I not only what I do talk about, right? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=684.9200000000001s)]
*  Because you have to have a lot more familiarity with someone to criticize them for what they don't talk about, right? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=688.88s)]
*  Like I could not be familiar with someone at all and see him say one thing and then I could criticize them for what they said. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=694.52s)]
*  But in order for me to criticize someone for not discussing something like avoiding a topic, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=700.84s)]
*  I'd have to actually follow their work, right? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=706.52s)]
*  Because that would be pretty stupid. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=708.84s)]
*  Like if I were if somebody were to, let's say, tweet about tax policy and then my criticism of them was I go, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=711.0s)]
*  I don't know anything about this guy. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=721.12s)]
*  I'm not sure what his name is, but my criticism of him is that he never discusses monetary policy. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=722.32s)]
*  Well, how would I know that unless I was somewhat familiar with the guy? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=727.48s)]
*  And then he could turn around and be like, I wrote three books on monetary policy. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=731.64s)]
*  And I'd be like, oh, I feel like a retard because I just criticize someone whose name I don't know [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=734.76s)]
*  for what they don't discuss. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=740.64s)]
*  And again, a good way to avoid looking really, really stupid like that is to like not do this, not criticize someone for what they do. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=742.6s)]
*  And again, Moynihan, sorry, this is just a stupid criticism. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=752.68s)]
*  I talk about economics constantly. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  My faction in the Libertarian Party is the Mises Caucus named after Ludwig von Mises, the Austrian economist. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=758.56s)]
*  We talk about economics constantly. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=766.96s)]
*  Too much, some might say. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=770.1199999999999s)]
*  But anyway, what can you even say about that other than like this is just this is silly on its face. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=771.9599999999999s)]
*  And again, the reason there's a thing here and I'll get into this more with these guys, but there's a thing here where. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=778.7199999999999s)]
*  It's just. I don't know exactly how to say it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=788.5999999999999s)]
*  There's a reason why me and you would not make that type of mistake. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=792.4399999999999s)]
*  There'd be no time that we'd criticize someone, pretend we don't know their name and then claim they don't talk about something which they talk about all the time. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  And the reason why is like. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=804.8399999999999s)]
*  Because we'd we'd look like idiots if we did that, right? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=808.72s)]
*  And we are in the marketplace here. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=812.92s)]
*  You can't we can't just be retarded because then like we'll lose our support. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=815.92s)]
*  You know, people come in here and they watch the show because they count on us to not be retards. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=821.64s)]
*  You know, like I'm not saying we're the most brilliant things in the world, but like we at least the expectations when you talk about something, you kind of know what you're talking about. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  You kind of know a little something about it and we would guard against talking about something that we don't know about at all. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=834.28s)]
*  The old school guys, the guys from the old order, they don't have any of that because they weren't in a real competitive market. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=842.52s)]
*  They were at the National Review where what are you going to do? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=850.16s)]
*  You compete with the National Review. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=853.52s)]
*  The National Review already made it so you can't compete with the National Review. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=854.72s)]
*  They're like in they've been knighted in this circle. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=858.0s)]
*  And so they would when they were talking about back in the day, let's say if they were talking about Ron Paul or Pat Buchanan or anyone who they had like exercised from the conservative movement, they could just say whatever they want because you never get to hear from that guy. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=860.6s)]
*  But that's not the world we live in now. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=873.52s)]
*  You can't just say whatever you want about me because I have a bigger platform than you do. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=875.68s)]
*  Now, Jonah Goldberg, I tweeted something about this. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=879.8s)]
*  It's actually a pretty funny exchange. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=882.24s)]
*  I tweeted something about this, like just on the level of like how dumb is it to claim you can't remember my name, but you can criticize me for what I do and don't discuss. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=883.64s)]
*  Right. Pretty straightforward. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=892.8s)]
*  Stupid. And so I said this and Jonah Goldberg, he he responded to me. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=894.24s)]
*  So let me make sure I get this right. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=902.44s)]
*  So I give him what he said. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=905.52s)]
*  So he responded by saying, I have so little idea of who you are. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=908.24s)]
*  I don't even remember talking about you. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=914.8s)]
*  Sorry, dude. Didn't mean it as an insult. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=917.32s)]
*  Still don't. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=920.0s)]
*  And this is what I'm saying. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=921.92s)]
*  You just the pure snobbery of these guys as if they're superior to everybody because you fucking sold the war in Iraq 20 something years ago. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=924.4s)]
*  Your one claim to fame is the most disastrous foreign policy blunder in modern American history. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=934.88s)]
*  And yet you have a sense of superiority. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=941.84s)]
*  Now, as soon as he says that, it's so funny because he tweets this and then everybody on Twitter is just responding. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=945.12s)]
*  They're like, hey, dude, you know, Twitter has this really cool function where you can see how many followers everybody has. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=951.52s)]
*  And so, by the way, I'm not saying if you don't know who I am, that's fine. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  Don't know who I am. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=962.2800000000001s)]
*  Lots of people don't know who I am. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=963.16s)]
*  I don't know who lots of other people are. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=964.8s)]
*  I'm sure there's lots of people who have way bigger followings than me. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=966.68s)]
*  And I don't know who they are. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=970.16s)]
*  Right. But what I would never do, what you'll never see me do on this show is address somebody with a much bigger following than me, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=971.44s)]
*  criticize them for what they don't talk about. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=980.08s)]
*  OK, which is something they do talk about all the time. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=983.64s)]
*  And then when they call me out on that go, dude, I don't even know who you are. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=986.6s)]
*  But what's that supposed to mean? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=991.28s)]
*  Anyway, in this new world, unlike the old world, you have to be prepared to actually argue against those people. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=993.64s)]
*  You don't get to just slander Ron Paul with whatever you want. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1001.3199999999999s)]
*  And then people don't get to hear from them. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1004.52s)]
*  And in fact, as I said to you before, Rob, as like we have a much bigger platform than them. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1006.64s)]
*  And so it just. It's like, you know, my my three year old, he has like one of those, you know, like the little hammers that kids have that are like squishy at the end that make like a little honk noise when you hit them. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1013.12s)]
*  It's like if you had that little hammer and someone else has a sledgehammer and then you just hit them with your little clown hammer. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1026.88s)]
*  I'm the guy with the sledgehammer. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1035.44s)]
*  So now I'm just sitting here looking at this sledgehammer in my hand going like, oh, well, if you want to get into a game of hitting people with hammer, like if you want to get into a game of shitting on each other on our podcasts, I'll just do that to way more people than you do it to. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1037.4s)]
*  I don't know what to say. It's just the whole thing is is very bizarre to me. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1054.0800000000002s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is, of course, Crowd Health. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1058.24s)]
*  We've been telling you about this company for years because they really are that amazing. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1062.68s)]
*  If anybody here is not thrilled with their health insurance carrier, which is pretty much 100 percent of people, you got to check out Crowd Health. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1066.64s)]
*  It is a decentralized health care payment system that frees you from the tyranny of health insurance. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1074.68s)]
*  So in other words, this is not health insurance. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1080.1200000000001s)]
*  It's an alternative to health insurance where you can see whatever doctors you like because there's no networks limiting you. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1082.68s)]
*  It's significantly less expensive than health insurance. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1088.48s)]
*  They rip out the middleman with all the bureaucracy. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1091.4s)]
*  And a lot of people say this is a huge portion of the costs of health insurance. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1094.1200000000001s)]
*  Singles are about one hundred and eighty five dollars a month. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1098.6000000000001s)]
*  A family of four is six hundred and five dollars a month. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1101.44s)]
*  And you can use the promo code POTP and get only ninety nine dollars a month per person for the next three months. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1104.92s)]
*  Again, Crowd Health is not health insurance. It's a totally different way of paying for health care. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1112.4s)]
*  Terms and conditions may apply. Check them out at Join Crowd Health dot com. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1117.28s)]
*  An unbelievable company and a really great alternative to the broken health insurance system. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1122.04s)]
*  All right. Let's get back into the show. I don't know, Rob, any thoughts? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1127.12s)]
*  Well, you know, this is our first time discussing it. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1130.92s)]
*  You sent the episode my way this morning and I gave it a listen when I was preparing. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1133.92s)]
*  And it's funny that you call them snobbery because the word I had in my head was that it's just very bitchy behavior. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1139.32s)]
*  And the two the two moves, it's one criticizing us of, oh, you're libertarian. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1145.1599999999999s)]
*  So then you guys should be talking about economics, which for one we do. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1150.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, that's about to come up. Oh, yeah, I guess that came up already. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1153.0s)]
*  We do. And then the second one, which I, you know, I'll talk more on this later once we hear it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1155.4799999999998s)]
*  But I've experienced this a lot of times in contracts where someone will put something in a contract and you go, well, I take issue with that. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1160.2399999999998s)]
*  And they go, well, it's not important, but we have to keep it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1166.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's our entire argument about you guys shouldn't be focused on the foreign policy. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1171.08s)]
*  It's not important, but it should be exactly the way that we lay it out. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1176.12s)]
*  Well, then it's important. And then that means we should discuss it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1179.2s)]
*  But it's kind of like this bitchy move of like, no, it just should be my way. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1182.44s)]
*  Let's just have it my way. Don't even discuss it. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1185.84s)]
*  You guys should be going to talk about this other thing. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1187.96s)]
*  You're like, well, why can't we discuss it? You're not supposed to. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1190.0s)]
*  It's not your thing. Yeah, it's not that important. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1192.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's just take it right out of the contract. And now it's really not important. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1194.24s)]
*  Right. So not important that we never have to think about it again. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1197.36s)]
*  Yeah, I get the comparison. All right. Let's let's keep playing. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1200.32s)]
*  Even an issue. It's all about foreign policy. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1205.0s)]
*  It's all about Israel. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1208.2s)]
*  They're literally more interesting in having conversations about how bad Churchill was [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1209.44s)]
*  than they are about, you know, our trade barriers. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1215.6399999999999s)]
*  Net positive for the American worker. Right. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1218.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, these are interesting conversations that I think they're actually really like. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1220.92s)]
*  What a like thing about the again, the just bitch behavior is a good way to put it. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1225.2s)]
*  Just condescending snobbery. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1230.36s)]
*  Oh, you'll decide what are the interesting conversations like. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1232.52s)]
*  By the way, are trade barriers good for the economy? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1236.3999999999999s)]
*  Is an interesting conversation. I'm not downplaying that. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1239.8799999999999s)]
*  These are the listen. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1243.8s)]
*  We're all policy nerds here. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1245.12s)]
*  Us and them. Right. Like this is what we all do. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1247.28s)]
*  Yes, that's the type of thing I would read an article about. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1252.04s)]
*  I would listen to a podcast about like I do find that to be an interesting conversation. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1255.12s)]
*  Are you saying that Israel or World War Two are not interesting conversations? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1259.24s)]
*  Are those not like as if it's like that? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1264.76s)]
*  And I'll tell you, this also is of the old order. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1267.68s)]
*  Is that this is, by the way, this was a big part of the beef that Murray Rothbard [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1272.12s)]
*  had with National Review. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1276.04s)]
*  And when the hardcore libertarians kind of got purged out of that movement [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1277.48s)]
*  was that they wanted Murray Rothbard to just like write articles about the minimum wage. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1281.52s)]
*  And he was like, no, I want to write about the war in Vietnam, you know, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1286.48s)]
*  and like they'd be like, well, libertarians should be like economic specialists over here. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  And he was like, no, I don't agree to that at all. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1293.8000000000002s)]
*  And that's that's what they always wanted libertarians to be. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1295.76s)]
*  But like the thing is, first of all, the war in Israel is not separate. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1298.48s)]
*  The war in Gaza or whatever is not separate from economics. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1304.44s)]
*  There's an economic component to that war as well. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1307.76s)]
*  And the fact is that our relationship with Israel has been. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1310.5600000000002s)]
*  Let's say a large piece of the puzzle of why we fought the war in Iraq [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1314.84s)]
*  and why we fought the war in Libya and Syria and Yemen and, you know, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1320.84s)]
*  like all of these conflicts are all very interrelated. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1325.36s)]
*  And this has cost trillions and trillions of dollars. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1329.1999999999998s)]
*  So it's not as if this conversation is separate from the from a discussion [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1333.32s)]
*  about economics and the economics of it are actually very important. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1339.24s)]
*  But just the idea that you get to come up here and say, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1342.44s)]
*  now, this is an interesting conversation, but you guys want to talk about this, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1346.68s)]
*  which is not interesting. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1351.0s)]
*  Who defy? Listen, I mean, objectively speaking, they're all interesting topics. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1352.72s)]
*  Like there's interesting conversations to have with all of them. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1358.3600000000001s)]
*  But who the fuck are you, Moynihan, to decide what's interesting and what's not? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, again, these conversations are things that get many more eyeballs on them [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1367.64s)]
*  than anything you ever do. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1372.88s)]
*  So people are interested in these conversations. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1375.24s)]
*  You don't just get to come in anymore. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1379.0400000000002s)]
*  This isn't how it works. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1381.0400000000002s)]
*  You don't get to just come in anymore and go, no, no, no, we've determined [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1382.44s)]
*  what is interesting. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1386.24s)]
*  And these are the parameters of what you're allowed to discuss. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1388.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, look, for libertarians, people who believe in liberty, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1391.64s)]
*  I mean, what could be more important than the topic of war? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1394.84s)]
*  You know, the ultimate infraction on liberty would be dropping bombs [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1399.24s)]
*  on cities full of people. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1407.04s)]
*  It's even more tyrannical than top marginal tax rates being too high, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1408.84s)]
*  as I'm sure Jonah Goldberg would like to limit the discussion to. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1416.6399999999999s)]
*  Sorry, we want to talk about the war. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1420.4399999999998s)]
*  Sorry, we want to talk about the war. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1422.44s)]
*  And oh, by the way, Jonah Goldberg also wanted to talk about the war [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1424.64s)]
*  back when he was helping to sell the war in Iraq. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1427.64s)]
*  He probably doesn't want to talk about that anymore. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1430.64s)]
*  Jonah Goldberg probably doesn't want me to read from Jonah Goldberg pieces [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1432.84s)]
*  from 2002. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1435.84s)]
*  He'd probably rather those fell apart, or those faded into the, you know, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1436.84s)]
*  the distant past, and we forget about that. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1442.44s)]
*  But if anybody wants to, they're still on the internet. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1444.64s)]
*  So he was fine to talk about war when he was selling the catastrophe. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1448.04s)]
*  But oh, those of us who want to avoid the next catastrophe, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1452.84s)]
*  we should really just shut up and talk about tariff policy or something [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1456.4399999999998s)]
*  like that. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1460.84s)]
*  I also think war is one of the harshest consequences of having a Federal [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1462.1399999999999s)]
*  Reserve, which is a big economic topic that we'll talk about. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1466.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1470.04s)]
*  Is that instead of having to tax people and sell support, sell war bonds, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1470.54s)]
*  get people to support a war. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1475.4399999999998s)]
*  You just get to rob them through inflation and you get to have wars [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1477.04s)]
*  without the support of the American people. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1480.74s)]
*  And if you want to have a war with Russia, you can, you know, you can [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1483.04s)]
*  even have that billionaire, you know, talk about how it's cheaper [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1486.4399999999998s)]
*  because you got Ukrainian lives are going to be lost because Americans [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1491.74s)]
*  won't actually go and fight these foreign wars anymore. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1494.84s)]
*  Yeah, the guy that got the medal from Biden. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1497.84s)]
*  I forget his name, the currency dude. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1501.34s)]
*  I know. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1502.6399999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1503.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1503.4399999999998s)]
*  Names. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1504.04s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, also, I will just say that I, you know, you guys, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1505.24s)]
*  the listeners, you may remember this better than me, but it was either [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1510.54s)]
*  one podcast or two podcasts ago that we had a whole discussion about [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1513.84s)]
*  tariffs and their effect on the consumers and how you can't really [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1519.44s)]
*  tax your way into prosperity and it's just going to make goods more [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1523.04s)]
*  expensive. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1525.6399999999999s)]
*  We can't really tax foreign countries. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1526.44s)]
*  We can only tax the goods that Americans are consuming. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1528.54s)]
*  It's like we do talk about this stuff. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1531.74s)]
*  Again, it's all right. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1534.1399999999999s)]
*  Let's let's keep going. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1535.54s)]
*  Real conversations to be had. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1538.44s)]
*  I mean, David Otter at MIT wrote that thing about a problem with [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1540.84s)]
*  free trade and what, you know, the opening of China has done to [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1546.34s)]
*  the blah blah blah, you know, that's an interesting conversation to [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1549.24s)]
*  have. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1552.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, people like Russ Roberts who were smart to have a Scotland [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1552.54s)]
*  sick him who's brilliant on this stuff and that's like, I love reading [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1555.94s)]
*  about that. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1559.44s)]
*  They've just completely abandoned it and it is their motivation for [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1559.74s)]
*  everything is foreign policy. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1563.74s)]
*  The thing about Tucker that I've noticed he said it, I think once [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1566.74s)]
*  directly, but he said it a number of times and I know exactly who [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1570.04s)]
*  he's talking about. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1573.94s)]
*  He says like, you know, these people who I used to scorn because [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1574.94s)]
*  as a conservative I was supposed to and he's talking about no [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1578.84s)]
*  chomsky and he's done a bunch of these things about John Greenwald [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1581.04s)]
*  to I mean, he was he used to tell me like I'm agreeing more and [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1584.14s)]
*  more going through. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1588.14s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1588.74s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's just out in the open. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1589.44s)]
*  It's just that in the open. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1592.44s)]
*  They do these like two-hour love fest together and but that kind [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1593.44s)]
*  of thing. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1596.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean it all is it for a second here, but is it isn't it interesting [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1597.3400000000001s)]
*  that they literally they go. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1603.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh and now, you know, Tucker Carlson has said in the past that [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1606.24s)]
*  there are these leftists used to scorn. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1609.94s)]
*  He claims he's talking about no chomsky. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1611.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's true or not. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1613.94s)]
*  I hope it's true. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1615.64s)]
*  That would be awesome. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1617.24s)]
*  If Tucker was like I knew he's thinking of Glenn Greenwald when [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1618.24s)]
*  he says that a lot because he's told me that personally but one [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1620.94s)]
*  thing you might notice this is it's unattached to any argument. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1625.24s)]
*  It's just like Tucker's basically going, you know, there were [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1628.94s)]
*  all these people when I was a young conservative who I was just [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1631.24s)]
*  kind of these leftists who I was just taught I'm supposed to [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1633.3400000000001s)]
*  hate these guys and then as I start reading their stuff, I'm [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1635.8400000000001s)]
*  going, you know, they're actually making a lot of sense. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1639.24s)]
*  They make a lot of really good points by the way no chomsky [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1641.64s)]
*  made a lot of really good points about US foreign policy. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1643.94s)]
*  So does Glenn Greenwald like and he's looking at and going oh [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1647.3400000000001s)]
*  actually a lot of the stuff that they were saying was right and [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1650.64s)]
*  then but some number one, you know, if you take someone like [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1653.8400000000001s)]
*  you take chomsky Greenwald guys like this who were real opponents [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1658.44s)]
*  of the war in Iraq and then Tucker's going. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1662.0400000000002s)]
*  Oh, you know, I used to think I was supposed to hate these guys, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1665.3400000000001s)]
*  but now I'm saying they make a lot of sense and Goldberg one of [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1667.44s)]
*  the major people who was selling the war in Iraq. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1670.8400000000001s)]
*  Just go. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1674.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrible. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1675.3400000000001s)]
*  They said but you're not going to address it all. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1677.74s)]
*  Why? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1679.3400000000001s)]
*  Like you're not going to address why you guys lost the moment [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1680.1399999999999s)]
*  why you guys lost the argument because the policy you supported [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1683.54s)]
*  turned out to be an unmitigated disaster literally the biggest [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1687.1399999999999s)]
*  foreign policy blunder in modern American history. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1691.34s)]
*  Like listen, dude, I'm not even there. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1695.04s)]
*  I'll pull it up later. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1697.74s)]
*  Maybe the but then to to you know, make this after going by [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1698.44s)]
*  the way, you know, kind of telling us what are the interesting [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1703.54s)]
*  conversations verse what aren't what people can have these [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1706.24s)]
*  conversations. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1709.24s)]
*  You see these people are smart. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1710.14s)]
*  You can read them. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1711.54s)]
*  They can have this conversation and then just to turn to Tucker [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1712.54s)]
*  and go. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1715.34s)]
*  Oh, but now he loves these leftists and him and Glenn Greenwald [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1715.84s)]
*  just have these two-hour love Fests. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1718.84s)]
*  What what are you two doing right now? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1721.44s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1724.64s)]
*  You're having a podcast talking about things that you both agree [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1725.84s)]
*  with neither of you are disagreeing your book like you're doing [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1728.74s)]
*  the same thing dude. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1732.14s)]
*  So yes, the difference is that Tucker and Glenn Greenwald are [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1733.64s)]
*  right. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1738.14s)]
*  Whereas you guys are wrong. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1739.44s)]
*  The points they're making are very intelligent. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1741.24s)]
*  The ones you guys are making are retarded and a lot more people [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1743.64s)]
*  watch theirs. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1747.84s)]
*  Those are the differences but the love Fest dynamic it's unbelievable [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1749.74s)]
*  because you said like bitchy behavior. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1754.14s)]
*  It is there's like it's this incredible atrophy that was built [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1756.74s)]
*  up by people who were in like an insulated world that weren't [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1762.54s)]
*  exposed to like smart critical thinking people from the outside. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1766.44s)]
*  And so what they resort to is like these it's kind of it's like [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1771.54s)]
*  teenage girl tactics in an argument. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1776.24s)]

*  Yes, Tucker Carlson and Glenn Greenwald do shows together. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1810.3400000000001s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1895.74s)]
*  All right, let's keep lying for me with Trump in that interview [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1897.3400000000001s)]
*  that he did with Bill O'Reilly when Bill O'Reilly said, you [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1901.24s)]
*  know, Putin's a cold-blooded killer and he's like, you know, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1904.04s)]
*  look at our history. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1907.04s)]
*  You've done a lot of bad stuff too. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1907.8400000000001s)]
*  And I was like, wait, what the Republican nominee for president [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1909.64s)]
*  just, you know, said we're pretty bad on the international [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1913.74s)]
*  stage too. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1916.84s)]
*  And it's just been a weird thing particularly ask about this [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1917.84s)]
*  more directly because I've asked a couple people about this [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1921.04s)]
*  a good argument. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1923.04s)]
*  Pause it for a second really took it on took on the idea. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1924.94s)]
*  This is what I mean. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1927.34s)]
*  I mean, doesn't that not by the way, I mean, I just said it [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1928.34s)]
*  does the next sentence not perfectly describe what I'm [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1930.54s)]
*  talking about where it's like teenagers like what are you [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1933.24s)]
*  going to attach this to an argument or no, you're talking [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1937.74s)]
*  to the guy who sold the war in Iraq. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1941.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1944.94s)]
*  Yes, by the way, we have talked about this moment quite a [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1945.74s)]
*  bit. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1948.14s)]
*  It wasn't when Trump was a candidate. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1948.44s)]
*  He was already president of the United States of America. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1950.04s)]
*  It was the Bill O'Reilly halftime of the Super Bowl interview. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1952.34s)]
*  So this is after the presidential election. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1956.24s)]
*  Now if you when again, it's like these old-school guys, it's [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1961.24s)]
*  they just I don't even know how to say this. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1965.64s)]
*  Okay, this is the analogy that I'll give. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1968.64s)]
*  All right, Rob, cuz I think and I think you'll you'll appreciate [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1971.04s)]
*  this maybe not but let's say, okay, so I'm a big I'm a big [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1975.24s)]
*  MMA fan, right? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1979.74s)]
*  Love the UFC when we're out on the road this Saturday night. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1981.64s)]
*  We're going to be in the green room watching the UFC after [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1984.44s)]
*  our show is over because that's what we always do and I've [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1986.94s)]
*  been a fan of the sport for many many years and the first [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1989.54s)]
*  podcast I ever did was a hammer fisting podcast with Lewis me [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1992.74s)]
*  and Natalie actually met our met each other on the now defunct [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1996.14s)]
*  the short-lived yo MMA rap, but anyway, big fan of the sport. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=1999.74s)]
*  So for people who don't know the UFC started in the 90s. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2003.74s)]
*  Now I grew up in the 80s. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2008.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I was born in 83. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2011.24s)]
*  So I you know, I was 10 when the UFC started but I remember [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2012.44s)]
*  when I was a little kid and people around my age will probably [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2015.5400000000002s)]
*  remember this but every town in the United States of America [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2018.24s)]
*  had a dojo. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2023.14s)]
*  They had karate places or taekwondo was really big. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2025.74s)]
*  There was a bit of the like was Bruce Lee's one like Wing [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2031.74s)]
*  Chung or something like that, but there were all these different [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2034.74s)]
*  like Eastern martial arts places and this was the old order. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2037.24s)]
*  Okay, and in this old order that it was always like, you know, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2042.84s)]
*  whoever the guy at your local YMCA who taught taekwondo like [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2048.34s)]
*  I went to taekwondo almost every boy I knew like when we were [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2053.24s)]
*  a seven and eight. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2056.8399999999997s)]
*  This is what everyone did was karate. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2057.74s)]
*  Now this back then every and it was very mystical and the instructors [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2060.8399999999997s)]
*  would always claim these wild things, you know, like I remember [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2066.4399999999996s)]
*  my guy tell him he was a seventh degree black belt in the art [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2069.64s)]
*  of whatever nonsense. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2073.74s)]
*  He was teaching me was and only three men in the world could [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2074.8399999999997s)]
*  kick his ass. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2078.8399999999997s)]
*  He could kick everybody else's ass and he had like this [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2079.74s)]
*  eagle crane punch that would make your heart explode if he [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2083.04s)]
*  hit you like this was real shit that instructors would say to [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2086.84s)]
*  kids. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2089.14s)]
*  However, in the old order you couldn't spar because what are [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2089.74s)]
*  you going to what am I going to do Rob hit you with my eagle [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2094.94s)]
*  crane punch and watch your heart explode. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2097.54s)]
*  Obviously that won't be a fun karate lesson. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2099.34s)]
*  So we can't spar because I'd kill you. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2102.14s)]
*  So we'll just do Katas. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2104.74s)]
*  You know, you just practice the moves and you do it in front [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2106.74s)]
*  of the mirror and then you'll hit the bag and then you'll do [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2109.24s)]
*  this but we don't fight because we'd kill you, you know, and [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2111.74s)]
*  then the UFC came along. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2115.04s)]
*  I'm Jewish. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2116.24s)]
*  We practice pushing nagging nagging at the mirror for a while. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2116.74s)]
*  But so then the UFC came along and this was really pretty [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2122.4399999999996s)]
*  revolutionary at the time. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2126.04s)]
*  Like no one had even thought you could do this, but they were [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2127.3399999999997s)]
*  just like it. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2130.54s)]
*  We're going to have fights with no rules no rules and it was [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2131.14s)]
*  like is that even legal and then it turned out they got a [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2134.24s)]
*  lot of pressure from the government. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2136.8399999999997s)]
*  They actually had to do them on Indian reservations for a while [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2137.8399999999997s)]
*  because they were unregulated and it was illegal to do them [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2140.44s)]
*  anywhere else, but they basically just went hey anyone you [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2142.7400000000002s)]
*  can come on in and fight and you know what we found out all [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2146.94s)]
*  those guys can't fight. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2150.54s)]
*  They just were good at pretending to fight but all of that [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2152.64s)]
*  was pretend. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2155.94s)]
*  It was all make-believe like that guy who told me when I was [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2157.04s)]
*  six that there were only four guys in the world who could [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2160.7400000000002s)]
*  kick his ass. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2163.34s)]
*  There were probably 15 guys in that building who could have [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2164.14s)]
*  kicked his ass if he got in a bar fight. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2166.34s)]
*  It was a coin flip whether he would win or lose that bar [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2168.94s)]
*  fight because he didn't fight. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2171.6400000000003s)]
*  This was all bullshit and we actually got to watch some of [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2173.04s)]
*  these guys competed they would come into the UFC and they [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2175.6400000000003s)]
*  believe it some of them believe their own horse shit. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2178.34s)]
*  I have this eagle crane punch that will make your heart [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2180.94s)]
*  explode and then they would gear up to like throw their [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2183.44s)]
*  eagle crane punch and a boxer would just jab him and it was [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2185.84s)]
*  like the first time they'd ever been hit and their nose is [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2189.1400000000003s)]
*  broke and they were like what a hoist Gracie would just you [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2191.34s)]
*  know take him down and then they're like wait time out. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2194.6400000000003s)]
*  What do I do down here? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2197.64s)]
*  I've never trained a day in my life on the ground. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2198.4399999999996s)]

*  Okay in 2002 when it really mattered from National Review [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2310.44s)]
*  back when National Review really mattered back in the old [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2315.04s)]
*  order when this guy was somebody quote the point for [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2318.54s)]
*  now is that Iraq shouldn't have existed in the first place. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2325.34s)]
*  It lasted this long. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2329.14s)]
*  Thanks to the Stalinist repression of the bath regime [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2330.24s)]
*  and the only reason we didn't get rid of it last time was [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2333.84s)]
*  that the Saudis despite despise the idea of toppling Hussein [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2336.54s)]
*  because they don't want us to establish an attractive [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2341.74s)]
*  alternative to the nasty form of government they profit from [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2344.04s)]
*  well boohoo for the Saudis if they haven't found oil if they [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2348.74s)]
*  hadn't found oil on their land. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2352.64s)]
*  They'd be a trivia question for students of comparative government [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2354.44s)]
*  today wouldn't such a huge move in flame the Middle East sure [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2357.54s)]
*  wouldn't such a humiliating effort give Osama bin Laden [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2361.84s)]
*  exactly what he wants. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2364.64s)]
*  Yes, wouldn't this cause the European diplomats to drop their [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2366.04s)]
*  egg spoons and disgust over such barbarism? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2370.54s)]

*  I guess so all that would in all likelihood be true until we [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2381.2400000000002s)]

*  all throughout the Arab world and that's money that could have [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2642.84s)]
*  been spent here at home. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2647.54s)]
*  Now you could agree or disagree with that argument, but it's [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2649.2400000000002s)]
*  not there. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2652.34s)]
*  It is a fairly reasonable one. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2653.44s)]
*  It isn't one that you can just scoff at and dismiss and like [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2657.34s)]
*  especially, you know again for the guy who was selling the war [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2661.04s)]
*  in Iraq to turn around and act like there's no argument that [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2665.34s)]
*  that money could have been put to better use like I'm not a [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2669.74s)]
*  welfare state guy, but man would we have been so much better [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2672.84s)]
*  off if those trillions of dollars had been spent on welfare [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2676.74s)]
*  rather than destroying Iraq for no reason. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2680.34s)]
*  Seems to me like they got a pretty strong argument on their [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2684.34s)]
*  hands and you don't seem to have a counter to it. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2687.54s)]
*  All right, let's keep playing. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2692.7400000000002s)]
*  And the reason why one because you kind of brought it up, but [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2695.2400000000002s)]
*  two was talking with pot about this yesterday. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2699.94s)]
*  My colleague Nick Cato Gio. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2703.94s)]
*  He made this argument that I don't necessarily fully subscribe [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2705.44s)]
*  to but I think it's worth taking seriously. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2708.2400000000002s)]
*  That the reason why Trump is talking about literally in his [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2710.24s)]
*  inaugural address about territorial expansion of the United [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2714.4399999999996s)]
*  States and taking the Panama Canal is that that is historically [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2717.54s)]
*  where nationalism has to go. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2726.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2729.14s)]
*  There is something about notions of greatness and nationalism [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2729.3399999999997s)]
*  that has to lead to greatness on the world stage and the only [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2735.74s)]
*  metric for that is either winning a war or expanding your [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2740.04s)]
*  territory, right? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2743.94s)]
*  And it feels to me like there's some truth to that. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2745.44s)]
*  It also be explained by Trump's Putin envy, right? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2750.84s)]
*  Oh, he got to do it in Ukraine. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2753.34s)]
*  He's cheap. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2754.54s)]
*  G gets to do it in Tibet and Taiwan. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2755.34s)]
*  I got to do it somewhere, right? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2757.64s)]
*  If I'm going to be remembered like one of those guys, but it's [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2758.74s)]
*  it's very strange to me how radicalism in one aspect of [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2761.24s)]
*  political philosophy so often for so many different types of [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2765.54s)]
*  people whether they start out as libertarians or stay libertarians [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2769.04s)]
*  nominally or they become Marxist or they become, you know, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2772.04s)]
*  ultra nationalist, whatever they end up just getting really [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2777.84s)]
*  worked up about international stuff rather than like even though [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2780.34s)]
*  they said that their transformation came because they cared about [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2784.74s)]
*  the plight of the forgotten man and the and the lower classes in [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2787.54s)]

*  It's weird to me. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2791.34s)]
*  Do you have a theory about it? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2792.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't really have a theory. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2793.14s)]
*  I mean, I haven't when it came to people and left friends that [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2794.54s)]
*  you know, went through this in college and stayed like that and [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2798.44s)]
*  they were the ones that were always pushing, you know, chomsky [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2801.34s)]
*  pause for a second. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2804.14s)]
*  Sure. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2805.04s)]
*  I mean the stupidity of you don't understand why people that aren't [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2806.14s)]
*  the believe in social services and aren't be giving resources [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2810.44s)]

*  equipment or foreign entanglements and going hey, why don't we [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2817.34s)]
*  just start by not spending that money that has you can't even [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2820.54s)]
*  come to that argument. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2824.04s)]
*  You can't figure out a working theory on that. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2825.14s)]
*  You can't figure out why a poor person in New York and look at [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2827.34s)]
*  the amount of money being spent in Ukraine and that it does no [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2831.1400000000003s)]

*  or just that you're concerned about the plight of the worker [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2837.1400000000003s)]

*  Yeah, like let me hear. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2845.2400000000002s)]
*  Let me try to really break this down for you guys because you're [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2846.7400000000002s)]
*  such, you know, just you're daunting intellects who obviously [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2849.04s)]
*  can't remember everyone like they can't even see what the argument [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2852.04s)]
*  would be or why people would be concerned. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2855.94s)]
*  Okay, let's see images constantly on the news of areas of Gaza [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2858.34s)]
*  being flattened with your money that was spent on bombs and you [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2861.54s)]
*  can't understand why a person that cares about the poor and [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2865.84s)]
*  goodness in the world might not go. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2868.94s)]
*  Hey instead of that can someone cover my hospital bill? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2870.54s)]

*  Yeah, why someone's brain would go there. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2875.2400000000002s)]
*  Maybe it's maybe we got to simplify this a little bit. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2877.1400000000003s)]
*  Okay, Jonah Michael, let's say you live in house a [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2879.44s)]
*  Okay, house a is your house. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2885.2400000000002s)]

*  in house be do you see where people concerned with the plight [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2905.2400000000002s)]
*  of people in house a might be opposed to that you got any [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2909.64s)]
*  working theories on that geez, I don't know. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2914.64s)]
*  I guess I'll just sit here scratching my head for the rest [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2919.24s)]
*  of the day trying to figure out why people concerned with the [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2922.04s)]
*  plate of working people in America might care about funding [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2926.24s)]
*  foreign Wars and of course, it's as if these guys who I mean, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2930.64s)]
*  I don't I don't really know much about Moynihan other than [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2935.64s)]
*  that. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2938.64s)]

*  I know more about Jonah Goldberg, but certainly Jonah [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2941.74s)]
*  Goldberg was supposed to be like, you know, it's like all [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2944.54s)]
*  these guys like Charles Krauthammer was one of them. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2949.3399999999997s)]
*  Bill Kristol was one of them. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2952.24s)]

*  these are the guys that are really really smart like Dave [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2960.24s)]

*  see Bill Kristol when he comes to debate Scott Horton and [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2965.14s)]
*  like, oh, he again, it's literally the only thing I could [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2968.04s)]
*  compare that to when Bill Kristol debated Scott Horton was [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2972.54s)]
*  early UFC's when someone from their local Dojo would come to [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2976.44s)]

*  knows how to fight you guys have been practicing nonsense. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2984.94s)]
*  And again, it was a painful thing for those guys at the [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2988.7400000000002s)]

*  a fight is one thing but it was losing a fight in a way where [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2994.7400000000002s)]
*  you go you have to start from square one. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=2997.44s)]

*  You do not and that was Bill Kristol when he came but all [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3005.94s)]
*  these guys. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3008.64s)]

*  It's not just the money. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3044.04s)]

*  too that like the biggest crackdowns of civil liberties [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3054.14s)]

*  But if you think about just when the terror wars that Jonah [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3065.44s)]
*  Goldberg was selling to the American people when they first [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3067.94s)]
*  rose up right the year that I just quoted that article from [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3071.94s)]
*  was 2002. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3075.14s)]
*  Well, what was introduced in 2002? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3076.44s)]
*  Was it late 2001 in the late 2001 or 2002 the Department of [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3079.54s)]
*  Homeland Security the TSA the Patriot Act, you know, warrantless [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3082.94s)]
*  wiretaps all of this stuff. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3087.94s)]
*  So like the idea that like these are two completely separate [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3090.14s)]
*  things like if you care about Americans, why are you even [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3094.84s)]
*  focused on Wars is just like it's stunningly ignorant. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3097.34s)]
*  It's like no serious conservative thinker ever would have [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3101.64s)]
*  not understood the argument there just really weak really [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3104.94s)]
*  really weak all the way around. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3109.44s)]
*  This kind of brings to mind. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3111.64s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever watched this special but Bill [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3112.54s)]
*  Hicks, he's got that special and he closes it out. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3115.44s)]
*  I wouldn't even say the end of it's a joke. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3117.8399999999997s)]
*  It's more of a poem where he's talking about how life is just [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3119.64s)]
*  a ride and then he closes it. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3122.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't even know if the math on this was true at the time, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3124.74s)]
*  but he closes it out with if we stop spending money on Wars, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3126.94s)]
*  we could feed clothes and everyone on Earth many times over [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3130.94s)]
*  and explore space together probably not but still yeah, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3135.3399999999997s)]
*  if you've never seen it, it's worth watching those two minutes. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3139.24s)]
*  It's pretty great. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3142.14s)]
*  But like I just that idea has been in the ether for so long [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3143.24s)]
*  amongst let's say classic liberals or people that are concerned [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3147.14s)]
*  your Glenn Greenwald's who might believe believe in more [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3151.74s)]
*  socialism and wealth distribution than we do but it's the it's [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3154.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't know if I was in a relationship and there was no [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3157.74s)]
*  food and we didn't have health care. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3160.24s)]
*  My wife kept buying jewelry. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3161.54s)]
*  It would be stupid to just go. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3163.04s)]
*  Hey, let's spend more money on the health care. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3164.74s)]
*  The first thing would be why are we buying all this jewelry [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3166.84s)]
*  if we can't afford the health care and the food? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3169.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3172.04s)]
*  Well, and as the point Glenn Greenwald's made which they don't [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3172.7400000000002s)]
*  even seem to realize that they were kind of making the leftist [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3175.54s)]
*  argument for them, but he goes well, there's people who want [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3178.54s)]
*  to see more social services here, but then they're complaining [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3181.1400000000003s)]
*  about Israel that has a lot of those social services and you're [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3185.7400000000002s)]
*  like, yeah, that's the point Glenn Greenwald's making but [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3188.94s)]
*  because listen, it's not just that we have funding Israel's [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3192.2400000000002s)]
*  war. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3194.8399999999997s)]
*  It's not like that's the only funding Israel gets Israel gets [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3195.64s)]
*  billions of dollars every year just regular life. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3198.04s)]
*  Why do those Jews get social services that we don't? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3201.04s)]
*  Well, the point, the health care sucks out there by the way, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3203.64s)]
*  I experienced it firsthand. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3205.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, that's okay. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3206.9399999999996s)]
*  Listen, I love Glenn Greenwald and consider him a hero, but [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3208.24s)]
*  you know, he should be a libertarian, but he's not but like [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3211.04s)]
*  that's kind of I think more the point we would make but the [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3215.04s)]
*  point Glenn Greenwald is making is that why is it that so I [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3218.04s)]
*  want these social services here? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3222.3399999999997s)]
*  They already have that there. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3223.94s)]
*  Why are we now sending them money when they already have the [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3225.7400000000002s)]
*  stuff that we're saying we can't afford to give our people his [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3228.7400000000002s)]
*  argument makes sense. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3231.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm not again. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3233.04s)]
*  I think your argument is superior that it's like actually [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3233.64s)]
*  you don't really want those social services, but they're [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3236.64s)]
*  talking about it. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3239.84s)]
*  Like he doesn't anyway, these guys just don't know how to [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3240.54s)]
*  fight in this world. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3243.54s)]
*  They don't know how to argue here. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3244.94s)]
*  Let's keep playing a little bit more and that sort of thing, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3246.54s)]
*  you know, you see the thing with Chomsky is that just the [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3250.74s)]
*  math doesn't make sense. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3253.8399999999997s)]
*  Could it possibly be that in every one of these foreign [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3255.24s)]
*  policy entanglements throughout the history of the United [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3258.74s)]
*  States that we're the wrong, we're the bad guy in this in [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3261.74s)]
*  every single instance. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3265.04s)]
*  I mean that obviously was pretty tough. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3266.74s)]
*  I guess you guys just aren't fans of United States. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3269.4399999999996s)]
*  I hate to just say like that seems like a like a sort of [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3273.8399999999997s)]
*  okay, go ahead. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3276.3399999999997s)]
*  You can you can pause it now. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3276.8399999999997s)]
*  Go ahead Rob. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3277.8399999999997s)]
*  This one annoyed me a lot when I was listening to it because [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3278.44s)]
*  it's not necessarily that we're the bad like I against Hitler. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3281.14s)]
*  We're not the bad guys. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3285.14s)]
*  The argument is do we need to be involved? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3286.34s)]
*  Does it help us to be involved in did it even help the world [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3288.64s)]
*  for us to be involved that that's the clear you're not [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3291.34s)]
*  really taking on the argument or the question. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3294.34s)]
*  Yes, there are other bad guys in the world. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3297.14s)]
*  Yes, you can even make the argument the American needs to [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3299.34s)]
*  stand up to those bad guys. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3301.94s)]
*  The argument that we're making is it's been a waste of money [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3303.04s)]
*  and hasn't actually helped anyone and then I you're more [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3305.7400000000002s)]
*  of an expert the argument on World War two is that we just [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3308.14s)]
*  seeded all of Europe to to Stalin. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3310.44s)]
*  How did that do for the world? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3312.74s)]
*  But I even without that, I'm just saying the argument is [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3314.54s)]
*  not whether or not over the bad guy in everyone. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3317.44s)]
*  It's did we need to be involved? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3320.64s)]
*  Did it serve our interest? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3322.44s)]
*  Did it help anybody? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3323.54s)]
*  Yeah, well also just some of them lot and good. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3325.14s)]
*  Yeah, no, exactly. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3328.14s)]
*  No, of course. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3329.64s)]
*  And again for the guys who were supposed to be intellectuals [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3330.44s)]
*  who are supposed to be these like conservative, you know, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3335.24s)]
*  like again, it's in the same way that that, you know, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3337.34s)]
*  Beta O'Rourke just had the it factor according to CNN and [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3344.1400000000003s)]
*  MSNBC in the old order, you know, Jonah Goldberg was just [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3347.7400000000002s)]
*  super smart in the same way that they would say that, you [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3351.94s)]
*  know, like whatever Michael Avenatti is. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3354.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, this guy is really a Crusader for Justice or something, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3357.34s)]
*  you know, the the porn stars lawyer is a really above board [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3360.7400000000002s)]
*  guy. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3364.2400000000002s)]
*  But in the same sense, it's like first of all, let's just [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3364.94s)]
*  say even if your argument is he goes so you're saying it just [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3368.44s)]
*  happens to be that we're the bad guy in all of these conflicts [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3372.3399999999997s)]
*  and they're like just laughing as if well, it's not like a [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3377.24s)]
*  matter of logic that that couldn't be the case. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3381.3399999999997s)]
*  Like what do you mean? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3384.14s)]
*  Yeah, governments can be the bad guys. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3385.54s)]
*  I mean like look again, I agree with your characterization. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3388.24s)]
*  I think that if you want to say in World War Two that the [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3392.14s)]
*  Nazis and the Imperial Japanese were the bad guys. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3396.24s)]
*  Okay, I mean they were pretty evil. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3400.74s)]
*  So I'm not really going to give you too much of an argument [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3402.64s)]
*  about that. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3404.74s)]
*  They're like if you if you wanted to if you were writing a [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3405.3399999999997s)]
*  novel and you wanted to come up with an evil regime either [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3408.04s)]
*  of those guys would be like, oh wow, you really came up with [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3411.74s)]
*  some scary stuff there. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3414.3399999999997s)]
*  Well done. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3415.3399999999997s)]
*  Now on the side of the Allies was Joseph Stalin. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3416.94s)]
*  That one's going to be a little bit tough to spin as one of [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3421.04s)]
*  the good guys. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3423.94s)]

*  were good that would be actually taking on the argument. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3470.44s)]
*  Which war is it that you want to own? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3473.7400000000002s)]

*  and and laughed at. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3511.54s)]

*  corrupt. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3545.74s)]

*  me to say that the a bunch of corrupt politicians with their [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3559.54s)]
*  With the help of their faux intellectuals like Jonah Goldberg [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3565.24s)]
*  at National Review that they sold an evil policy that what [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3568.64s)]
*  that proves what like what it's just if you think about how [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3573.04s)]
*  stupid the argument is it's like, okay, so if I were to say [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3576.54s)]

*  the premise that the people in America are oppressed by [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3703.94s)]
*  the same evil government in the elites and you start [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3706.64s)]
*  from the assumption that we're wrong and then work backward. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3709.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's the original sin kind of view of foreign [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3711.8399999999997s)]
*  policy and you know, like if you're no Mchomsky and [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3714.44s)]
*  you're dedicating time in 1976 to saying that father [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3717.24s)]

*  to this point they work backwards. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3734.3399999999997s)]
*  So it is weird to me to see these people were not a [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3735.74s)]
*  fault for bombing Cambodia only on the right argument [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3738.4399999999996s)]
*  Tarian's taking this kind of argument that is fundamentally [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3741.24s)]
*  an argument that looks to work backwards from the conclusion [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3745.14s)]
*  that we probably did this. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3748.54s)]

*  So what just because it's called provoked because the [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3841.54s)]
*  argument is that we provoked this conflict. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3844.64s)]
*  It's already lost or that proves that you're working [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3847.04s)]

*  got to wrap up your question in the sense that these people [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3970.4399999999996s)]
*  are never worked up about the sort of territorial desires [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3973.24s)]
*  of Putin. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3978.24s)]
*  I'm trying to reassemble a Russian Empire not in a Soviet [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3979.14s)]
*  way as such but kind of Soviet and it's really the argument [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3981.8399999999997s)]
*  that you get from Chomsky and you know, Glenn Greenwald [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3985.3399999999997s)]
*  who's been on our podcast a bunch of times and who I like [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3988.74s)]
*  personally by the way, and I think he's a very very bright [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3991.24s)]
*  guy. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3993.04s)]
*  I just disagree with him a lot. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3993.24s)]
*  He did the same thing that Chomsky used to do. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3995.9399999999996s)]
*  I don't care about that stuff because it's not my government. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=3998.24s)]
*  It's not my taxpayer dollars and I think is an incredible [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4001.3399999999997s)]
*  dodge which is in you find times when they do care, you [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4004.24s)]
*  know, but but Israel were giving them it's like I used [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4009.04s)]
*  to say this about Israel time is well, you know our taxpayer [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4011.74s)]
*  dollars are funding that that's why we're on the streets. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4015.64s)]
*  That's why we don't care about Syria as such. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4018.8399999999997s)]
*  Look, I lived in Sweden for a number of years and I've never [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4021.14s)]
*  met any I've seen a culture that is so obsessed with a country [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4024.04s)]
*  so far away and has so little. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4029.3399999999997s)]
*  It's like 17,000 Jews in Sweden and they don't give any money [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4030.8399999999997s)]
*  but they are out there on the streets every time Israel does [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4035.4399999999996s)]
*  something. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4039.24s)]
*  There's something else motivating us in what that is. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4039.54s)]
*  Is it anti-Semitism? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4042.8399999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of times it is but I think there's other stuff [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4043.8399999999997s)]
*  too is, you know, it's a puppet United States. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4047.3399999999997s)]
*  It's just kind of this anti-US argument again. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4049.14s)]
*  Why those people have gone that far. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4052.04s)]
*  It's like look one of the things I don't understand either [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4055.64s)]
*  and we have a lot of mutual friends here and there's a lot [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4058.44s)]
*  of people I respect but I see a lot of people like at the [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4060.8399999999997s)]
*  bulwark for instance that don't like Donald Trump and are [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4064.44s)]
*  rightfully outraged by I mean, especially like I haven't [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4068.3399999999997s)]
*  looked but I'm sure they're outraged and they absolutely [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4071.44s)]
*  should be about this Jan six pardons. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4073.74s)]
*  It's like it's a disgrace and I'm glad that there's some [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4075.94s)]
*  Republicans coming out and saying this don't pretend to [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4078.34s)]
*  love the police when you're saying to everybody even JD [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4080.94s)]

*  But like I've seen it take over the brains of so many people [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4085.84s)]
*  that they stop even caring about conservatism as such, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4089.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, they're not really making arguments. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4095.6400000000003s)]
*  It's just been completely overwhelmed by some a friend [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4097.34s)]
*  who I like and writes over there. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4101.24s)]

*  But you the problem was he didn't come out against Trump [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4111.44s)]
*  hard enough and this is I actually maybe it wasn't Jimmy [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4113.639999999999s)]
*  Carver somebody that yeah, it was fine. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4116.639999999999s)]
*  But but I really wish they would and that kind of obsession [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4118.94s)]
*  I think is what happens to these people and libertarian [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4122.74s)]
*  right, etc. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4125.74s)]

*  it talk a lot about Jimmy Carter at the expense of everything [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4129.94s)]

*  We're counting these people. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4139.139999999999s)]
*  Have you ever heard them say anything about tariffs about [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4140.139999999999s)]

*  Well, let's take Greenland. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4151.139999999999s)]
*  We should have that it's ours. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4152.139999999999s)]
*  It's good for us. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4153.44s)]

*  Like let's go back to the debates between Buckley and [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4155.74s)]
*  Reagan about the Panama Canal and we should just like we [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4158.54s)]
*  built it and everyone died there was American which is [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4161.44s)]
*  actually not true. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4164.139999999999s)]
*  But that kind of argument is they seem to not have that [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4164.94s)]
*  ideological core that you know makes them associate with [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4168.139999999999s)]
*  either a party or an ideology watching these people be [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4171.639999999999s)]
*  deranged by this and I do think that there's people that [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4174.639999999999s)]
*  we like and we know and I think I don't mean to say the [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4177.54s)]
*  bulwark has a lot of good people over there a lot of people [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4180.339999999999s)]
*  I like it. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4182.24s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4183.04s)]
*  It's like a shorthand at this point. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4183.839999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4185.139999999999s)]
*  Sure people that have just I don't see like the dispatch is [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4185.44s)]
*  great because I see like Scotland Sycamore has a column [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4190.04s)]
*  and like he's writing about these economic issues that are [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4193.24s)]
*  like what we've always talked about which I think is is [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4196.34s)]
*  so you want my theory about why a lot of these people don't [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4199.64s)]
*  like to talk about economics because I think there's a [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4202.84s)]
*  really basic explanation for it is complicated. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4205.34s)]
*  Well, it's it's complicated. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4208.84s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4211.24s)]
*  It's it's the reason why they don't like to talk about [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4212.14s)]
*  economics is that you know, like Irving Kristol used to [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4214.64s)]
*  say there's no non capitalist economic theory because the [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4217.74s)]
*  second you get out of capitalism or free-market economics [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4222.84s)]
*  you are bringing in stuff from other realms of thinking and [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4226.54s)]
*  imposing it on something that doesn't you know, like like [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4231.54s)]
*  there is no Catholic theory of economics in the end and I [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4235.84s)]
*  I'm not saying that there isn't a Catholic understanding of [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4241.24s)]
*  economics, right? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4243.04s)]
*  But theory has a specific meeting in social sciences, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4244.24s)]
*  right? It's like a falsifiable thing, right? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4247.24s)]
*  And the reason I bring that up is that free-market economics [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4250.24s)]
*  mean you're the guy who you made the illusion to broken [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4253.94s)]
*  windows earlier with it's funny. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4256.94s)]
*  You actually made references to both broken windows both the [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4258.44s)]
*  James Q Wilson broken windows stuff and to Bastiats broken [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4262.24s)]
*  window. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4265.54s)]
*  I'm referring to the Bastiats stuff, right? [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4265.84s)]
*  So the do-know-Bastiats stuff says that all economics boils [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4267.54s)]
*  down to trade-offs right choices, right? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4274.139999999999s)]
*  And so you can celebrate the money that the windowmaker is [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4277.34s)]
*  getting from the broken window, but that's taking money that [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4279.94s)]
*  would have been spent for other things. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4282.84s)]
*  It's it's all TomSole, right? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4285.54s)]
*  It's it's it's it's you can't spend the same dollar twice. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4287.44s)]
*  That is really boring and annoying for ideologues who want [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4291.94s)]
*  to live in a zero-sum universe, right? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4295.84s)]
*  And the beauty of talking about foreign policy is it lends [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4299.44s)]
*  itself to Manichaeanism. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4303.24s)]
*  It lends itself to good versus evil in all regards. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4304.44s)]
*  It it lends itself to utopianism and you can have utopianism [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4307.54s)]
*  in economics. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4313.94s)]
*  It's just that utopianism economics has been falsified so [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4314.639999999999s)]
*  many freaking times that it's hard for them to get any [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4317.339999999999s)]
*  traction with it. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4319.94s)]
*  But you say, you know, once we get rid of the Jews, you know, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4320.74s)]
*  like that's the way of talking about the sunny uplands of [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4324.339999999999s)]
*  history. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4326.74s)]
*  And I think it's why people move towards things that are [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4327.54s)]
*  basically literary arguments or theological arguments because [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4331.84s)]
*  to argue about economics means to acknowledge the broken the [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4336.84s)]
*  cricket timber of humanity, the flawed nature of the Metaxi, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4340.54s)]
*  the flawed nature of human life that says you cannot have [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4343.9400000000005s)]
*  your cake and eat it too. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4347.04s)]
*  And and that just messes with the heads of ideologues in a [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4348.64s)]
*  way that or fanatics do you want a better term because I [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4353.34s)]
*  think we're both kind of ideologues. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4356.24s)]
*  And the other thing is I'm just curious. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4358.9400000000005s)]
*  Like according to this breakdown, I mean, it's so incoherent [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4361.14s)]
*  and rambling and then just straw manning. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4365.84s)]
*  That's why if they get rid of the Jews and first of all, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4368.740000000001s)]
*  I brought up Bastiat before they did like, I don't know what [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4371.4400000000005s)]
*  they're talking about. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4373.740000000001s)]
*  And yes, that is our position that all of I agree with soul [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4374.54s)]
*  and Bastiat all of economics is trade-offs all of foreign [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4377.34s)]
*  policy to none of us are claiming we want to get rid of [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4380.54s)]
*  all the Jews and then there will be utopia. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4383.240000000001s)]
*  It's just nonsense. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4385.64s)]
*  But so but money and resources spent on Wars means that it [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4386.64s)]
*  can't be spent on other things interesting. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4391.4400000000005s)]
*  And so some people might have a preference that it's just [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4393.9400000000005s)]
*  spent on other things. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4396.04s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4397.54s)]

*  down to one thing you're going to say stupid stuff. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4520.34s)]
*  So if you're going to reduce every controversy down to [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4524.74s)]
*  whether it's good for Trump or bad for Trump or anti Trump [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4526.84s)]
*  or pro Trump or whether this person was right on Trump or [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4529.44s)]
*  wrong on Trump you're going to miss a lot you're going to [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4531.839999999999s)]
*  if you think everything boils if you think tariffs or fix [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4535.04s)]
*  everything you're just stupid right? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4537.94s)]
*  You just don't know how economics work right and and so [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4540.24s)]
*  much of our politics is trying to reduce everything down to [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4544.139999999999s)]
*  one reason you know one thing no one ever goes into a car [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4547.44s)]
*  lot and says I'm going to I'm here to buy a red car today [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4550.54s)]
*  right, you know because there are other things on your [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4553.839999999999s)]
*  checklist and yet that's the way we want to have arguments [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4555.44s)]
*  and I think that on the economics thing it is actually [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4558.54s)]
*  a simplicity thing too is that when you sit around a dinner [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4560.74s)]
*  table in this city and there's 10 people there and they're [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4563.44s)]
*  all college-educated, but they're not political people [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4567.84s)]
*  as such they're all going to if you went around offer an [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4570.44s)]
*  opinion on Israel October 7th Palestinian territories [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4574.34s)]
*  Etc because they know a sort of bare minimum and they will [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4579.04s)]
*  work up some sort of moral outrage about it. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4581.54s)]
*  If you go around asking about tariffs, they'll be like I [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4584.04s)]
*  literally have no idea what you're talking about. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4586.14s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4587.64s)]
*  Maybe it's good. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4588.14s)]
*  Maybe it's bad, but I thought I thought one of the most [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4588.740000000001s)]
*  interesting things and no one really has noticed this Steve [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4590.84s)]
*  Bannon who I've interviewed a few times who's a good [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4594.240000000001s)]
*  interview. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4598.04s)]
*  All right, we're gonna have to stop it. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4598.4400000000005s)]
*  I was waiting for them to maybe get to something approaching [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4599.740000000001s)]
*  a point but nothing else really came. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4602.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what to say then they just go on. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4604.740000000001s)]
*  It's like they invoke me and Scott and then they later [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4606.64s)]
*  talk about Daryl Cooper at some point to and it's just a [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4609.4400000000005s)]
*  total straw man never taking on anything that anyone is [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4612.04s)]
*  actually saying again, this is just its weakness. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4615.44s)]
*  It's like, you know, you can't actually compete. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4621.24s)]
*  They know that like they would just get the end and this is [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4625.04s)]
*  why all of the audience has gone away from guys like this [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4627.74s)]
*  and to alternative voices. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4631.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what else to say about that to say that [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4633.139999999999s)]
*  any of us are making the argument. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4635.54s)]
*  In fact, we are the ones expressly not making these [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4637.04s)]
*  arguments when people like Jonah Goldberg were making arguments [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4640.839999999999s)]
*  for why we need to go overthrow Saddam Hussein. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4643.94s)]
*  All of the arguments were to not consider all of the costs [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4647.139999999999s)]
*  of this policy. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4651.24s)]
*  Nobody here is saying like I'm certainly never making anything [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4652.44s)]
*  even close to the argument that like if we just hadn't have [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4657.04s)]
*  fought the war in Iraq, then everything would be perfect [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4659.54s)]
*  under Saddam Hussein, right? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4661.639999999999s)]
*  Like nobody's making that claim. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4663.339999999999s)]
*  We're pointing out that it's a matter of trade-offs and that [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4665.24s)]
*  the trade-offs that you're pushing for are very bad ones [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4668.04s)]
*  to make that leave to much worse outcomes. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4671.14s)]
*  But this was I don't know what to say. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4675.14s)]
*  I mean this to me it was interesting. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4676.84s)]
*  I didn't just want to talk about this just like as an ego [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4679.64s)]
*  thing to like, you know, wreck these guys who brought me up. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4682.74s)]
*  I can see 10% of it was that but it's like I just thought [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4685.64s)]
*  this was a great microcosm of the old order why it has died [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4689.54s)]
*  how much they are still unable to unable to grapple with [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4694.24s)]
*  any of that stuff and just how like I said, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4698.74s)]
*  how much these guys just can't fight these guys just can't [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4701.04s)]
*  fight is literally it reminds me of one of those goddamn [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4703.84s)]
*  karate. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_vVX0KgcQ&t=4706.74s)]
