# Dave Smith | We Are At War With Iran | Part Of The Problem 1275
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg)
*  Hello, hello, what's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. I am rolling solo for this episode. Rob is still I think traveling home [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=11.18s)]
*  on the west coast on his way back here. Not quite sure. But you know, obviously, we kind [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=18.16s)]
*  of know what we're going to talk about for for today's episode. I was on Breaking Points [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  earlier today, and I was pretty harsh on President Trump. And I've been I had a couple of posts [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  on Twitter there. And I've been watching the it's been a bit of a meltdown in my replies [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=37.92s)]
*  with you know, some people very happy with what I said, some people very upset about [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  I said, but I thought for today, I would kind of just do an episode on how I'm feeling about [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=49.26s)]
*  Donald Trump. And obviously, the the current situation in the Middle East, where I would [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=55.02s)]
*  start just by saying that we are at war with Iran, as of right now, a lot of people are [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=60.42s)]
*  kind of framing this as if like, Israel's at war with Iran, and we're waiting to see [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  whether or not the US gets involved. I think that's fundamentally wrong. And I think we [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  are at war with Iran right now. I think Donald Trump has already led us into another [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=78.26s)]
*  catastrophic war in the Middle East. Hopefully, I am wrong about that. This is this is one [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=82.86000000000001s)]
*  where I really, really would be quite pleased to be proven wrong. And maybe later this week [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=90.06s)]
*  or next month or something, I can say, okay, I overreacted a little bit. I don't think that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=95.7s)]
*  is the case. I hope I am wrong on that. I will gladly eat crow and be proven wrong on [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  this one. But let's before even getting into that, let me do like a little bit of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=105.78s)]
*  background. I don't want to be too repetitive with things I've said before. So I'll try my [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=111.54s)]
*  best to go through this quickly. But then we can kind of get into where exactly we are [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=115.54s)]
*  right now and how this might play out going forward. So just to be clear, Iran is a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=119.38s)]
*  country that has been in in the crosshairs of some very powerful people for quite a long [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=129.5s)]
*  period of time. Iran was of course, if as many of you know, or might remember or learned [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=137.06s)]
*  after the fact, immediately after 911, Iran was put by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=144.98s)]
*  on the axis of evil. They said Iraq, Iran and North Korea were the countries that were [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=151.82s)]
*  put on this list immediately following 911. And of course, as many of you guys know, those [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=158.22s)]
*  three, those three countries had absolutely nothing to do with with 911. Now, the one [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=164.98s)]
*  of the reasons and one of the major reasons why they were put in the lines of fire right [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=170.86s)]
*  away was because Israel wanted to have a regime change there. This is something that is not [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=177.06s)]
*  this isn't a conspiracy theory. This is well documented, and they've admitted it over and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=183.66s)]
*  over again in their own words. Now, this is stuff I've gotten into a lot before, so we [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=190.22s)]
*  don't need to go through the whole history of it. But most of you guys listening to this are [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=194.42s)]
*  probably already aware. But this was this was a major part of what was known as the clean [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=197.66s)]
*  break strategy that Israel had now essentially, you can go Okay, so the Iranian revolution [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=203.06s)]
*  happened in 1979. The regime that's currently in control of Iran has been in control of Iran [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=210.3s)]
*  since 1979. Israel in the in the 70s, I think a couple years before that was in the late 70s. At [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=215.82000000000002s)]
*  Camp David, when they made their peace with Egypt, they had promised to eventually give the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians a state. Of course, this had been a big crisis in the Middle East going back to from [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=232.22000000000003s)]
*  the late 1940s, 1947, 1948. In 1967, Israel fought the Six Day War with Egypt and Jordan. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=238.66s)]
*  That's when they took control of Gaza and East Jerusalem in the West Bank. And so Israel had [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=247.22s)]
*  control of these areas that had millions of of inhabitants living in it. And so there was always [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=253.94s)]
*  talk of what was to be done with this. The international community had always overwhelmingly [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=260.98s)]
*  supported a two state solution back to before the creation of the state of Israel. I mean, the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=266.18s)]
*  original UN partition recommendation in 1947 was that there would be a Jewish state and a Palestinian [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=271.3s)]
*  state on the land that is today known as Israel. And so in the seven so in 1967, the Israel took [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=277.06s)]
*  control of Gaza in the West Bank. By by the 70s already the international community in this case, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=284.9s)]
*  the United States of America was pressuring Israel to make a two state solution to give the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=290.42s)]
*  Palestinians their own state. Fast forward to the 90s in the early 90s is when the Oslo Accords [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=295.62s)]
*  started. And this was supposed to be the culmination of that process that they were going to, you know, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=302.42s)]
*  like begin that what they call the peace process. And the peace process was supposed to culminate [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=309.22s)]
*  in a Palestinian state. That was the idea. And of course, famously, Bill Clinton brought Yasser [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=315.86s)]
*  Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin to Washington, DC, and they did a bunch of photo ops of this was the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=322.42s)]
*  leader of the Palestinians and the Prime Minister of Israel, they shook hands, they signed an [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=329.06s)]
*  agreement, and they were supposed to start working toward an eventual two state solution. Now, the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=333.14000000000004s)]
*  thinking or at least the stated thinking, things are always a little bit more complicated than this, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=342.42s)]
*  but for broad strokes purposes, the stated thinking of Yitzhak Rabin and the Israelis who [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=347.7s)]
*  wanted to work toward a pseudo Palestinian state, they were never going to give them a full state, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=355.46s)]
*  but regardless of that, the thinking was that essentially, the Jews in Israel had had this, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=361.3s)]
*  they had had horrible relations with the Arab world, and much of the Arab world wouldn't recognize [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=369.14s)]
*  Israel. And the thinking was that this was all over the Palestinian question, the refugee problem [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=375.14s)]
*  and the occupation, and that the other Arab countries were never going to recognize Israel [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=381.06s)]
*  or normalize relations until they dealt with the Palestinian problem. And so that was the idea of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=385.62s)]
*  Oslo was that, well, look, if we have this peace process, and we give them a Palestinian state, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=390.9s)]
*  we can settle the Palestinian problem, and then we can have normal relations and peace with the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=395.86s)]
*  surrounding Arab countries. That was the idea. So Benjamin Netanyahu was always somebody who opposed [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=400.98s)]
*  this and evidently wrote a book about it. I've never read this Benjamin Netanyahu book, but [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=408.58000000000004s)]
*  evidently he wrote a book with a lot of this stuff in it. But I do know that in 1996, that's when the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=413.70000000000005s)]
*  Clean Break Memo was sent to Benjamin Netanyahu. This was written by Richard Pearl and David Wormser, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=419.38s)]
*  a couple other neocons were authors on it as well. And what the Clean Break was, was a break [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=425.38s)]
*  from that peace process. That was the idea of the Clean Break. And this was the neocons and the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  Likudniks strategy was that we essentially, you've had this whole plan known as the Peace Process [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=440.26s)]
*  with its land exchanges, as they called it, that is supposed to ultimately lead to a Palestinian [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=450.74s)]
*  state. We want a clean break from that. We want to get away from that. And so what we're going to do, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=460.98s)]
*  right, so basically they flipped the Rabin model on its head and they said, you guys have this all [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=467.46000000000004s)]
*  wrong. You're saying that you need to make peace with the Palestinians so that you can normalize [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=473.86s)]
*  relationships with the broader Arab country, with the broader Arab world, with the surrounding Arab [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=479.78s)]
*  nation states. But see, that's all wrong. What you want to do is get away from the peace process, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=485.38s)]
*  get away from the idea of a Palestinian state. And you'll do that by overthrowing the regimes [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=491.14s)]
*  that are giving you trouble around the area. And this way, you don't have to make peace with the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=497.46s)]
*  Palestinians so you can normalize relations with the broader Arab world. We can overthrow [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=504.1s)]
*  the governments that you don't like. You can normalize relations with the surrounding Arab [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=508.82000000000005s)]
*  world without having to give the Palestinians their own state. So this was the ultimate plan [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=514.66s)]
*  of the neocons. And it's very, so the Clean Break Memo was written in 1996. It's very interesting [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=520.26s)]
*  to read the neoconservative writing from that period of time, because it's before 9-11, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=527.22s)]
*  but after they've made this decision to embark on the foreign policy that becomes realized [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  after 9-11. Now, the reason why it's so interesting to read the neocons writing in the 90s is because [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=541.22s)]
*  as they're fighting all of the wars, all the terror wars after 9-11, they have this, you know, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=547.5400000000001s)]
*  they have a 9-11 related justification for why they're going to fight all these wars. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=552.74s)]
*  But before 9-11, when they didn't know that they were going to get that gift to them, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=558.66s)]
*  they had a whole different, they had very different stated objectives and stated [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=565.0600000000001s)]
*  justifications. And so you get into more of like, oh, what's really going on here? What's [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=570.58s)]
*  really going on here? And basically, the regimes that were giving Israel problems, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=575.62s)]
*  and when I say giving Israel problems, meaning they were defiant of Israel, they were supporting [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=582.5s)]
*  Israel's enemies. I mean, back from the very beginning, in 1947, 1948, the creation of Israel [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=587.62s)]
*  involved something like 750,000 Palestinians being forced or fleeing their homes and never being [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=594.82s)]
*  allowed back in. It led to this permanent refugee crisis. And so there was the refugee crisis, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=603.54s)]
*  and then after 1967, they were occupied by the Israelis. So there was this, there was resistance [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=610.66s)]
*  to Israel from the very beginning, and that included terrorism. Of course, there was also [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=617.3s)]
*  terrorists, terrorism from the Israeli side. And even before the creation of the state of Israel, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=622.66s)]
*  there were Zionist militias, paramilitary organizations that were terrorists by nature. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=628.58s)]
*  And of course, after the creation of the state of Israel, the state of Israel engaged in all types [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=635.46s)]
*  of actions that were terrorists in nature and still do to this day. The regimes that were giving [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=640.1800000000001s)]
*  Israel a bunch of problems were, to list off a few, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, Muammar Gaddafi's Libya, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=646.9000000000001s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad's Syria. These were all regimes that didn't recognize Israel as legitimate and [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=655.94s)]
*  would, to different varying degrees, would fund and arm some of the, you know, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=665.94s)]
*  resistance groups from their perspective or terrorist organizations from the Israeli perspective. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=672.34s)]
*  So, Iran was always the big one. Iran was always the one they wanted the most, but it was also the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=678.34s)]
*  hardest one to get. And in fact, immediately after 9-11, there was some kind of inter-fighting about [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=683.86s)]
*  this. Sharon was the prime minister of Israel when, in 2001, when 9-11 happened. Sharon's envoy, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=691.22s)]
*  blanking on his name, but I know that he initially argued when he had first seen the plans of the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=701.22s)]
*  Iraq. He had tried to persuade the George W. Bush to do Iran first. They wanted to overthrow Saddam [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=706.66s)]
*  Hussein, but they wanted to overthrow the mullahs in Iran first. And that was a source of some [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=715.06s)]
*  infighting. Ultimately, they were told that, don't worry, Iran's next. Iran is coming next. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=720.26s)]
*  And so, ultimately, they said, okay, that's good enough. And then they supported them. Their [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=732.26s)]
*  concern, of course, was that, you know, if you just overthrew Saddam Hussein and didn't overthrow [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=735.7s)]
*  the mullahs in Iran, you would just be handing more influence over to Iran. They ended up being [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=740.42s)]
*  correct about those concerns, but of course, they fell in line and supported the war in Iraq. And [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=744.5s)]
*  then, for the 2002, Israel was involved in pumping out some of the most ridiculous propaganda about [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=749.78s)]
*  how Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was in on the, you know, the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=756.1s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction and was in on 9-11 and all this other stuff. But again, you can go [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=760.42s)]
*  read the neocons in their own words. You could read, in the 90s, in our project for a new American [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=765.4599999999999s)]
*  century, where they wrote out that they wanted to overthrow Saddam Hussein for Israel. It had [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=771.2199999999999s)]
*  nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction or any of this other nonsense. But after 9-11, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=775.54s)]
*  that, you know, that became very effective propaganda that, oh, we're just doing this [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=781.06s)]
*  because we're trying to stop another 9-11 in a post-9-11 world. We can't allow Saddam [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=786.9s)]
*  Hussein to have weapons of mass destruction. As General Wesley Clark, who is the supreme commander [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=791.22s)]
*  of the NATO allies, as well as a four-star general, as he is on record and he has repeated this [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=798.5799999999999s)]
*  multiple times and really doubled down on it. But he said that in late 2001, he saw what's known now [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=804.34s)]
*  as the famous seven countries in five years. He saw that what he claimed was a classified document [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=811.14s)]
*  that he was evidently illegally shown because he was a general in Bill Clinton's administration, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=818.42s)]
*  but he was a civilian at this point, or at least not in the administration. He was shown a classified [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=823.38s)]
*  document that said that it had been decided that we were going to overthrow seven countries in the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=829.62s)]
*  next five years. The last one on that list is Iran. The other six have already been completed. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=835.3s)]
*  We are on the seventh country. So like that's what's going on here. And that is the only answer that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=842.3399999999999s)]
*  makes everything else make sense. So Benjamin Netanyahu, of course, the current prime minister [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=849.4599999999999s)]
*  of Israel, the longest serving prime minister in Israeli history, he has been, no exaggeration, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=855.8599999999999s)]
*  I think I've heard someone say he was making the claims in the 80s, but the furthest back I could [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=861.86s)]
*  find, I believe, was 1991. But so at least since I was eight years old, Benjamin Netanyahu has been [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=868.42s)]
*  saying that Iran is on the cusp of developing nuclear weapons. All through the 90s, he would [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=878.74s)]
*  have precise dates. He would have all types of arguments about why he knows why their intelligence [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=886.26s)]
*  is so good that they know that it's one to three years. In one to three years, the Iranians are [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=893.78s)]
*  going to have nuclear weapons. Over and over and over again, he said this in 91 and 95 and 98. In [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=899.22s)]
*  2001 and 2002, he came and testified before the US Congress, said we have to overthrow Saddam Hussein. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=905.78s)]
*  It'll have positive reverberations around the region. Said he has weapons of mass destruction. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=914.26s)]
*  Said the Iranians are working on a nuke. He also advocated that we overthrow Muammar Qaddafi in [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=918.98s)]
*  Libya and overthrow the government in Iran. So he just came over to America and advocated for [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=923.62s)]
*  three regime change wars blatantly. Again, this isn't a theory. It's not a conspiracy theory. This [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=929.7s)]
*  is on the record information. And so this entire time, he's been claiming that Iran is about to [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=935.46s)]
*  get nuclear weapons. When Obama signed the deal with Iran, he said that now Iran has been fast [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=942.02s)]
*  tracked on their path to nuclear weapons. So you know, fast track. It was one to three years in 1991 [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=950.26s)]
*  and then in 2013, it was fast tracked. So anyway, we're now eight years later from there and, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=957.46s)]
*  excuse me, 12 years later from there and still no nuclear weapon in Iran. But that didn't stop him [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=966.42s)]
*  from going to the United Nations where he had that daffy duck bomb, like a big circle black bomb, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=972.9799999999999s)]
*  and the black was filled all the way up to like 90%. He said, this is how close they are. They're [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=978.42s)]
*  this close to getting a nuclear weapon. Always Benjamin Netanyahu has been, he's constantly been [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=982.5799999999999s)]
*  trying to get the US to go overthrow the regime in Iran. And make no mistake about it, that's what [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=990.02s)]
*  this latest attack is about. It is not about destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities. No one [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=995.94s)]
*  is really concerned that Iran has a nuke. Iran has what is known as a latent deterrent. So essentially, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1001.62s)]
*  they've been enriching uranium up to a point to have essentially not a nuclear deterrent, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1010.98s)]
*  but what's known as a latent deterrent where you basically get close enough to say, hey, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1018.34s)]
*  I could make nukes if we wanted to. And that's supposed to be enough of a threat that what's [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1022.66s)]
*  happening right now doesn't happen. Now, the idea being that no one's going to actually come attack [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1029.46s)]
*  you if you have a nuclear weapon. They don't want to make a nuclear weapon because they think they'll [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1034.42s)]
*  get bombed if they actually start getting close to making it. So they've settled for this latent [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1038.34s)]
*  threat area where they, you know, they don't have a nuclear weapon. They've opened their books. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1042.98s)]
*  They're a member of the nonproliferation treaty. They have inspections. They're like, look, this [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1047.78s)]
*  is what we're doing. But we're not going any further than that. So, you know, let's leave it at that. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1052.26s)]
*  Now, it might, it's worth understanding, like that there's a few other like elements here that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1060.82s)]
*  have pushed Iran to want a nuclear weapon. And one of them is that we don't really mess with nuclear [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1068.1s)]
*  armed countries. And that's the truth. You know, of all of the countries that I've been talking [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1074.58s)]
*  about here, there was one who was on the list after 9-11. And that we've never really messed [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1080.66s)]
*  with. I mean, we put sanctions on them, but we won't attack them. And that's North Korea. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1087.78s)]
*  And how did North Korea manage to get us not to attack them? Well, they develop nuclear weapons, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1091.94s)]
*  and they've tested them several times. And so, what are you going to do? You know, in [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1096.98s)]
*  I mean, since World War II, America has fought a lot of wars. We've been in many, many wars [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1101.8600000000001s)]
*  since 1945, when World War II ended. We fought wars in Korea and Vietnam, Serbia, Iraq, Libya, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1110.3400000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan, many and many others, just to name a few. But you might notice that one of the things [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1122.0200000000002s)]
*  that all of the countries that we fought in have in common is that they do not have nuclear weapons. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1127.22s)]
*  Now, there's some exceptions to that. I mean, we had like a drone bomb campaign in Pakistan, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1132.98s)]
*  you know, but that was kind of approved by the government there. And then when they, I mean, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1139.54s)]
*  they asked us to stop a few times when they really got serious, we did kind of cut it back. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1143.94s)]
*  There's, and the other example you could use is probably, I guess, we've supported [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1148.58s)]
*  Ukraine, who has had some successful strikes inside Russia. So there's like, you know, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1152.66s)]
*  there's, but generally speaking, you don't really get messed with if you have nuclear weapons, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1157.78s)]
*  at least not nearly as much as if you don't. And the other major factor there is that Momar Qaddafi, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1164.18s)]
*  he became what's known now as the Libya model. This is the term that's that's often used, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1172.18s)]
*  but Momar Qaddafi essentially got rid of his entire weapons program. And in fact, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1177.54s)]
*  I believe he only attained them to get rid of them. But that's neither here nor there. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1183.62s)]
*  Momar Qaddafi got rid of all his weapons. George W. Bush took it as a victory and said, look what [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1189.22s)]
*  we did, we got Momar Qaddafi to, you know, denuclearize and get rid of his chemical weapons. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1195.3799999999999s)]
*  And then the Obama administration went in there and overthrew his regime. And after having a [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1201.46s)]
*  no fly zone and bombing the crap out of Libya, we allowed a mob of angry Libyans to sodomize him [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1207.06s)]
*  to death, beat and sodomize him to death. It's a pretty tough way to go out. And so this, of course, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1213.62s)]
*  sent a message to everybody involved that you do not want to give up your weapons programs. So we [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1220.34s)]
*  kind of in a true, not just a strategic blunder, because that kind of that doesn't exactly get at [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1227.94s)]
*  it. It's not just like it was an error. We we knew what we were doing. Anybody could have told you [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1236.8200000000002s)]
*  that this would have been the ramification of overthrowing Momar Qaddafi after he had gotten [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1243.38s)]
*  rid of his weapons programs. But we sent a message to the entire world, like anyone who cares about [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1248.74s)]
*  nuclear proliferation or any of that, we sent a message to the entire world that you do not want [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1255.22s)]
*  to get rid of your weapons programs. And in fact, what you want to do is have nuclear weapons. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1260.34s)]
*  And this is something that, by the way, even even though he advocated for this war, when I was [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1264.82s)]
*  debating Douglas Murray on Joe Rogan show, this is one of the concessions that he made that, yes, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1270.9s)]
*  that was a big mistake. That was a big mistake, because now it's incentivized everybody to want [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1274.98s)]
*  to get these weapons. So we did it anyway, even though it would be the worst thing for world peace, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1279.54s)]
*  let alone the worst thing for Libya, you know, and the worst thing for destabilizing that region, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1288.42s)]
*  it was also the worst thing for the migrant crisis into Europe. But just more broadly speaking, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1293.94s)]
*  for world peace, it was the worst thing you could do. But we did it. So Israel could get another [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1300.34s)]
*  regime change that they wanted. So Israel could not have to deal with the pesky little problem [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1307.06s)]
*  of their neighbors objecting to their brutal treatment of the Palestinians. That's what the [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1313.7s)]
*  whole thing is about, including what we're going through right now. And it's what it's all about. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1319.46s)]
*  That's what it's always been about. And, you know, one more thing just on the the nuclear stuff. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1323.86s)]
*  It is wild. This has been one of the wildest aspects to the entire dynamic here is that, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1332.42s)]
*  and I'm not sure everyone knows this, I think most people who talk about this stuff know it, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1337.7s)]
*  but it is really wild, a very wild detail. Now, if you remember, when I was when I was debating, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1342.98s)]
*  that lawyer lady Natasha, I can't remember her last name, or how to say it right. But this is [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1349.86s)]
*  the one where Pierce Morgan just lost his shit on her. And that became kind of the story of the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1357.38s)]
*  the debate that Pierce was just screaming at her that she's just lying through her teeth. But at [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1363.3000000000002s)]
*  one point in the debate, I said to her, and I think some people were like, we're trying to argue some [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1368.5s)]
*  of the like, zio, Twitter accounts, we're trying to argue that I was just asking an irrelevant [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1375.46s)]
*  question. And what did this have to do with the debate? But at one point, I mean, this lady had [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1380.5s)]
*  just lied through her teeth so many times that I just made the point to Pierce that I was like, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1384.26s)]
*  look, she's she's a liar. She won't tell the truth if it makes Israel look bad. And then I asked her, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1388.66s)]
*  I said, Does Israel have nuclear weapons? And then we all laughed as she danced around it and went, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1393.22s)]
*  I don't know any better than you if Israel has nuclear weapons. Now, by the way, just I'm saying [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1398.26s)]
*  some people may not know this. Isn't that already a little strange? Have you ever heard of that [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1403.14s)]
*  before? You ever heard of anyone saying, I don't know if this country has nuclear weapons? We always [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1407.3799999999999s)]
*  kind of know. You know who the nuclear armed countries are and who the non nuclear armed [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1412.9s)]
*  countries are? Well, here's why. Israel has nuclear weapons has had nuclear weapons for [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1417.46s)]
*  many decades. But it's a secret. They don't admit it. Everyone knows they have them. But they sit [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1422.98s)]
*  there and pretend that they don't. And the reason they do that is so they don't have to join the [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1428.74s)]
*  the nonproliferation treaty. So they are not they are the only country that has nuclear weapons, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1434.26s)]
*  won't admit that they have nuclear weapons and won't join the treaty. Iran, on the other hand, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1440.74s)]
*  does not have nuclear weapons and is a member in good standing of the nonproliferation treaty. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1446.26s)]
*  Think about how crazy that is. So Israel is using the defense that they're building a secret nuclear [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1452.1s)]
*  weapon. While Israel is sitting on secret nuclear weapons. Can't make this up. It's too wild. So [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1457.6200000000001s)]
*  all right. Just to be clear here, the the CIA concluded back in 2007, that Iran had given up [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1467.54s)]
*  its nuclear weapons ambitions, and they were not pursuing nuclear weapons. They have reaffirmed [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1478.58s)]
*  that over and over again since there just earlier this year, a couple months ago, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1484.26s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, put out their their annual [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1490.58s)]
*  threat assessment in it. They said same thing. Iran does not have nuclear weapons, is not pursuing [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1494.98s)]
*  nuclear weapons. It with all of the intelligence has been that this is exactly what we've been [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1501.06s)]
*  saying. It's a latent deterrent. They're just enriching uranium. They are enriching uranium [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1506.26s)]
*  beyond their their civilian needs. I forget the exact numbers. I think for for for nuclear energy, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1512.34s)]
*  you need like between three to five percent. I think for some of the medical grade stuff, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1520.82s)]
*  like cancer treatments and things like that, you need like between 25 and 30 percent, something [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1525.1399999999999s)]
*  like this, you could double check the numbers. And they're at like 60%. So there's no question [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1530.1799999999998s)]
*  they're above just what they need. But they're doing it for exactly the reasons I just said, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1534.34s)]
*  they want to be close enough that they could get a new like if they get attacked like this, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1538.1s)]
*  they want to be able to develop a nuclear weapon in a hurry. But they don't have the new they don't [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1542.1s)]
*  have one single nuclear weapon. So Benjamin Netanyahu was interviewed last night by Brett [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1546.66s)]
*  Bayer and even Benjamin Netanyahu, Brett Bayer asks him, you know, Brett Bayer is he's he's good [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1558.66s)]
*  for at least pretending to be a journalist. So he'll ask like a couple tough questions, but [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1565.38s)]
*  there'll be no tough follow up questions and he'll let you get away with whatever you say afterward. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1570.1000000000001s)]
*  But he asked Netanyahu straight up, he said, he said, well, look, all of our intelligence is [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1574.34s)]
*  saying that they don't have nuclear weapons and that they're not trying to get them. So like, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1579.9399999999998s)]
*  did you did Israel get some new intelligence? Is something new that way? And he didn't even [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1584.6599999999999s)]
*  have an answer. He just went, well, yes, we think they're going to get and then at one point, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1592.02s)]
*  he said, maybe they're 12 to 13 months away. So again, just to be clear, the guy who's been [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1596.66s)]
*  lying through his teeth about how far away from a weapon Iran is, I mean, he was saying one to [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1605.3000000000002s)]
*  three years in the 90s. So now he's saying one year plus even that even he's not claiming they [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1610.26s)]
*  got nuclear weapons, or they were about to get nuclear weapons from his own from from the horse's [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1616.8200000000002s)]
*  mouth. He's saying that maybe in a year they could have gotten them. Okay, now another thing [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1623.3s)]
*  that's an important detail here is that Iran can't get nuclear weapons without us knowing [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1629.3s)]
*  that they're getting nuclear weapons. So it's not as if this was just going to be a surprise, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1635.54s)]
*  we would know that they're pursuing them. But even Benjamin Netanyahu is not claiming that they have [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1639.86s)]
*  some intelligence that we don't have. So you might wonder, why did he attack right now? Why did he [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1645.86s)]
*  attack when Iran was in the middle of negotiations with the United States of America, and Donald [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1652.5s)]
*  Trump had publicly asked him not to do this? Now, that's where we get into a little bit more of an [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1658.18s)]
*  interesting kind of detail in all of this. So essentially, Donald Trump, Netanyahu said also [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1665.38s)]
*  in this interview, that that Donald Trump was well aware of the attack, well aware that Israel was [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1673.62s)]
*  going to attack, and that he had approved it. Donald, okay, after Israel attacked Iran, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1680.82s)]
*  after the attack, then there was reporting that essentially, not only did Donald Trump know this, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1692.74s)]
*  but Donald Trump was in on it. And that the negotiating was all a fake, basically, so that [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1700.34s)]
*  Iran wouldn't see this attack coming, so that they were like coordinating and working together. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1707.3s)]
*  So this is what Netanyahu and other reports are saying. On the other hand, Tucker Carlson was on [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1712.34s)]
*  with Steve Bannon yesterday, and he said that he knows for a fact, this is absolutely not true, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1719.54s)]
*  and that they're lying. And that Witkoff and Donald Trump were negotiating in good faith, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1725.54s)]
*  and that they really wanted to avoid this war and come to some type of nuclear agreement, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1730.74s)]
*  some type of new Obama-Iran deal, but I suppose this one would be a little bit tougher or something [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1738.1s)]
*  that Donald Trump could find a way to justify tearing up the last agreement only to go back [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1744.18s)]
*  to the negotiating table to try to get a new agreement. But that's what Tucker's claiming. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1750.1s)]
*  Now, I don't know what's true and what's not in that. I trust Tucker Carlson a lot more than I [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1754.74s)]
*  trust Benjamin Netanyahu, but just to be clear, there's really only a couple of options here. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1763.06s)]
*  And I'm open to if someone wants to point out an option, something I'm missing here, then you tell [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1770.98s)]
*  me. But the point is that either Netanyahu is telling the truth here, or Tucker Carlson's [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1774.82s)]
*  telling the truth here. Now, if Benjamin Netanyahu is telling the truth here, then we're at war with [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1782.74s)]
*  Iran right now. If Tucker Carlson is telling the truth here, we're at war with Iran right now. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1788.74s)]
*  Either way. It's funny because I'm sure as you see some of the Israel supporters just gloating [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1794.98s)]
*  and celebrating, we could get into that a bit more because there's so much hypocrisy that's [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1803.78s)]
*  going on from all of them. But it's so funny because they're in this position of defending [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1810.42s)]
*  the indefensible. They're defending Israel who just launched just a cowardly sneak attack, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1816.18s)]
*  an act of aggression, a preemptive war. So a war of choice, a war of aggression in a sneak attack. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1826.42s)]
*  They just Pearl Harbored Iran. But somehow we're supposed to view this as what their [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1835.22s)]
*  justification will be. And this is what they'll almost to a man what they'll all say is that, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1842.58s)]
*  well, no, this was a defensive action because Iran started the war on October 7th when their proxy, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1847.94s)]
*  Hamas, launched a terrorist attack against Israel. But if you'll notice, this is always the case when [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1855.94s)]
*  the Warhawks talk about Iran. They'll assert these things, but they never have to actually [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1863.7s)]
*  back it up with any facts. Like you may have noticed, you may have heard when the Hawks are [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1869.3s)]
*  talking about Iran, they'll quite often say that Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1874.26s)]
*  But you might notice what they never do is back that up with anything factual. Like, and by the [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1883.38s)]
*  way, I'm not arguing that Iran does not sell weapons and even collaborate with terrorist [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1889.78s)]
*  organizations. I'm not arguing that. But they say Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1898.02s)]
*  And it's like, okay, so where's the measurement for that? Have you ever seen anyone sit down and [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1904.18s)]
*  say, look, this is how much Saudi Arabia gives to terrorist organizations. And this is how much [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1909.1399999999999s)]
*  Iran gives to terrorist organizations. Have you ever seen anyone measure how much the US gives [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1913.94s)]
*  to terrorist organizations? How much Israel gives to terrorist organizations? And by the way, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1919.46s)]
*  this is before I'm even playing the game of how do you define terrorism? Because there's a pretty [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1924.74s)]
*  strong argument that what Israel's done in Gaza over the last 21 months has been terrorist in [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1930.58s)]
*  nature. There's a strong argument that what America did in shock and awe to Iraq was terrorist in [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1935.78s)]
*  nature. But leaving all of that aside, I'm talking like organizations that we'd all agree are [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1941.94s)]
*  terrorists like Al Qaeda or ISIS. How much support have they gotten from the US, from Israel, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1946.58s)]
*  from Saudi Arabia, from Turkey? But no one even measures it. They just assert Iran is the one. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1953.3799999999999s)]
*  But okay, fine. Let's just say that's true. So Iran, now Hamas is an Iranian proxy. Now, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1958.98s)]
*  what do they have to prove? When they say that Iran, and of course, you know, this isn't just [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1968.1799999999998s)]
*  like random people saying this, like senators, Lindsey Graham called for us to bomb Iran on [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1973.14s)]
*  October 8th, like right after October 7th. He said we should be attacking Iran right now. This is a [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1979.3000000000002s)]
*  long sitting member of the Senate in America was calling for a war because of October 7th. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1985.6200000000001s)]
*  Now, what do they have to demonstrate in order to claim that Iran was at war with Israel? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1992.5800000000002s)]
*  Do they have to demonstrate that Iran was in on the planning of October 7th? Because I've seen, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=1999.7s)]
*  you know, I've argued with people again, not just random people on Twitter, but people like in the [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2006.74s)]
*  media with big followings. And they're like, I just mentioned senators and congressmen and all types [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2011.7s)]
*  of people have made this argument. Our intelligence, the best US intelligence said that Iran was was [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2017.1399999999999s)]
*  caught off guard was shocked by October 7th, but they had no knowledge of it. But then the response [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2025.06s)]
*  to that will be like, well, what did they think those weapons were going to do? Huh? They still [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2030.26s)]
*  gave weapons to Hamas, which I, you know, again, I'm sure at some point, Iran has sold some weapons [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2034.1799999999998s)]
*  to Hamas. I don't really know how much there's there's been a full blockade around that country [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2040.74s)]
*  since 2007. So I don't know how much but you know, look, we get weapons into federal prisons in the [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2045.86s)]
*  United States of America and you know, some weapons get into Gaza as well. Maybe Iran has [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2052.98s)]
*  given them something substantial. Again, no one ever really seems to try to back up these claims. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2059.86s)]
*  They certainly were selling weapons to Hezbollah. They certainly have sold some weapons to the [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2064.58s)]
*  Houthis and sure, maybe they gave some weapons to Hamas also. But notice here, the criteria is that [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2068.18s)]
*  they didn't have to have any knowledge of October 7th. They didn't have to be a part of the planning [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2075.78s)]
*  of October 7th. They didn't have to be a part of the execution of October 7th. They gave weapons [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2081.54s)]
*  to Hamas and then Hamas did October 7th and that's enough. That's enough to say Iran is at war with [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2086.74s)]
*  Israel. Okay. Well, if that's true, then what is Israel attacking Iran other than the U.S. being at [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2092.58s)]
*  war with Iran? And again, the case is much stronger for the U.S. being at war because it's not, look, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2100.1s)]
*  according to Netanyahu, if what he's saying is true, then we expressly greenlit this operation. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2109.06s)]
*  So not only was it done with our weapons, a country that we prop up with our weapons, attacked them, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2116.42s)]
*  but that if what Netanyahu is saying is true, that we were using the negotiations to help them sneak [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2122.5s)]
*  attack them. Now look, I don't exactly know whether Netanyahu is telling the truth. These reports are [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2129.62s)]
*  true or whether Tucker Carlson's right. I don't think Tucker Carlson's lying. It is possible that [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2135.78s)]
*  people are lying to him and he's believing the lies, but either way, if what Netanyahu is saying [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2140.42s)]
*  is true, then not only are we a part of this, but we were like an active part in the most [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2148.1000000000004s)]
*  shameful way, pretending to want negotiations, just setting them up for another war. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2157.78s)]
*  It doesn't really help, at least as far as I'm seeing this, it doesn't help Tucker Carlson's [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2166.6600000000003s)]
*  claim that we were evacuating people in the region 24 to 48 hours before the attack came. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2172.6600000000003s)]
*  So if nothing else, there seems to be like knowledge, prior knowledge, before the fact, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2180.5800000000004s)]
*  which is what Netanyahu is claiming. So maybe that's it. But look, I mean, imagine that, right? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2186.5800000000004s)]
*  Imagine that not only was the claim that Hamas was a proxy of Iran, but imagine that the Iranians [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2192.58s)]
*  had been in negotiations with the Israelis and then quietly, 24 hours before October 7th, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2207.2999999999997s)]
*  pulled their people out of the region. And then after pulling off October 7th, the Hamas leaders [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2213.2999999999997s)]
*  came out and said, Yep, Iran had our back. They knew we were going to do it. This was all a setup [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2220.74s)]
*  to get Israel. We would have already gone to war with Iran over that. So like, again, as I always [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2225.54s)]
*  kind of insist with these things, it's funny because the Israel supporters will accuse us of [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2232.5s)]
*  moral relativism. But the entire time, I'm always saying, what is the objective standard here? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2237.8599999999997s)]
*  What is the objective standard? We can't have one standard for when Iran is at war and a completely [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2244.2599999999998s)]
*  different standard for when we're at war. If there is an object, if we're rejecting relativism [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2250.18s)]
*  and we're having an objective standard here by any objective standard, we are at war with Iran. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2254.58s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Massa [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2261.7s)]
*  Chips. Did you know that all chips and fries used to be cooked in tallow up until the 1990s when big [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2265.94s)]
*  corporations switched to cheap processed seed oils? Today, seed oils make up to 20% of the average [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2274.26s)]
*  Americans daily calories. And recent studies have linked seed oils to metabolic health issues and [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2281.0600000000004s)]
*  inflammation in the body. This is something Bobby Kennedy has talked a lot about. But now Massa [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2286.7400000000002s)]
*  has decided to do something about it. They've created a tasty and delicious tortilla chip [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2291.5400000000004s)]
*  with just three ingredients and no seed oils. These chips don't only avoid all the bad stuff, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2296.0200000000004s)]
*  they taste incredible too. Massa is crunchier, tastier and sturdier than other chips. It's not [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2301.78s)]
*  going to break under your salsa or guac or whatever you like eating. Go check them out. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2307.0600000000004s)]
*  Massa chips are beloved by tens of thousands of customers and have been endorsed by industry [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2311.78s)]
*  leading health and nutrition experts like Ben Greenfield and Gary Brekka. If you're ready to [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2317.3s)]
*  give Massa a try, go to massachips.com slash Dave and use the promo code Dave for 25% off your first [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2322.5800000000004s)]

*  let's get back into the show. Now, let's just explore for a second here. If let's say the Tucker [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2339.38s)]
*  Carlson angle is right. Let's say that which, you know, certain things are kind of hard to explain, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2347.46s)]
*  but if what Tucker, like it certainly is plausible that Israel would go ahead and do this even without [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2355.06s)]
*  Donald Trump's support. I mean, they've always been kind of their game is always to lure America [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2361.86s)]
*  into their next war. And so maybe this was it that they just felt like they'd put Trump in this [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2366.34s)]
*  position and then he'd have no choice. So let's explore that scenario, which maybe there's a [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2370.9s)]
*  third one that I'm missing here, but it seems like it's got to be one of these two. So let's say, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2376.9s)]
*  as Tucker Carlson says, that Donald Trump and Steve Witkoff were negotiating in good faith. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2383.0600000000004s)]
*  They wanted to get a deal done. They wanted to avoid this war. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2389.5400000000004s)]
*  And then Israel sabotaged them. Okay, so they're just to understand here, they were in negotiations [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2394.98s)]
*  with the Iranians. There was a meeting set the day after Israel attacked. The next day, the Iranians [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2403.7000000000003s)]
*  were supposed to be meeting negotiating with the Trump administration. So then Israel attacks, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2411.78s)]
*  destroying the possibility of negotiations, at least it seems. There are reports today that [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2417.86s)]
*  Iran still wants to negotiate, but I just I have a feeling we're past that point. I hope I'm wrong [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2423.6200000000003s)]
*  and I hope this does end in a very short war that ends in negotiations. That would be great. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2430.34s)]
*  But let's just say, let's say that Israel, keep in mind, by the way, that after bending over [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2436.02s)]
*  backward for Netanyahu in his first administration, Netanyahu, I mean, literally doing things that no [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2442.5s)]
*  other president has ever done for the Israelis, moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2448.98s)]
*  and you understand why that's such a provocative thing that the Israelis have wanted for so long, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2453.7799999999997s)]
*  because the the two state solution, going back to the Oslo Accords was supposed to be based around [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2458.98s)]
*  1967 borders. And when people say 1967 borders, they mean before the Six Day War in 1967. So the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2466.66s)]
*  borders that held from 1948 until 1967. So those borders would split Jerusalem with East with East [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2474.7400000000002s)]
*  Jerusalem being a part of the new Palestinian state with East Jerusalem in the West Bank [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2484.42s)]
*  and Gaza being the Palestinian state. So the significance of putting the embassy in Jerusalem [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2489.46s)]
*  or of Israel calling Jerusalem its capital, rather than Tel Aviv, is that there is it's a signal that [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2496.6600000000003s)]
*  you're never getting your Palestinian state, much like the settlements in the West Bank. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2502.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like, hey, if we're going to give them a state, then what are how come we're building [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2507.94s)]
*  these giant settlements on the territory that's supposed to be their state? So Donald Trump moves [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2510.66s)]
*  the embassy to Jerusalem. Donald Trump gets the Abraham Accords through basically bribes the [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2516.2599999999998s)]
*  surrounding Arab countries to recognize Israel and enter into, you know, normal relations with them, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2523.94s)]
*  bribes them with taxpayer money to do that. He does everything he can kill Soleimani. You know, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2530.02s)]
*  just the most pro-Israel president you could possibly be. And yet Benjamin Netanyahu was the [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2536.3399999999997s)]
*  first one to throw Donald Trump under the bus and congratulate Joe Biden for winning the 2020 election [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2543.7s)]
*  before American media had even called the race for Joe Biden. Forget the weeks and months afterward [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2550.1s)]
*  where Trump was contesting the election and bringing court cases. Obviously, all of them failed, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2556.58s)]
*  but that wasn't clear at the time. Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Joe Biden for winning [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2562.18s)]
*  before the American media was even calling the race. After everything Donald Trump did, the guy [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2569.3799999999997s)]
*  turned around and stabbed him in the back. And so now, again, we're operating under the Tucker [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2575.22s)]
*  Carlson model here. Now you're telling me that Donald Trump was in the middle of negotiations [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2578.98s)]
*  and Israel started a war that Trump was trying to avoid. And then they went out and lied about it [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2585.22s)]
*  and said, no, no, no, he was in on it the whole time. And Donald Trump doesn't correct the record, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2593.62s)]
*  doesn't come out and say, no, no, no, they're lying, guys. I was negotiating. I did not want [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2599.54s)]
*  this war. Doesn't, like, if that were true, then the only way to be a leader after that would come [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2603.9399999999996s)]
*  out, state that for the record, condemn Israel's aggressive attack of Iran and say, no, we are [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2610.34s)]
*  going back to negotiating right now. And now whatever. Now we're not negotiating favorably [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2616.5s)]
*  with Israel or something like that. But he didn't. He because essentially that would just make him [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2621.6200000000003s)]
*  look weak. That would make him look weak because he something was done to him against his will. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2627.54s)]
*  That has now totally changed the calculation and made peace much more difficult to attain. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2634.9s)]
*  So if that's true, if the Tucker Carlson, you know, model, whatever you want to call it, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2640.58s)]
*  if Tucker Carlson is right, when he says he knows for a fact that Trump and what cough were [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2646.02s)]
*  negotiating in good faith and we're not covering for the Israelis, then Donald Trump is allowing [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2650.6600000000003s)]
*  that to be the narrative. It's actually even worse for Donald Trump than he is the most impotent [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2657.06s)]
*  Howard of a leader that he wouldn't even go out and correct the record to potentially avoid [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2662.02s)]
*  World War three. Like to do like in the worst case scenario, avoid World War three in a better case [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2667.22s)]
*  scenario, avoid a catastrophic war in the Middle East. And beyond that, just to tell the truth, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2675.06s)]
*  just to not allow the Israelis to dog walk you into the policy they want. So you got two options [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2681.06s)]
*  here. Either way, it's a disastrous failure from Donald Trump. And that just really can't be [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2687.38s)]
*  overstated. And so that is why I said earlier today on breaking points that I'm, you know, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2696.02s)]
*  not that I was ever really on it or whatever, but I'm just to be, I'm officially jumping off the Trump [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2704.82s)]
*  train here. I think it, I just think the guy, if he ever did deserve our support, he no longer does. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2709.86s)]
*  This was a, this was, and I know Donald Trump was always, you know, Israel's lap dog. And I know [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2717.7000000000003s)]
*  that he was always, would always, you know, was terrible on Iran, terrible on Israel, was always, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2725.94s)]
*  you know, would talk in this blustery language. But at the very core of Donald Trump's pitch [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2731.86s)]
*  was that I do that so we don't fight wars. This is what all of his supporters bragged throughout the, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2737.7000000000003s)]
*  you know, his first administration and the four years after that there were no new wars under [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2744.9s)]
*  Donald Trump, no new wars in the middle East. Well, that's over now. And then all this talk [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2749.3s)]
*  about how Russia wouldn't have dared done it had I been president or Hamas wouldn't have dared to do [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2754.98s)]
*  it if I had been president. Israel dare do it. Israel seems to be more emboldened by the fact [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2760.5s)]
*  that Donald Trump's president than they've ever been about anything else. I mean, this is a war [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2769.6200000000003s)]
*  that they've wanted for at least the last 30 years. And they only felt emboldened to do it now. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2773.94s)]
*  So I just, I don't know what, what I can say other than that's just, that's it. That's it for me. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2780.9s)]
*  I mean, look, Donald Trump for all the stuff he's, he's been through. And of course, I say this just [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2789.14s)]
*  in principle, I believe me, I know how corrupt the Congress is. I know this will never happen. They [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2797.3s)]
*  actually probably love this about Donald Trump, you know, for all the people who hate Donald Trump, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2802.34s)]
*  and I mean, the people in power, not like someone you know, but say like all the people at CNN, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2806.6600000000003s)]
*  or MSNBC, or the New York Times, or the Washington Post, or in the Democratic establishment, or the [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2812.82s)]
*  Republican establishment, all the people in the CIA, or the FBI, or all of them, right? For all, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2819.3s)]
*  as much as they've hated Donald Trump for the last eight, nine years, they like this. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2824.58s)]
*  You won't, you won't see any impeachment attempts from the leadership, at least maybe like some rogue [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2830.98s)]
*  elements, but you're not going to see like, you know, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer leading [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2837.46s)]
*  impeachment hearings over this. But this is actually the thing Donald Trump should be impeached [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2842.5800000000004s)]
*  for. He should be impeached and removed for this, because either of those two things, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2847.38s)]
*  either of those two scenarios is just unforgivable. He should, if he had an ounce of integrity, he'd [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2852.26s)]
*  resign himself right now. Let JD Vance get in there. Let's see if maybe he's got a backbone. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2859.46s)]
*  But if Donald Trump literally tried to not only fool the Iranians, but fool his own supporters [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2865.14s)]
*  into thinking that he was negotiating for peace, and then encouraged in a legal war of aggression [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2873.86s)]
*  by the Israelis, then he should be impeached and removed. And if he didn't, and Israel, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2881.78s)]
*  and Israel has sabotaged the United States of America, and a country who is our welfare queen, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2888.3399999999997s)]
*  a country whose wars we fight for them, whose weapons we supply to them, who we give them [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2897.62s)]
*  $4 billion a year just for existing, not to mention the $3 billion a year we give Egypt to [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2903.7799999999997s)]
*  never fight them, or the billions of dollars that we've given to Jordan to never fight them, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2910.4199999999996s)]
*  or the billions of dollars we give to Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates to never fight [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2914.66s)]
*  Israel, all that we've given them, that they would go out of their way to sabotage our peace talks, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2919.54s)]
*  and then our president would sit there and take it and not correct the record, that's even worse. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2926.1s)]
*  To be honest, that's even worse. Either way, he should actually be impeached and removed for [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2932.66s)]
*  this. Of course, he won't be. He'll be impeached for a phone call with Zelensky or, you know, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2937.8599999999997s)]
*  whatever, January 6th or something like that for the nonsense. The thing is that this is what they [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2943.7s)]
*  actually like about Donald Trump. Look, I hope that, you know, there's, as I've been saying some [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2948.98s)]
*  stuff like this, both on breaking points and on Twitter today, there's been a lot of people who [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2957.9399999999996s)]
*  say that I'm overreacting, wait and see, we'll see what happens here. I hope you're right. I hope [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2962.4199999999996s)]
*  you're right. I hope I'm wrong. This is still too far for me. I'm off the Trump train, if ever I was [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2971.06s)]
*  really on it. I was hopeful at one point. But I hope you're right. I hope that the Iranians were [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2978.42s)]
*  signaling today that they were ready to negotiate, which I was surprised by. I thought it was going [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2986.42s)]
*  to be too late for that. But then again, I mean, we just saw one of two things happen here. Either [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=2992.9s)]
*  Donald Trump never really wanted to negotiate with the Iranians, or he did, and Israel sabotaged it. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3001.38s)]
*  So why should we think negotiations are going to happen now? I guess a couple other notes that I [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3010.02s)]
*  would say here, it has been wild. It's almost like you stepped in some type of time machine, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3016.1800000000003s)]
*  and I'm back in 2002, listening to the same people use the same justifications that were used [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3022.34s)]
*  to launch the invasion of Iraq. I mean, literally the exact same people. Listen, I'm seeing Marc [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3030.82s)]
*  Levin and Glenn Beck all telling me how we'll be greeted as liberators. Oh, will we really? No, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3035.7000000000003s)]
*  you don't understand. They were developing weapons of mass destruction. Okay. All right. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3041.86s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3047.22s)]

*  next one. That's the lie you guys told us last time you were duping us into fighting a war on [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3102.82s)]
*  Israel's behalf. You got to find a new one for this time. It's appalling and I got to say, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3108.1800000000003s)]
*  kind of shocking to see how many people were celebrating this immediately. Celebrating how [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3118.34s)]
*  easy it was, how successful Israel was before it's even clear. Before it's even clear how much [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3124.42s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program has even been degraded. It's just very unclear right now. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3132.82s)]
*  How many people have died. Very unclear right now. I think they were reporting like 70 people [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3137.46s)]
*  were killed with several hundred being wounded out of Iran, but we still haven't even, the dust [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3144.02s)]
*  hasn't even settled. We don't exactly know. And they're celebrating. See, this was easy. Here's [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3148.42s)]
*  a video. I saw one person post a video of what looked to be about 25 Iranians cheering and they [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3155.54s)]
*  were like, look, the people are ready to rise up. Yeah, it's like, I remember them saying the same [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3162.58s)]
*  thing about Saddam Hussein, but at least there were like thousands of people in those videos. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3168.58s)]
*  But there, you know, this is, this is how wars always work. Every single war, my entire life, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3173.14s)]
*  every war was like this. I remember, went in, you know, I think I've told this on the show before, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3181.86s)]
*  but I had, I have a memory, you know, I was a little kid. I was born in 1983. So it was in 1991 [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3188.9s)]
*  that George H.W. Bush launched the Gulf War and invaded Iraq for the first time. I remember his [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3196.26s)]
*  address to the nation when he announced that we were invading. And I remember, you know, vaguely [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3201.06s)]
*  from the time, but I've read about this as an adult, but I remember the celebration after the [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3207.94s)]
*  Gulf War in the one in 91 I'm talking about now. And everybody was just celebrating how easy it was. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3212.98s)]
*  I mean, we went right in there and just steamrolled them. It was a cakewalk. We didn't take casualties, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3220.02s)]
*  some injuries. I don't think America took any casualties in that war. I might be wrong, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3227.14s)]
*  but if there were, they were very low in number. And that was it. We were celebrating how easy it [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3232.02s)]
*  was. It was such an easy success, you know, cakewalk. Except we went on to be militarily bogged down in [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3237.78s)]
*  that country for the next 30 years. You know, there were massive sanctions and bombing campaigns all [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3246.98s)]
*  through the Clinton years of Iraq. In fact, it was one of the things that was one of the stated [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3253.2200000000003s)]
*  grievances in Osama bin Laden's declaration of war on the West was how many babies we killed in Iraq. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3257.6200000000003s)]
*  And we were we were bogged down there throughout the 90s. Of course, after 9 11, they launched the [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3265.06s)]
*  George W. Bush's war there. That went on to be another 20 year catastrophe. It was 30 years of [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3270.42s)]
*  fighting after that. It was really easy to celebrate how easy it is at the time. Of course, everybody [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3275.6200000000003s)]
*  remembers famously that only a couple months into George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq, he had a mission [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3281.54s)]
*  accomplished celebration where he came in on a fighter jet and they had the big mission accomplished [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3288.1800000000003s)]
*  banner behind him and everyone's celebrating what an easy what an easy victory it had been. See, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3293.22s)]
*  we got Saddam out of there and then we went on to be embroiled in a 20 year catastrophic civil war [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3298.1s)]
*  where something like a million people died. I remember right after Muammar Gaddafi was [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3305.62s)]
*  overthrown is when Hillary Clinton had her famous we came we saw he's dead. They were all planning [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3312.8199999999997s)]
*  about how this was going to be the centerpiece of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3320.02s)]
*  She was Secretary of State. They called it Hillary's war. She was the one who really pushed [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3327.86s)]
*  to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi in Obama's memoir. He said that he was about 50 50 on the issue and [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3332.9s)]
*  that Hillary Clinton was the one who convinced him. She was bragging about it and they wanted [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3338.5s)]
*  to have something. Hillary Clinton had fame again, I might be a little bit older than some of you [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3343.2200000000003s)]
*  guys, but I remember this stuff. But in the 90s, when Hillary Clinton was the first lady, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3348.66s)]
*  she was put in charge of health care. She was going to sell the new health care reform and it [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3353.3799999999997s)]
*  failed. And so she was just kind of remembered for this policy failure. She really had nothing [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3359.7s)]
*  as a senator. She voted for the war in Iraq, which was a disaster. She didn't really have anything [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3364.8199999999997s)]
*  that she could say like this was my you know, she always Hillary Clinton always tried to run [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3369.46s)]
*  on like I'm the professional one. I'm the one with experience. I'm you know, all this shit, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3374.26s)]
*  but she didn't have anything to hang her hat on. And so they thought this would be it. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3379.6200000000003s)]
*  The Libya model, you see, she let a regime change, you know, one of the countries that Israel wanted [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3383.2200000000003s)]
*  us to get rid of, but she didn't do it with boots on the ground the way that George W. Bush did. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3389.7000000000003s)]
*  These days, this is how the Democrats were trying to sell themselves. Like we're the party of war, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3394.34s)]
*  but we're for smart wars. We don't just send our troops in and get, you know, boggled down in a [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3398.5s)]
*  nation building project. We just took out the leader, you know, so that was their plan. They [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3404.98s)]
*  were going to run on Libya in her presidential campaign. By the time she was running for [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3409.38s)]
*  president, she wouldn't dare bring up Libya. She wouldn't even mention it because it was so obviously [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3415.22s)]
*  a colossal failure at that point. I'm sure a lot of you guys can remember because I'm not going that [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3420.42s)]
*  far back now, but when Vladimir Putin first invaded Ukraine, Joe Biden said we would defeat [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3426.26s)]
*  them with sanctions alone. We wouldn't even have to send in weapons to the Ukrainians. We could just [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3431.94s)]
*  sanction Russia right out of Ukraine. How'd that work out? You know, hundreds of billions of [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3437.2200000000003s)]
*  dollars of weapons later and Russia's got more territory than they had then. So for people who [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3444.5800000000004s)]
*  are celebrating how easy and successful this war was 48 hours into the war, these people are out [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3450.82s)]
*  of their fucking minds. Like you can't look back at the last 25 years and go, at least I shouldn't [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3458.42s)]
*  be celebrating yet. Now, maybe I'll be wrong. Maybe I'll be proven wrong in all of this. Perhaps it [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3464.6600000000003s)]
*  is true that Iran is a better candidate for regime change than these other countries. I've heard that [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3471.46s)]
*  argument made and I must admit there's not nothing to it. You know, Iran has a different history, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3478.98s)]
*  a different level of sophistication, a different tradition in liberalism than a lot of these other [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3487.78s)]
*  countries do. There's the the Shah who was installed by the U.S. after we overthrew Mosadaik in 1953, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3493.7s)]
*  who was a democratically elected leader, by the way. But he didn't want to do business with British [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3504.02s)]
*  oil companies and so the CIA went in and overthrew him. And we installed the Shah and from 1953 to [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3509.38s)]
*  1979, Iran was a much different country than it's been since then. And there, you know, some of you [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3515.86s)]
*  guys may have seen, but like they'll show you pictures of like Iran in 1971 and there's women [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3521.94s)]
*  in miniskirts and there's cities and there's, you know, and then after the revolution in 79, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3528.26s)]
*  it became a much more repressive society. Still in big cities in Iran, there are nightclubs and [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3534.5s)]
*  there are, you know, like there's the argument is that there's a liberalism to their culture [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3540.6600000000003s)]
*  that you don't find in others. And listen, I suppose I'll say perhaps that finally this time [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3546.5800000000004s)]
*  and for the first time, the Warhawks are actually right about this and this will be easy and they [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3555.86s)]
*  will overthrow the regime and it will just be a much better situation. But I'm doubtful. I've just [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3561.2200000000003s)]
*  seen this movie play out many times before. And, you know, there's a lot of bluster right now. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3568.02s)]
*  There's a lot of people talking about how weak the Iranian regime is. And so Netanyahu was saying to [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3574.9s)]
*  Brett Baier the other day, they always say this when they're trying to get us to war, oh, they're [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3582.02s)]
*  so weak. It'll be so easy to go just overthrow them because again, make no mistake about it. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3585.78s)]
*  This is about regime change. This is about getting the seventh country on Wesley Clark's list. It's [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3590.7400000000002s)]
*  not about a non-existent nuclear weapons program. There are other things that are also different [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3596.1s)]
*  about Iran. And I think Israel's already felt that. Like one of the things that's pretty different [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3603.14s)]
*  about Iran is that when we went in to take out Saddam Hussein, when we went in to take out [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3610.42s)]
*  Muammar Gaddafi, when we went in to overthrow the Taliban, when we went into overthrow Bashar Al-Assad, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3617.06s)]
*  they didn't, they weren't able to bomb the crap out of Israel in response. They certainly weren't [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3624.1s)]
*  able to bomb the United States of America in response. Iran has already demonstrated, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3630.34s)]
*  while all of these people are celebrating, Iran has already demonstrated that they can touch Israel. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3636.18s)]
*  And I don't think they've emptied out everything they have yet because nobody's claiming that. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3642.02s)]
*  It should also be pointed out here that immediately, and this is what I mean when I say the US is [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3647.54s)]
*  already at war with Iran, immediately that we have US armed forces shooting down the Iranian missiles. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3652.66s)]
*  So think about that too as just one more example of how we're at war with them. Imagine you either [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3662.26s)]
*  allow slash facilitate or possibly didn't want but will still make excuses for [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3669.3s)]
*  Israel's aggressive attack of Iran. And then you're shooting down the missiles coming back [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3678.02s)]
*  in the other direction, protecting them. So I don't know, how is that not being at war with that country? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3683.5400000000004s)]
*  And so, you know, they could sit here and say that this regime is weak. The people really hate them. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3692.02s)]
*  They don't have any popular support. You know, 80% of the people oppose this regime. All the [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3698.5800000000004s)]
*  numbers that they say, again, like with all their claims about Iran, they never have to show their [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3703.6200000000003s)]
*  work. They never have to demonstrate how they concluded this. The fact of the matter is that [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3706.98s)]
*  this regime has stood since 1979. Now, if they were so weak, you know, and okay, this regime has [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3712.8199999999997s)]
*  stood since 1979 with the most powerful governments in the world wanting them out, and they've still [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3723.14s)]
*  stayed in. I don't think I'm buying this argument that they're going to be so easy to topple. And [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3730.1s)]
*  once again, as the military told George W. Bush in 2007, we do not have escalation dominance in a [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3736.18s)]
*  war with Iran. Meaning, you know, escalation dominance is the military term that basically [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3744.58s)]
*  means we're going to do this. Now, once we do this, they could either do this or this or this. If they [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3750.74s)]
*  do this, we do this. If they do this, we do this. If they do this, we do this. This is the type of [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3755.7799999999997s)]
*  dominance we had over Saddam Hussein's Iraq. And when I say that, I don't mean what everybody knows [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3760.02s)]
*  we got bogged down in Iraq was in nation building. It was after we overthrew Saddam Hussein. Then [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3765.14s)]
*  we had this civil war breakout. We fought on one side of the civil war. There was resistance from [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3772.5s)]
*  the other side of civil war. We're trying to hold regular elections. We're trying to impose a new [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3777.46s)]
*  government. The country's in flames. Al Qaeda comes in to join up with the resistance. Now we [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3781.7s)]
*  got these fighters who were fighting an insurgency. That's where the war in Iraq gets really messy. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3786.5s)]
*  That's where a million people die. That's where we're in the 20 year regime change war. But just [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3791.38s)]
*  the war with Saddam Hussein's government was a cakewalk. You know, we went in there and whatever [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3795.78s)]
*  they did, we had 10 times more power. You know, they do this, we send them the Air Force. They do [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3802.42s)]
*  this, we send them the Navy. They like we'd always be able to take out their next option. What the [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3806.58s)]
*  Pentagon was telling George W. Bush in 2007 is that we don't have that with Iran. Like, we don't [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3811.1400000000003s)]
*  have that. You know, it's like, okay, we bombed their nuclear facilities, then they could touch [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3817.06s)]
*  any one of our bases or embassies in the region. And we just have tens of thousands of US military [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3822.2599999999998s)]
*  personnel all throughout the region. You know, I mean, we have the bases in Iraq and Bahrain and [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3829.06s)]
*  in Qatar, all over the place. We have US bases that they can touch, not to mention Israel's [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3834.5s)]
*  right there as well. And to see, you know, the same people who have championed war after war [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3839.46s)]
*  after war, every one of them being a catastrophic failure, now out here, saying, no, no, no, this [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3847.86s)]
*  one's easy. It's like, I just would not, I'm looking at this thing, I would not take their [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3854.9s)]
*  word for it. And I hope I'm wrong. I hope Donald Trump pulls a Trump card out of his ass and gets [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3858.66s)]
*  back to the negotiating table and we can somehow avoid this calamity. But as of now, I am just not [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3865.22s)]
*  seeing it. It does not look good, if you're asking me. And I do think that no matter what, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3871.62s)]
*  this has been a total betrayal of America First and of MAGA by Donald Trump. And, you know, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3878.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm kind of sick of people making excuses for him. You know, Donald Trump has had some of the [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3886.1s)]
*  biggest tests of his life. He has absolutely failed. Then COVID was the first one was the [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3891.86s)]
*  biggest test of his life. He championed lockdowns. He mocked places that weren't locking down, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3897.7000000000003s)]
*  made predictions about places and countries like Sweden, how they were going to like regret that [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3903.6200000000003s)]
*  they didn't have lockdowns. Meanwhile, they did great through COVID, did substantially better [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3908.5s)]
*  than their neighbors. Donald Trump kept Fauci on the job through all of 2020, bragged about [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3914.5s)]
*  the awful vaccine, you know, not even getting into his foreign policy decisions, like how much [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3923.14s)]
*  just how much death and destruction is on this guy's hands. And look, I know, I supported him [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3929.78s)]
*  this time around. It really did seem at the time like he was a much better option. In some ways, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3936.34s)]
*  I'm sure he still was a much better option than Kamala Harris. And I still tend to think looking [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3942.02s)]
*  back at it, that it would have been worse for the country for her to win overall. But this is just, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3948.42s)]
*  you know, this is the second major test of Donald Trump's life. And he's just failing it [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3953.78s)]
*  miserably. And I have no role in any of this, if not to tell the truth. And I'm just not, you know, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3957.62s)]
*  I understand where people who are real close to the president and want to influence him still feel [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3964.58s)]
*  like they got to kind of kiss his ass while blaming everyone else around him. But that's not me. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3969.38s)]
*  At a certain point, it's like now this is on him. It's his fault. He's got he's had enough good [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3975.78s)]
*  people around him. And he's listening to the bad ones on this. This is why you don't load your whole [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3980.98s)]
*  cabinet up with nothing but pro Israel people that you know, it should also be pointed out. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3987.46s)]
*  And this is part of why it's such a betrayal to his own base that he's not going to get [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=3994.18s)]
*  mass deportations done either. You know, which by the way, the timing of him totally bitching out [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4001.06s)]
*  on that works really well with the timing of this happening. Because right now you have a situation [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4008.18s)]
*  where Donald Trump has majority, the majority of the American people support mass deportations. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4014.1s)]
*  Donald Trump was elected on the issue of immigration twice, three times if you ask his supporters. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4021.14s)]
*  The majority supports Donald Trump's position, but it's a difficult policy to enact. And the [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4029.38s)]
*  minority who opposes it is mobilized and energetic. They are now back out on the streets, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4035.54s)]
*  protesting Donald Trump. In other words, Donald Trump needed all of his political capital [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4041.46s)]
*  in order to get his signature issue through. And instead, he's going to completely divide his base. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4048.66s)]
*  It's going to divide his base over this. So just so you know, we're never getting any of that done. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4056.42s)]
*  The neocon agenda of attacking the world and inviting the world, the neocon agenda of removing [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4060.8999999999996s)]
*  all having regime change against all of Israel's enemies are alive and well. They are as always, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4067.06s)]
*  they're winning the day politically, even though they're losing the day with the people. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4073.94s)]
*  Think about it like this. How crazy is this? The term neocon is now a pejorative to the point [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4081.62s)]
*  that people like Mark Levin and Douglas Murray go, no fair, don't you call me that name. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4089.62s)]
*  You got to stop using that name. That's a secret code word for you hate Jews. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4097.62s)]
*  Think about it from the people, from the guy who wrote the book, The Case for Neoconservatism, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4102.26s)]
*  or the neoconservatism, why we need it or whatever his dumb book was called. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4107.46s)]
*  That guy, Mark Levin, the self-described neoconservatives now say, don't call me that. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4112.02s)]
*  That's a mean word. That's how much neoconservatives have lost the argument with the [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4117.14s)]
*  American people. They now say you're a racist if you use the term neocon. That's how much they've [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4122.66s)]
*  lost the argument. Yet still, their policy wins the day. How crazy is that? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4128.82s)]
*  Listen, I knew this was going to happen. I knew I was going to end up in this situation at some [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4137.86s)]
*  point. I was hoping I wouldn't, but it seemed inevitable. I had a lot of people in the MAGA [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4142.58s)]
*  world who were just loving me when I came out and supported Donald Trump. A lot of those same people [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4148.099999999999s)]
*  are now hating me that I'm criticizing him and apologizing for supporting him. That's fine. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4155.94s)]
*  I always knew when those people were celebrating me that it was kind of phony and I kind of feel [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4162.9s)]
*  the same way now. I don't really care. I'm going to keep telling the truth as I see it. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4167.46s)]
*  I will say this, and this is the final thing I'll say, and we can wrap up the episode on this. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4173.0599999999995s)]
*  One of the criticisms of Donald Trump supporters for years and years now has been that they are [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4178.0199999999995s)]
*  members of a cult. Whatever Donald Trump says they're going to support, he could do a 180 on [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4184.42s)]
*  his policy from yesterday and then they'll do a 180 right there with him. I think that is a fair [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4189.54s)]
*  assessment of some of Donald Trump's supporters, but certainly not all of them. I have been [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4196.5s)]
*  really blown away. Part of this is the dynamic I was talking about, how the neocons have completely [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4202.5s)]
*  lost the argument and yet they completely win the policy. It doesn't matter how many debates I do [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4207.22s)]
*  where I just smash a neocon, they still have more influence in DC than me or people who think like [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4212.42s)]
*  me ever will, at least anytime soon. But it has been remarkable to see how many of the influential [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4217.78s)]
*  right-wing people, Trump supporters, are just not supporting this policy, are coming out against it. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4226.66s)]
*  And I would just, for whatever influence I have, I would just say, hey look, you know all those [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4233.3s)]
*  Joe Biden supporters who really were members of a cult, who literally just repeated whatever the [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4239.22s)]
*  corporate media said, oh Ivermectin is horse dewormer, horse dewormer, horse dewormer, he's sharp [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34xnRJ8ZALg&t=4244.66s)]
