# Dave Smith | Jillian Michaels | Part Of The Problem 1236
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI)
*  Hey, what's up everybody? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=7.88s)]
*  I'm very excited for this one. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=10.72s)]
*  Thrilled to be joined by Jillian Michaels, who is, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  there's a lot of titles you have, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  so I'm not quite sure what I should give for an introduction. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=18.52s)]
*  She's a fitness guru, known for her television shows [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=21.12s)]
*  and her many books, several New York Times bestsellers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=26.12s)]
*  Has kind of been in the health world for a long time [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=30.04s)]
*  and has recently become, I think, pretty outspoken [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=33.88s)]
*  with support of Bobby Kennedy and criticisms of COVID insanity. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=37.44s)]
*  I think a very interesting part [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=43.76s)]
*  of this kind of massive political realignment, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=45.92s)]
*  this crazy moment that we're all living through. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=48.36s)]
*  And so I really was very excited to talk to you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=52.2s)]
*  So thank you so much, Jillian, for taking some time out for us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  I literally tried to find Adderall to keep up with you today. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=59.16s)]
*  I don't take it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  I was like, does anybody I know take it? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=63.72s)]
*  How am I going to be on Dave's show? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=65.96s)]
*  I mean, I have been watching you for years now [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=68.64s)]
*  and learning from you, and I'm really excited to be on. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to do my best today. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=73.6s)]
*  Oh, well, thank you so much. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=75.32s)]
*  That's very kind of you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=76.56s)]
*  And well, I appreciate that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  And as you know, I've told you this personally before, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=80.16s)]
*  but my wife is like a huge, huge fan of you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  She was so excited. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=84.92s)]
*  When we were on Pierce Morgan together, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=86.36s)]
*  and then I ended up getting triggered by Joe Walsh, I think, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=88.72s)]
*  and just yelling at him the whole time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  But you like said something nice about me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=94.44s)]
*  And she's like, do you have any idea what this means? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=96.28s)]
*  Jillian Michaels likes your show. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, no, I know. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=100.72s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  But anyway, thank you very much. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=102.96s)]
*  That's very kind of you to say. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=104.24s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=106.28s)]
*  I think it goes without saying, but I'm [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=107.0s)]
*  glad that me liking your show matters. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  I now see Joe Rogan deferring to your positions. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=111.08s)]
*  But I'm glad that she could get excited about me being a fan. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=115.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=119.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=121.0s)]
*  For my brother, Joe Rogan doing it is really cool. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=122.48s)]
*  For my wife, she's like, yeah, whatever. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=125.6s)]
*  But tell me more about Jillian Michaels. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=127.36s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=128.92s)]
*  So I wanted to ask you, because I'm very curious about this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=131.6s)]
*  And I thought one of the, I mean, there were many. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=135.32s)]
*  But one of the really fascinating things to me [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=139.16s)]
*  during COVID times, it started pretty early in the lockdowns. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=141.04s)]
*  Was it was just this very bizarre thing where we have, like, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=144.96s)]
*  what is a health emergency. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=149.68s)]
*  And then immediately, the first response is, like, shut down [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=152.44s)]
*  the gyms and keep open the liquor stores. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=157.32s)]
*  And then there were a lot of people in kind of the health world [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=160.52s)]
*  who understandably sort of objected to that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=166.28s)]
*  They were like, yeah, this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=169.56s)]
*  Was this kind of like part of your story too? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=171.0s)]
*  Or what were your, like, politics before the COVID era? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=173.56s)]
*  How did they change through that? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=177.8s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=179.4s)]
*  I was exceptionally liberal pre-COVID. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=180.56s)]
*  And I am guilty of understanding why you might close a gym. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=186.84s)]
*  At the time when the hospitals were overrun, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  and I had caught it from a friend, and I was perfectly fine. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=195.32s)]
*  But it was obviously very transmissible. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=199.24s)]
*  And at that time, we were worrying about our parents, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=203.4s)]
*  and we didn't know who was vulnerable, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  and you were hearing all kinds of craziness. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=207.44s)]
*  So when I first heard all of this stuff, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=209.36s)]
*  like it came from a wet market, and we need to close the gyms, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=211.4s)]
*  and if we can just control this for two weeks, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=214.24s)]
*  we're going to get a hold of it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=217.4s)]
*  Just two weeks, guys. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  Just stay strong. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=219.72s)]
*  And then it's week after week, and all of a sudden, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=221.24s)]
*  the stories don't add up, and the science doesn't make sense. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  And you're seeing all of these incongruencies and policy [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=227.6s)]
*  and one from California that was my absolute favorite [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=232.88s)]
*  is what I call the COVID layer. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=236.16s)]
*  So when you were allowed to go to a restaurant, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=238.84s)]
*  you had to wear your mask. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=242.16s)]
*  And when you would walk from the hostess stand to the table, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  you could catch COVID. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=248.92s)]
*  So you must wear your mask. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  But once you sit down, and you begin eating and talking [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=251.76s)]
*  with other people in a room filled with other people, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=255.68s)]
*  you see you were below the COVID layer. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  And at that point, I was like, this is bananas. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  You started to see absolute madness and inconsistencies [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  and hypocrisy and silencing doctors [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=271.72s)]
*  that were exceptionally credible. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=275.88s)]
*  And I started to feel like Neo in The Matrix, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  like I think many of us did. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, I remember, I used to joke around about this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  So when I first started doing it, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=284.92s)]
*  because at first, the comedy clubs were closed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=286.6s)]
*  But then once I was allowed to get back out [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=289.48s)]
*  and do stand up, they'd have like capacity restrictions [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=291.4s)]
*  sometimes, but they did the same thing at comedy clubs, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  where you had to wear your mask as you walked through it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=297.12s)]
*  But then once you sat down, you could drink and eat and laugh. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=299.52s)]
*  This is what everyone was doing there is there to laugh. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=302.12s)]
*  And this was the most bizarre thing of it to me. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=304.32s)]
*  So I'd be on stage looking at a crowd. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=307.28s)]
*  So my perspective is like, I'm watching everyone. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=310.0s)]
*  And sometimes you would see someone get up [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=312.96s)]
*  to go to the bathroom and not put their mask on. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  Like, forget, they get up and go. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=318.67999999999995s)]
*  And other people would start looking at them like, whoa, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=320.72s)]
*  like, hey, you're up there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=323.6s)]
*  You're up there where there's COVID, you know? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=325.56s)]
*  And it's like, it was something about just like the ability [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=327.32000000000005s)]
*  of people to follow rules that made no sense at all. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=329.88000000000005s)]
*  It was some like real time Milgram experiment thing, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=335.24s)]
*  like just an expert said this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=338.12s)]
*  So we're all going to pretend this makes sense, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=340.0s)]
*  even though it's so obvious. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=341.68s)]
*  Like the guy was just sitting next to you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  And I could see you getting nervous as he stood up. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=344.92s)]
*  It's just totally bizarre. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  I could not agree with you more. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=350.12s)]
*  And unfortunately, there were so many examples just like that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=352.48s)]
*  And it just began to grow my concern exponentially. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=359.48s)]
*  And if you, as you begin to look a little bit deeper, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=365.4s)]
*  it's like, God forbid you pull on one thread. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=368.16s)]
*  When the whole facade starts to fall away, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=371.64s)]
*  it gets pretty frigging nefarious, Dave. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=374.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=376.96s)]
*  Yeah, I know it really does. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=377.48s)]
*  And I'd imagine, you know, there was a, one of the, you know, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=379.56s)]
*  there were so many different little dramas within COVID. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=385.56s)]
*  But one of the things, and I was thinking [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=388.28s)]
*  about this earlier today in anticipation of you coming on. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=390.52s)]
*  But I know there was this one, there's this Dr. Hotez. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=394.32s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=398.76s)]
*  Right, so this is the guy who like refused [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  to debate Bobby Kennedy on Joe Rogan's podcast. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=402.68s)]
*  And Joe brought him up recently the other day. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=405.6s)]
*  And he was just kind of making the, you know, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=408.56s)]
*  the case about how the guy's like overweight [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  and eats junk food and doesn't exercise. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  But his life's work is making sure everybody takes vaccines. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=415.28s)]
*  And it was all about demonizing all of the people [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=418.91999999999996s)]
*  who were skeptical about the COVID vaccine, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=421.44s)]
*  if that's even what you can call it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=424.4s)]
*  No, let's call it a shot. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  I would say at this point. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=428.88s)]
*  I mean, it's not a vaccine in the sense [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  of what everybody always meant by the term vaccine. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=434.12s)]
*  But I guess, you know, updated definitions, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=436.68s)]
*  very conveniently updated definitions. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=438.56s)]
*  But I did think there was something, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=440.52s)]
*  and this isn't like, okay, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=442.2s)]
*  like I'm not saying it's a law of logic [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=444.24s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=446.76s)]
*  Like you could smoke two packs a day [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=447.6s)]
*  and say cigarettes are bad for you. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=450.44s)]
*  And you're right, even though you're, you know, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=451.92s)]
*  kind of being a hypocrite. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=454.44s)]
*  The argument you're making isn't necessarily wrong. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=456.12s)]
*  But there is something kind of fascinating. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=458.52s)]
*  And in a way, this is part of to me [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=461.32s)]
*  what Bobby Kennedy represents. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=463.6s)]
*  There is something fascinating [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=466.0s)]
*  about like really unhealthy people [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=468.04s)]
*  lecturing everybody else about their health. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=471.52s)]
*  And then you look at somebody like Bobby Kennedy, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=474.2s)]
*  who is however, whatever you think of the guy, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=477.0s)]
*  clearly personally very committed to health. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=479.4s)]
*  Like, I don't know, he's like in his sixties [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=481.36s)]
*  and doing like 15 pull-ups and then hitting like the, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=483.44s)]
*  and it's just like, okay, that's to me kind of impressive. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=486.8s)]
*  And something we ought to like, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=489.76s)]
*  that's a good example for people. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=491.0s)]
*  And there's just something where it's almost like, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=493.76000000000005s)]
*  there's this weird dynamic where it seemed to me like the, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=496.48s)]
*  so Candace Owens said this once, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=501.44000000000005s)]
*  it really hit home with me. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=503.40000000000003s)]
*  She said something, she goes, you know, after October 7th, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=506.12s)]
*  a lot of people demanded that we pay attention [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=508.88000000000005s)]
*  to what's going on in Israel. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=511.24s)]
*  And then a lot of us started paying attention to it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  And they, people got upset that we didn't have, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  and it almost seems like there was this demand [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=517.72s)]
*  to have a national conversation about health. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=520.32s)]
*  And then a lot of people were like, okay, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=522.88s)]
*  let's have that conversation about health. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=524.72s)]
*  And now it seems like, oh, you guys don't like [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=526.72s)]
*  where the conversation is going. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=528.72s)]
*  But as somebody who's been in, like, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=530.32s)]
*  this has been your world, this is your life's work. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=532.52s)]
*  It's gotta be kind of an interesting position [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=535.56s)]
*  to listen to like these people [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=537.48s)]
*  who clearly do not take health seriously, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=539.0s)]
*  pretend that they're the champions of it now. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=541.52s)]
*  I don't think that that is the argument [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=544.8s)]
*  they're actually making. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=547.6s)]
*  Vaccines, now listen, this is my personal position. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=550.08s)]
*  So we can get this out of the way from go. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=552.96s)]
*  Two things can be true at once, right? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=557.36s)]
*  Vaccines can save lives, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=559.12s)]
*  and they can also cause tremendous injury. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=560.9200000000001s)]
*  Now it's more rare, but we don't really understand [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=564.4000000000001s)]
*  what causes vaccine injury. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=567.76s)]
*  And asking the right questions, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=569.4000000000001s)]
*  mitigating how many vaccines a human being gets [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=571.5200000000001s)]
*  from birth to 18 years old, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=575.0400000000001s)]
*  these are conversations we need to be having. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=577.88s)]
*  Now the COVID shot vaccine, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=580.12s)]
*  I was just talking to Dr. Heather Hang, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=582.9200000000001s)]
*  Brett Weinstein's wife, and she's like, it's gene therapy. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  This is not a vaccine. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=587.8000000000001s)]
*  So that's out of the mouth of a PhD. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=589.36s)]
*  This is big business. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=591.72s)]
*  I don't think these people are advocating for health. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=593.08s)]
*  It's big business. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=596.52s)]
*  I think that is what their agenda actually is. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=599.8000000000001s)]
*  And when the conversation did start to become [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  about health, you saw the pushback. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  And I don't believe in my entire life. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=610.04s)]
*  I have ever seen an individual [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=613.9599999999999s)]
*  quite so demonized as Bobby Kennedy. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=616.8s)]
*  I mean, he eats dogs. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you remember that one? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=623.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=624.5999999999999s)]
*  That was in, I think that was actually in Newsweek. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=625.8s)]
*  So help me God, or Vanity Fair, he eats dogs. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  He is a predator. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  He is deranged. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=634.24s)]
*  He's got worms in his brain. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=636.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, the attacks were relentless and vicious [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=637.8000000000001s)]
*  as soon as it became about, I don't know, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=643.84s)]
*  childhood obesity, infertility, autism. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=646.4s)]
*  Man, it was a whole different animal at that time. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=651.48s)]
*  Yeah, and it's really, I'll say, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=654.6s)]
*  I've never seen a presidential campaign. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=656.36s)]
*  And I've talked to both Bobby and Nicole Shanahan [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=660.12s)]
*  about this several times, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=663.8000000000001s)]
*  but I've never really seen anything [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=665.16s)]
*  quite like his presidential campaign, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=667.36s)]
*  which obviously like, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=669.76s)]
*  he didn't end up winning the presidency, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=670.76s)]
*  but he ended up kind of leveraging the millions of people [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  who supported him into getting the health department [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=675.28s)]
*  in this very interesting, you know, Maha Maga coalition. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=678.04s)]
*  But where he essentially took an issue [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  that no one in politics was really talking about. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=686.24s)]
*  And he said, I'm gonna make this [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=689.48s)]
*  the centerpiece of my campaign. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=690.64s)]
*  And it has now become one of, if not the most dominant [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=693.28s)]
*  like political issues of our time. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=698.56s)]
*  This is, if it wasn't for Bobby Kennedy, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=701.24s)]
*  nobody else is talking about the health crisis [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  in this country, at least in a political level. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=706.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying there's not like any sociologist. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=708.56s)]
*  Yeah, like there's a nutritionist out there [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  who's talking about it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=713.0s)]
*  But I mean like somebody running for president [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=713.8399999999999s)]
*  who's talking about the fact that like, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=715.72s)]
*  we lead the world in chronic illness. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=717.8s)]
*  Like, how does that not come up all the time? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=720.16s)]
*  It just seems so wild. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=722.12s)]
*  It's the most on healthcare, by the way. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=723.52s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=725.76s)]
*  And it's all because of this. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=726.76s)]
*  I mean, I remember, you know, years ago, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=727.86s)]
*  reading about like back when it was like [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=730.88s)]
*  the Obamacare debate in like 2009, 2010, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=732.48s)]
*  I remember reading about how like the CDC estimates [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=736.1s)]
*  that 70% of our medical costs are from preventable illnesses. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=738.76s)]
*  And you're like, wow, that should probably be [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=743.12s)]
*  at the center of this conversation. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=745.96s)]
*  Cause like, if you have, I think essentially the point [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=747.52s)]
*  is that whether you have a completely free market [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=751.0s)]
*  privatized health insurance [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=752.88s)]
*  or a completely socialized health insurance system, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=754.44s)]
*  if you have obesity rates through the roof, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=758.36s)]
*  if you lead the world in chronic illness, it doesn't matter. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=761.84s)]
*  It doesn't really matter who's floating the bill. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=764.72s)]
*  The problem is the health. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=767.38s)]
*  I mean, like the problem is the health of our country. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=769.16s)]
*  And it's just wild. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=771.02s)]
*  I've just never seen anything like this before [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=771.96s)]
*  where like one guy made this issue into an issue [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=773.72s)]
*  now that has to be addressed. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=777.3s)]
*  I don't know that anyone will be able to run [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=779.08s)]
*  for president in the future [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=781.0s)]
*  without having an opinion on this stuff. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  I really hope that's the case. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  I remember speaking with Callie Mean. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=787.0400000000001s)]
*  So I'm gonna presume you're, okay, I figured. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=789.12s)]
*  So Callie is one of the masterminds [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=791.9200000000001s)]
*  behind this Maha Manga union. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=794.0400000000001s)]
*  And this has to be about a year ago. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=797.0s)]
*  And we were sitting down talking on a podcast [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=799.12s)]
*  and I was pretty feeling that the situation [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=802.1600000000001s)]
*  as it stands for Americans and health was pretty dystopian. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=808.12s)]
*  And I didn't have a ton of autism, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=811.8s)]
*  a ton of optimism about it. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=814.0s)]
*  And I remember after Callie was like, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=816.28s)]
*  listen, I'm working on something. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=817.76s)]
*  It's gonna get better. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=820.4399999999999s)]
*  It's gonna change. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=821.64s)]
*  I was like, it's never getting better [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=822.48s)]
*  and it's never gonna change [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=823.74s)]
*  because special interests are too powerful [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=824.92s)]
*  and they have a grip on our politicians [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=827.4s)]
*  and they're the ones that are pulling the strings [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=829.92s)]
*  and there was no possible way [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=832.04s)]
*  unless you reform campaign fine. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=834.0s)]
*  And here, Dave, here we are. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=835.84s)]
*  So credit to where credit is due [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=838.32s)]
*  because you're absolutely right. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=840.04s)]
*  This is not a new message. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=841.44s)]
*  If you go back to a book that I wrote over 15 years ago [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=842.84s)]
*  called Master Metabolism, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=846.88s)]
*  I mean, I talk about red number 40. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=848.48s)]
*  This is not new news. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=852.64s)]
*  It was a more liberal movement for sure. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=854.08s)]
*  If you looked at Marion Nestle and Maria Rodale [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=855.96s)]
*  and Mark Bittman and Mark Hyman and Michael Pollock, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=859.4s)]
*  we were all reaching liberals. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=862.28s)]
*  Nevertheless, it went nowhere. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=864.72s)]
*  Nothing changed and it only got worse. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=867.9599999999999s)]
*  So how this magic moment occurred, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=871.48s)]
*  I think it's multifactorial. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=874.56s)]
*  I think COVID was a part of it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=876.48s)]
*  I think people were completely disenfranchised [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=878.24s)]
*  with both political parties. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=880.24s)]
*  I think you had a few brilliant people [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=881.68s)]
*  with their hearts in the right place [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=883.36s)]
*  and a little bit of magic has happened. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=884.92s)]
*  Now, how much he will be able to achieve [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=886.8s)]
*  remains to be seen, but I promise you [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=890.82s)]
*  that he is far better than the alternative. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=894.34s)]
*  And if I could point out just a few things, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=896.3000000000001s)]
*  if we were to criticize the fact [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=899.36s)]
*  that he's not an MD or a PhD, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=900.62s)]
*  neither is Xavier Becerra who was head of HHS before him. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=903.0600000000001s)]
*  And if we're going to ask questions [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=908.62s)]
*  about childhood vaccines, and that's deeply alarming to do [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=911.22s)]
*  and demand gold standard research and what have you [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=915.1400000000001s)]
*  and have placebo groups like this is so scary [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=918.62s)]
*  and why would we do such a thing? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=921.02s)]
*  But let's say that's really, you're alarmed. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=923.1s)]
*  Xavier Becerra and his administration, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=926.6s)]
*  the Biden administration moved to remove, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=929.54s)]
*  I promise you Google it, it's true, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=933.88s)]
*  any age restriction on gender affirming care, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=936.02s)]
*  which is a really fancy way of saying sterilization, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=941.08s)]
*  taking away a child's ability to have an orgasm, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=944.5s)]
*  interrupting their brain while it's developing impurity. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=946.9s)]
*  I mean, the atrocities quite honestly associated [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=949.86s)]
*  with medicalizing the transition of children, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=952.4599999999999s)]
*  to do that at any age and remove any and all restrictions, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=955.62s)]
*  where was the outrage about any of the crap [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=958.8199999999999s)]
*  that they did or didn't do? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  Not a peep, but then you have a guy [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=965.34s)]
*  that wants to facilitate real change [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=967.76s)]
*  and has been given that mandate [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=970.5799999999999s)]
*  and everyone's up in arms fighting [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=972.34s)]
*  for the pharmaceutical companies [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=974.14s)]
*  and gene therapy is vaccines, it's surprising. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=977.5s)]
*  All right guys, let's take a moment [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=981.28s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1050.28s)]
*  Well, it's also, I will say, and like I, you know, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1052.22s)]
*  so my wife is like, she's a bit of a health nother. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1057.22s)]
*  I say that in the, you know, not as an instance. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1063.4199999999998s)]
*  It's like a positive. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1065.9399999999998s)]
*  No, it's like, I mean, look, and she's gotten on me [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1067.54s)]
*  to be healthier over the years and I should, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1070.6599999999999s)]
*  I do better because of her. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1072.82s)]
*  She doesn't leave me too much choice. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1074.8999999999999s)]
*  But I will say that one of the things [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1076.46s)]
*  that was really interesting to me is that it is unbelievable [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1078.82s)]
*  how much this message resonates with mothers [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1084.54s)]
*  because I think mothers are like, particularly today, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1088.02s)]
*  like 2025 moms in this generation are dealing [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1091.06s)]
*  with something that I just don't think previous generations [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1096.3s)]
*  ever had to deal with. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1101.46s)]
*  I mean, I think that my parents' generation, okay, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1102.54s)]
*  there was a lot of poison in the supermarket, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1106.86s)]
*  but none of them really knew. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1109.9199999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1111.4199999999998s)]
*  Like they all just kind of, like, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1112.26s)]
*  they didn't have the information. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1113.08s)]
*  They were just like, what's bread made out of? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1114.08s)]
*  It's bread, you know? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1115.48s)]
*  Like they thought it was still bread, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1116.5s)]
*  just like it was bread for their grandma. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1117.6799999999998s)]
*  It's still bread for them. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1119.06s)]
*  And like, I don't really think they understood that it's [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1119.98s)]
*  like, no, the bread your grandmother made was bread. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1121.82s)]
*  Wonder bread is poison. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1124.74s)]
*  You're giving your kids poison, you know? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1126.82s)]
*  And there is something, they all talk about, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1129.22s)]
*  every time I'm like, I see that we're like the moms [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1131.56s)]
*  of the kids are together. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1133.8600000000001s)]
*  They're always talking about the fact that like, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1135.14s)]
*  when you go to the supermarket, you are like surrounded [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1137.6200000000001s)]
*  by big red and blue poison everywhere. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1141.26s)]
*  And you have to navigate out, like, what am I? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1144.54s)]
*  And I gotta say, this is something that I, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1146.9s)]
*  I don't really have like a firm political view on this. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1148.94s)]
*  I'm kind of thinking it through myself, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1152.5s)]
*  but there really is something about like, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1154.26s)]
*  on the rare occasion that I end up at the supermarket [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1156.94s)]
*  with my wife, where you like sit there and, you know, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1159.3600000000001s)]
*  like the fact that they like, they rent out the aisles [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1162.9s)]
*  that are at kid level aisles with like the cereal [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1166.38s)]
*  that's got like a big cartoon character on it, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1170.52s)]
*  that is like pure garbage, that we know, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1173.5800000000002s)]
*  like we know for a scientific fact, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1175.78s)]
*  this is like the worst thing to do to your kids. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1177.46s)]
*  And like, if somebody were trying to sell drugs to kids [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1180.06s)]
*  in this way, we would like, I would throw this person [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1183.46s)]
*  in jail for 300 years if they ever tried [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1186.3s)]
*  to do something like that, you know? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1188.7s)]
*  And yet these giant corporations who have bought off [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1189.98s)]
*  our government have completely captured [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1192.76s)]
*  all the regulatory industries. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1194.58s)]
*  They are sitting here selling what we now scientifically [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1196.3s)]
*  know is a drug for kids. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1199.22s)]
*  It is literally poison that's going to get them hooked [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1201.9s)]
*  on it and make their body desire more and more of it. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1205.22s)]
*  And it does just seem to me that it's like, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1207.86s)]
*  this is just, it's an unspeakable outrage. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1209.88s)]
*  Like how have we allowed this to happen? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1213.78s)]
*  I think that what happened is you're absolutely right. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1216.82s)]
*  It began with our parents who bought into, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1219.74s)]
*  it's affordable, it's convenient. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1223.02s)]
*  I remember my little microwave breakfast in plastic [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1225.54s)]
*  that had two little pancakes, two little sausages. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1229.3s)]
*  And like, you know, God knows the chemicals [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1233.54s)]
*  and I would fricking bake that in plastics. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1235.8999999999999s)]
*  And my mom was like, we are winning. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1240.74s)]
*  That is two minutes, it's ready to go, it's healthy. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1243.46s)]
*  It's a real breakfast and we're out the door. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1247.94s)]
*  She didn't know any better. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1250.8999999999999s)]
*  And even still my evolution in health and wellness [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1252.42s)]
*  was about losing weight and looking skinny. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1256.5s)]
*  And then it became diet foods and lean cuisine was healthy. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1259.48s)]
*  There really wasn't information up until I quite honestly [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1264.16s)]
*  want to say the early 2000s, when you saw the rise [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1268.56s)]
*  of the crunchy liberals I mentioned previously. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1272.2s)]
*  But when you look deeper at how this happened, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1274.96s)]
*  and I'm going to steal a page from Callie Meane's book. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1278.46s)]
*  It's in the eighties when the big tobacco companies [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1281.24s)]
*  bought the big food companies and they ran their playbook. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1285.32s)]
*  But if we want to go back farther, Dave, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1288.72s)]
*  it starts with big ag being captured and corrupted [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1290.88s)]
*  through the first incarnation of the farm bill. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1295.64s)]
*  And basically, long story short, how this evolved [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1299.04s)]
*  is that we have spent over the last 20 years [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1302.08s)]
*  a half of a trillion dollars in our tax dollars [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1306.4s)]
*  going towards genetically engineered seeds [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1310.24s)]
*  that are covered in chemicals that were derived [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1314.08s)]
*  from chemical warfare like Agent Orange. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1318.12s)]
*  So now when you've got Frankencorn and Frankenweed [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1322.32s)]
*  and this, that, the other, and you have subsidized it [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1326.7199999999998s)]
*  and it's exceptionally cheap and exceptionally poisonous [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1329.78s)]
*  and nutrient empty, big food grabs it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1332.4799999999998s)]
*  They take their team of multidisciplinary scientists [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1337.54s)]
*  that study your kid's behavior and yours [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1340.8s)]
*  that have learned how to target the bliss point [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1343.52s)]
*  in your brain so you can't eat just one. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1345.36s)]
*  And they then absolutely brag about it, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1348.42s)]
*  which is even more. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1350.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1352.54s)]
*  That was their slogan. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1353.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1354.22s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1355.06s)]
*  You will be. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1355.8999999999999s)]
*  All the way to the healthy because you cannot eat [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1357.74s)]
*  just one. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1360.02s)]
*  We got you. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1360.86s)]
*  And then big pharma is the third piece of this toxic triad [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1362.7s)]
*  and they swoop in and they medicalize everything [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1366.7s)]
*  and they pay off all of the studies. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1369.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, let's be honest. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1372.26s)]
*  So we're just starting to wake up to that. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1374.18s)]
*  I think in a big way and moms is, in my opinion, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1377.18s)]
*  are always where the grassroots movements start [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1381.18s)]
*  and take it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1384.18s)]
*  Thank goodness. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1385.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1386.7s)]
*  Well, I just think it's like, there's something about, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1387.54s)]
*  I mean, I'm not saying it's not true for fathers too, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1391.5s)]
*  but there is something about the connection [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1394.1000000000001s)]
*  between mothers and their kids [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1396.18s)]
*  and how they really just kind of like, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1398.3s)]
*  they're so, they're so, they're so, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1400.3400000000001s)]
*  they really just kind of like, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1402.1399999999999s)]
*  they're so invested in their kids' safety [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1403.78s)]
*  and protection and health. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1406.5s)]
*  And so, yes, I think that it does make sense. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1407.98s)]
*  It's also like, there's, I think like, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1411.34s)]
*  you know, when I, because I talk about this a lot of times, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1414.6599999999999s)]
*  like I'll talk with my mother or with my in-laws [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1416.98s)]
*  and it's like, sometimes I think we lose appreciation for, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1421.2199999999998s)]
*  like my mother-in-law was telling me about [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1424.86s)]
*  how strict her parents were about her cleaning the plate. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1427.4599999999998s)]
*  I mean, you could not leave the table [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1432.7s)]
*  without finishing your food. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1434.78s)]
*  And when you zoom out and you think about it, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1436.06s)]
*  you're like, oh, they were only, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1437.74s)]
*  I mean, they were first generation America. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1438.94s)]
*  They were only one generation away from people [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1440.6200000000001s)]
*  who were legit at food insecurity. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1442.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1445.3s)]
*  And so of course, it's like, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1446.14s)]
*  this all kind of crept up on us pretty quickly, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1447.3s)]
*  where we went just in a few generations from being like, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1450.3s)]
*  my God, if you have a piece of food in front of you [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1452.74s)]
*  and you don't eat that thing, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1454.82s)]
*  what an insult that is to all these people [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1456.26s)]
*  who don't have food. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1458.78s)]
*  And you know what I mean? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1459.8600000000001s)]
*  Your parent remembers being hungry as a kid themselves. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1461.42s)]
*  So of course it was just like, eat, eat, eat. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1464.02s)]
*  And then all of a sudden in a very short period of time [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1466.5s)]
*  to transition to not just tremendous abundance of food, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1469.54s)]
*  but tremendous abundance of very unhealthy food, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1472.74s)]
*  where it's like, hey, no, we actually need to pump the brakes [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1475.9s)]
*  and think about what you're eating. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1478.78s)]
*  And all of these things were all so brand new [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1480.22s)]
*  that I think, obviously it was gonna take people [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1483.46s)]
*  a little bit of time to catch up. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1486.7s)]
*  I think it's wonderful they are catching up. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1487.9s)]
*  One of the things I always find fascinating, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1490.6599999999999s)]
*  even as you kind of discuss this [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1492.06s)]
*  and how you were very liberal for many years, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1493.62s)]
*  is that it is interesting to me [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1496.54s)]
*  that this just so inherently seems to be, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1498.34s)]
*  I mean, I guess it's a human issue [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1503.86s)]
*  that we should all care about, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1505.1399999999999s)]
*  but there's no way you could ever convince me [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1506.34s)]
*  that this isn't something left-wingers [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1507.9799999999998s)]
*  or liberals should care about. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1509.9399999999998s)]
*  This is more of a left-wing liberal issue [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1511.34s)]
*  than it is a right-wing issue. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1513.3s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about big corporations [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1514.62s)]
*  stacking the deck against ordinary people. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1518.18s)]
*  And by the way, there's also a huge class issue [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1521.0600000000002s)]
*  that comes into this equation, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1524.46s)]
*  where it's really, people who are doing pretty well, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1526.18s)]
*  it's not that big of a deal for me [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1529.5800000000002s)]
*  if I gotta spend more money [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1531.7s)]
*  for my kids to have the healthy food, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1533.6200000000001s)]
*  but for people living on a very fixed income [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1535.5800000000002s)]
*  or a very, very tight, living paycheck to paycheck, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1537.98s)]
*  that's a huge issue for them, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1541.18s)]
*  that they would have to triple their grocery bill [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1543.14s)]
*  in order to get grass-fed meat [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1546.66s)]
*  and whole foods and all of this stuff. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1549.0600000000002s)]
*  And it seems like that's just, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1551.3400000000001s)]
*  it's like an issue that's right there [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1553.66s)]
*  for the left to care about. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1554.98s)]
*  This is your issue, guys. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1557.22s)]
*  This is a completely unfair system [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1558.8600000000001s)]
*  rigged against the working class and the poor. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1560.74s)]
*  But you know why they're not saying anything about it [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1563.78s)]
*  is because they've also been captured by special interests. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1567.6200000000001s)]
*  And it's funny that you bring up marginalized communities, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1572.02s)]
*  these soda companies target children of color two to one. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1576.22s)]
*  Where's all your systemic racist talk now? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1581.82s)]
*  Where's the outrage now? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1586.74s)]
*  Not a peep. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1588.98s)]
*  They literally go after their heroes, their celebrities, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1590.06s)]
*  to capture their kids like pied pipers [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1596.3s)]
*  of fast food addiction and nobody's mad. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1600.1799999999998s)]
*  They go after the poor with programs like SNAP [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1603.74s)]
*  or I think it's called Women and Children, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1607.98s)]
*  programs that we have, food programs for people [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1610.78s)]
*  who are less wealthy, not as well off, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1613.82s)]
*  however you want to marginalize, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1619.06s)]
*  however you want to describe it [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1620.22s)]
*  in the most politically correct way possible. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1621.46s)]
*  Nevertheless, they are absolutely targeted. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1624.06s)]
*  They are the ones that are being preyed upon. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1628.02s)]
*  They are the ones that are being marketed to [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1630.6200000000001s)]
*  and they're the ones that are having this crap [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1632.6599999999999s)]
*  forced down their throat. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1634.8999999999999s)]
*  But should you question whether or not sodas [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1635.8999999999999s)]
*  should be removed from programs like SNAP, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1641.1s)]
*  Food Stamps Program, that's racist. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1643.6599999999999s)]
*  Because now you're denying, I swear to God, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1646.62s)]
*  and again, I want to give credit where credit is due, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1649.22s)]
*  this is Callie Means, pointed this out [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1651.1399999999999s)]
*  a couple of years ago now, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1653.58s)]
*  because like the Hispanic Freedom League [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1655.46s)]
*  or the NAACP is taking such massive donations [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1658.86s)]
*  from the fast food companies [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1663.02s)]
*  and the soda companies in particular, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1664.06s)]
*  they run right out there and they're like, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1665.74s)]
*  this is racist for you to take away these valuable calories [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1667.06s)]
*  from children of color who are in poverty. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1671.5s)]
*  It is diabolical when those kids are being targeted [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1675.94s)]
*  by those bastards, two to one. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1680.58s)]
*  Yeah, so I'll say a couple things on this [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1683.98s)]
*  that just literally just come to my mind. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1686.74s)]
*  I remember I went to, briefly, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1688.38s)]
*  I went to college in Oneonta, New York, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1691.94s)]
*  which is like way upstate, halfway to Canada, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1695.22s)]
*  upstate New York, and oh man, I hated it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1697.3400000000001s)]
*  It was boring and cold. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1700.46s)]
*  There's nothing to do except drink up there. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1702.18s)]
*  That was the only part I liked. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1703.9s)]
*  Exactly, that wasn't bad. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1705.14s)]
*  That part was cool, but the rest of it sucked. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1707.2600000000002s)]
*  But I remember, it was like this, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1709.46s)]
*  I'd always lived in New York City my entire life. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1710.8600000000001s)]
*  And so it was like the first time [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1713.7s)]
*  I was ever like living in like a small town. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1714.98s)]
*  And I remember just being blown away [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1717.18s)]
*  by how fat all the locals were. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1719.22s)]
*  And then the fact that there was like, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1722.3400000000001s)]
*  there was nothing in this town, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1724.7s)]
*  but there was every fast food place. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1727.26s)]
*  I mean, there was a KFC, a Burger King, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1729.66s)]
*  a Wendy's, a McDonald's, like every single fast food. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1731.5400000000002s)]
*  There was an Arby's, there was that, that's all they had. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1735.0600000000002s)]
*  It was like bars and fast food was all they had. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1736.98s)]
*  And every day you would just see like these [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1739.74s)]
*  incredibly overweight families eating this fast food. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1743.0200000000002s)]
*  And even at the time, this was like 2003 [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1746.1399999999999s)]
*  or something like that, I was like, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1748.1799999999998s)]
*  man, this is just seems bad. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1749.8999999999999s)]
*  And not knowing that much about it, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1752.5s)]
*  but I was like, this sure ain't good. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1754.98s)]
*  And then I remember, so when I lived in New York City, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1756.58s)]
*  this was like about probably around like 10 years ago, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1760.9399999999998s)]
*  is before I had kids, but my very good friend, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1765.02s)]
*  Louis J. Gomez, also very talented comedian. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1768.8999999999999s)]
*  So I lived in the Upper West Side, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1772.58s)]
*  and he lived in Harlem. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1775.02s)]
*  And so it was like a 15, 20 minute walk. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1777.18s)]
*  And I used to do the walk all the time. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1781.42s)]
*  I'd always go over and visit him and his kid [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1782.82s)]
*  up at their house. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1784.58s)]
*  And if people know New York City, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1786.1s)]
*  like the Upper West Side is a very white neighborhood, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1789.34s)]
*  Harlem is historically a black neighborhood, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1791.46s)]
*  which is changing a bit now. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1794.94s)]
*  But I remember like, as you'd make the walk, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1797.14s)]
*  you could just see the food stores changing. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1800.78s)]
*  It goes from like on the Upper West Side, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1804.74s)]
*  everything was kind of health oriented. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1807.18s)]
*  And then as soon as you started getting [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1809.94s)]
*  into the convenience stores in Harlem, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1811.38s)]
*  it's all gushers and can't. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1813.02s)]
*  And so while people kind of go like, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1815.06s)]
*  okay, restricting SNAP programs are racist. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1817.06s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but what about this? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1819.58s)]
*  Like, isn't this kind of messed up? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1822.22s)]
*  And I'm not saying like, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1824.1s)]
*  look, part of that is a cultural issue. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1825.14s)]
*  Part of it's an education issue. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1828.14s)]
*  There is truth to the fact that like- [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1830.58s)]
*  You're 100% right though, Dave. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1832.46s)]
*  You are 100% right. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1833.42s)]
*  Your instinct is absolutely accurate. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1835.7s)]
*  And I would imagine in upstate New York [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1838.3000000000002s)]
*  in this area that was rural and more poor, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1840.14s)]
*  I guess they're white, right? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1844.5s)]
*  I mean, now they do target, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1846.1000000000001s)]
*  as I mentioned, people of color two to one. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1848.26s)]
*  However, they go after poor people across the board. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1850.22s)]
*  And that's why you have these food deserts. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1855.98s)]
*  All of this is by design. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1859.46s)]
*  And it's a much longer conversation [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1862.94s)]
*  about how they managed to do it, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1865.74s)]
*  but it has been going on for just about a hundred years. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1867.46s)]
*  And it started with how they gamed the agriculture [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1870.42s)]
*  so that all of the money went to Monsanto's places, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1875.14s)]
*  you know, the big farming industrial complex, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1881.18s)]
*  that whole thing. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1884.46s)]
*  And after World War II, mechanization. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1886.22s)]
*  And then it's like, oh no, we've got a rural food issue. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1889.74s)]
*  Okay, let's give more to these genetically engineered crops. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1892.6599999999999s)]
*  There's a whole history to it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1896.02s)]
*  It's exceptionally diabolical. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1898.4199999999998s)]
*  It's dense, but it is absolutely by design [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1901.58s)]
*  and your instinct is 100% right. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1905.6999999999998s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1908.62s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1960.02s)]
*  Yeah, and it's just wild to me that doesn't seem, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1962.18s)]
*  it's almost like out of, and as the point I made, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1966.9s)]
*  like it was poor people in Oneonta who were white people, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1970.7s)]
*  and then it was the poorer people in Harlem [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1973.58s)]
*  who happened to be black people. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1975.98s)]
*  But it's like, there does seem to be a weird thing to me [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1977.38s)]
*  where I'd watch like in this dynamic, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1981.22s)]
*  like Upper West Side versus Harlem, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1983.06s)]
*  and it's almost like the kind of liberal, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1984.74s)]
*  the weird racialism that kind of took over [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1989.54s)]
*  over the last 10 years, where there was, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1992.54s)]
*  it's almost like a white guilt type thing [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1994.22s)]
*  that you don't feel, like you guys don't live this way, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=1996.38s)]
*  but you don't wanna tell them, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2000.0s)]
*  hey, there's a better way to live, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2001.3s)]
*  or like try to move to that, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2003.38s)]
*  because then you feel like that would be bigoted of you [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2004.66s)]
*  to like impose something out there, but it's like no. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2007.38s)]
*  It's all bigoted of you actually. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2009.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's like- [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2011.42s)]
*  It's ableist, it's racist, it's actually called being, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2012.26s)]
*  they have labeled people who have done that, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2019.3000000000002s)]
*  ableist and racist. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2021.3400000000001s)]
*  And in fact, gosh, I can't remember her name, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2022.98s)]
*  but there was a doctor who said calling junk food, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2026.42s)]
*  junk food was racist, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2030.1000000000001s)]
*  because marginalized people of color needed junk food. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2032.9s)]
*  And I remember thinking, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2036.42s)]
*  we have absolutely left Kansas, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2038.8200000000002s)]
*  like this is, the world has inverted itself. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2041.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're, and it was during COVID, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2045.26s)]
*  but one more thing is the healthy at any size movement, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2047.7800000000002s)]
*  derailed the shame narrative, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2053.14s)]
*  all of this comes from big food. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2055.46s)]
*  It's not even a question. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2057.78s)]
*  I encourage people to Google it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2058.94s)]
*  There was an expose, believe it or not, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2060.34s)]
*  in the Washington Post that exposed it. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2063.22s)]
*  So they're paying registered dieticians and influencers [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2065.06s)]
*  in health online to be promoting those hashtags, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2068.7s)]
*  like derailed the shame, healthy at any size. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2071.8199999999997s)]
*  That's all a PsyOP. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2074.22s)]
*  And then they tapped into this, you're right, white guilt. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2076.54s)]
*  So that even doctors were afraid to say [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2081.38s)]
*  to their patients of color, you need to lose some weight. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2083.38s)]
*  It's, Dr. Casey Means talks about it. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2086.14s)]
*  It's, you're spot on. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2089.62s)]
*  A heart that's exactly what's happening. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2091.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, I've felt for a while, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2093.8999999999996s)]
*  like, you know, I think there's, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2095.3399999999997s)]
*  like there's inherently, I think, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2098.06s)]
*  benefits to like, kind of a left-wing worldview [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2100.8199999999997s)]
*  and there's benefits to a right-wing worldview. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2105.7799999999997s)]
*  And I mean, kind of like abstract. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2107.7s)]
*  And then there's weaknesses. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2109.14s)]
*  And I think that, like, I always felt that like, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2110.9799999999996s)]
*  after 9-11 in the George W. Bush terror war days, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2113.62s)]
*  they kind of like, it's almost like [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2117.9799999999996s)]
*  they short-circuited right-wingers. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2119.66s)]
*  Like they tapped into what their weakness was. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2122.5s)]
*  And their weakness was just having this kind of, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2124.06s)]
*  this base of like patriotism and good versus evil. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2127.14s)]
*  And once you tapped into that, it was like, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2131.3399999999997s)]
*  we gotta go see about Saddam Hussein. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2134.14s)]
*  He did 9-11 or something like that. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2136.02s)]
*  And like, if you tried back then, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2137.74s)]
*  if you tried to talk to a right-winger, like logically, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2139.7s)]
*  and you were like, no, no, no, listen, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2142.42s)]
*  Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist party [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2143.7s)]
*  hates the radical Sunni terrorists. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2145.9s)]
*  There was no way they were working together. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2148.42s)]
*  Like these guys are mortal enemies. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2150.38s)]
*  It was just like, oh, so you're saying [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2152.02s)]
*  you're on Durkha Durkha's side and you're not on USA side. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2153.62s)]
*  And it was just shut down the conversation. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2156.46s)]
*  And then likewise, over the last decade, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2159.06s)]
*  I feel like there's something which probably, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2161.38s)]
*  much like with the right-wingers, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2163.9s)]
*  it probably originates from like a good place. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2165.02s)]
*  I'm not talking about the people rigging the system. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2167.34s)]
*  I'm talking about regular people. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2168.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2170.46s)]
*  You know, like where there's this desire from liberals [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2171.7000000000003s)]
*  to be like, we're not the bigoted ones. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2175.58s)]
*  You know, we're not the racists. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2178.02s)]
*  We're not the people who are mean. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2179.98s)]
*  We're the people, we're not the religious [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2181.7000000000003s)]
*  superstitious people. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2183.26s)]
*  We follow the science. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2184.2200000000003s)]
*  But then the problem is like when they tap into that [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2185.6600000000003s)]
*  and they go, okay, well, if you say that this fat person [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2189.58s)]
*  is fat, you're a bigot. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2192.1s)]
*  And if you say what the CDC says, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2193.58s)]
*  you're following the science. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2195.58s)]
*  It's like they shortwired people. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2196.94s)]
*  They got them to turn their brains off [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2198.7400000000002s)]
*  and start going like, look, I'm not, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2200.62s)]
*  nobody here is saying like, be a dick to fat people. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2202.46s)]
*  I'm not saying like make fun or make, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2206.46s)]
*  don't be a bad person. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2208.7s)]
*  Don't be shitty to anyone, but come on, let's get real. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2210.14s)]
*  Like, no, big is not beautiful. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2213.8999999999996s)]
*  Big is unhealthy. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2215.98s)]
*  And the correct move is not, you know, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2217.46s)]
*  if you have somebody who you love who's a heroin addict, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2219.8999999999996s)]
*  you don't say like heroin is beautiful. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2222.74s)]
*  And, but you know what I mean? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2225.1s)]
*  Like you try to help them get help and get better [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2226.02s)]
*  because that's how you live. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2228.54s)]
*  And it's just, it's been wild to see [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2229.98s)]
*  that this actually took off. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2232.1s)]
*  Not only did it take off, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2234.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it was wildly popular. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2237.38s)]
*  So in my opinion, there are two reasons why. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2239.6600000000003s)]
*  The first one is cancel culture. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2242.58s)]
*  And I experienced this personally in 2019 [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2244.58s)]
*  from the infamous incident where I was asked [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2247.6600000000003s)]
*  by a crappy little interviewer. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2250.78s)]
*  I don't even know what I was doing on this interview [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2253.1800000000003s)]
*  on Buzzfeed. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2255.42s)]
*  I don't even know what I was doing on Buzzfeed. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2256.42s)]
*  And she asked me if I celebrated Lizzo's, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2258.9s)]
*  Lizzo and Ashley Graham. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2264.78s)]
*  And I didn't know who Ashley Graham was at the time, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2266.62s)]
*  but I knew Lizzo because my kid liked her music. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2268.6600000000003s)]
*  And I was like, she's a great artist. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2270.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2272.58s)]
*  And she's like, well, you know, of course [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2273.62s)]
*  the big question was like, do you celebrate the fact [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2275.2200000000003s)]
*  that she's obese? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2277.82s)]
*  I was like, well, of course I don't celebrate the fact [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2280.1800000000003s)]
*  that she's obese because if you really like her, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2281.78s)]
*  you want her to be around for a long time, right? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2284.1s)]
*  Wouldn't it be terrible if she got diabetes? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2286.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2289.1800000000003s)]
*  It was a catastrophe. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2291.02s)]
*  AT&T had to deal with my app. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2294.34s)]
*  They pulled out. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2296.2599999999998s)]
*  I had like a post scheduled for this dog food company [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2297.38s)]
*  that I like who was like, we're not gonna poster. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2301.54s)]
*  Like we don't want her working with our company. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2304.98s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2306.7s)]
*  So I think when people see someone else being taken [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2309.34s)]
*  to the Gulag, right? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2313.1s)]
*  Stoned in the public square, they're terrified [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2316.02s)]
*  into silence, but the other component of this [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2319.26s)]
*  that we are still seeing in spades is the moral superiority [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2321.78s)]
*  and that high, which comes from virtue signaling. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2327.7400000000002s)]
*  I have the empathetic one. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2332.42s)]
*  It reminds me of Rafe Fiennes with Rafe Fiennes [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2335.1000000000004s)]
*  in Schiller's List where he's like, I pardon you. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2337.94s)]
*  Like it's truly evil actually. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2340.1800000000003s)]
*  And it's purely about your own ego [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2342.98s)]
*  and making yourself feel holier than now. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2346.06s)]
*  But I think it is those two elements of fear and narcissism [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2350.02s)]
*  that have allowed us to become vulnerable [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2356.34s)]
*  to this kind of like brain virus quite literally. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2359.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2363.7s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2366.3s)]
*  And the latter part that you're talking about, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2367.5s)]
*  they're both really important elements to it. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2370.58s)]
*  But the part of that kind of ego boost [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2372.94s)]
*  that you get off of that virtue signaling stuff, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2380.34s)]
*  it is such a poison. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2383.2200000000003s)]
*  It's something all human beings are somewhat vulnerable to. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2385.34s)]
*  And if you wanna be a decent person, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2389.54s)]
*  you have to actually fight that impulse. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2390.78s)]
*  But anytime you're just feeling really good about yourself [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2392.7400000000002s)]
*  when you haven't actually done anything, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2395.78s)]
*  like it's great to feel really good about yourself [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2397.58s)]
*  when you've done something, that's wonderful. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2399.58s)]
*  But when it comes more and then there is, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2401.94s)]
*  and I will say, I've always found that it's a, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2404.34s)]
*  particularly with women, not 100%, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2407.14s)]
*  but particularly with women, there will be this kind of, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2410.86s)]
*  like you just see young girls with bikini bodies [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2414.38s)]
*  talking about how awesome Lizzo is for being overweight. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2419.82s)]
*  And you're like, I think I see what you're doing here. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2422.7000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think there's anything positive about it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2425.2200000000003s)]
*  I think this is a weird tactic. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2427.58s)]
*  You know? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2430.06s)]
*  Yeah, not only is it a weird tactic, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2431.14s)]
*  there were so many fitness people that ended up doing that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2434.06s)]
*  And then, you know, putting like, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2437.86s)]
*  oh, we're gonna put like obese mannequins in fitness clothes [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2439.86s)]
*  and we're gonna, it was absolutely [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2445.54s)]
*  exactly what you're talking about. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2449.46s)]
*  There's one woman in particular who shall remain nameless, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2450.5s)]
*  but had a bit of an eating disorder, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2454.14s)]
*  but was fairly large in fitness, is less well known now, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2456.7s)]
*  but still pretty well known, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2461.02s)]
*  and appealed greatly to more millennials slash Gen Z. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2461.86s)]
*  And you've got this rail thin white girl talking about like, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2467.14s)]
*  let them eat cake. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2471.7s)]
*  Like you piece of shit. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2473.66s)]
*  Yeah, cause it's like- [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2475.7s)]
*  You know she knows, Dave. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2476.94s)]
*  Like you bastard. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2479.62s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2482.1s)]
*  Like you're doing, and there is something, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2482.94s)]
*  some comedic, God, I can't remember. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2484.54s)]
*  I should credit them, but it was such a funny joke. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2486.2599999999998s)]
*  I can't remember whose joke it was, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2488.14s)]
*  but someone had the joke where like, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2490.2999999999997s)]
*  there's like girls keep saying Lizzo looks great. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2491.46s)]
*  And he goes, okay, well, why are you so offended [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2494.8599999999997s)]
*  when I tell you you look like Lizzo? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2496.54s)]
*  And it's just like kind of says it all right there [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2498.62s)]
*  where it's like, look, if you're, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2500.74s)]
*  especially like if you're working hard, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2502.2999999999997s)]
*  cause like particularly when we're talking [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2504.58s)]
*  about younger women, like sometimes people [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2505.54s)]
*  just have good genes and they look great, you know? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2507.5s)]
*  But some people, particularly the people [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2509.74s)]
*  who work really hard at it, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2511.94s)]
*  it's like if you work really hard to look great, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2513.18s)]
*  and then you feel good about yourself [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2515.7s)]
*  cause you look great, which is totally [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2517.2999999999997s)]
*  like noble and that's wonderful. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2519.86s)]
*  But then you're turning around [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2522.1400000000003s)]
*  and like complimenting some other girl [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2523.98s)]
*  instead of encouraging her to follow your path. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2526.26s)]
*  It's like, no, I actually think that's evil. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2528.78s)]
*  I think that's like a really wrong thing to do. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2531.42s)]
*  You're totally right. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2533.9s)]
*  It's absolutely part of the problem. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2535.0200000000004s)]
*  And the even greater irony is all of those virtue signalers [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2537.42s)]
*  like Oprah then turned around and jabbed themselves [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2543.1800000000003s)]
*  with those Zempik at the very first opportunity. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2547.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2549.66s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, the hypocrisy is staggering. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2550.5s)]
*  Absolutely staggering. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2555.06s)]
*  And it's exactly that. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2556.42s)]

*  Yeah, and right, and I'm sure there's a lot of that. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2671.3s)]
*  And then there's also, as you mentioned before, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2674.6200000000003s)]
*  there's just kind of like, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2676.5s)]
*  well, look, there's even for people who won't be sued, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2678.3s)]
*  like you gave the examples where, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2680.46s)]
*  with your app and AT&T and all this, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2682.3s)]
*  where okay, there's gonna be an enormous headache for you. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2684.5s)]
*  And the truth is that human beings by and large [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2687.3s)]
*  do tend to respond to incentives. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2690.42s)]
*  If something's gonna be enormously difficult, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2692.14s)]
*  then fewer people are gonna do it, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2694.2200000000003s)]
*  because of course, who wants to go through difficulties [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2695.9s)]
*  if you don't need to. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2698.9s)]
*  And there's also, there's a social pressure. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2699.86s)]
*  And this is one of the things that's very interesting [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2703.54s)]
*  about the current moment that we're in. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2706.38s)]
*  It's like, you see that once there's not as much [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2708.38s)]
*  of a social price tag to pay for say, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2712.14s)]
*  like supporting Donald Trump, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2714.3s)]
*  all of a sudden he's got the best poll numbers he's ever had [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2715.82s)]
*  because like, okay, when people feel, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2718.2200000000003s)]
*  and I do think that it's something I've come [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2721.1400000000003s)]
*  to appreciate in my life because I am a bit of, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2722.86s)]
*  my personality type and I can tell yours too, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2727.6600000000003s)]
*  is like, you're willing to kind of take the arrows, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2729.94s)]
*  you're willing to be outspoken. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2732.1400000000003s)]
*  And that's kind of a, it's a personality trait, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2733.5800000000004s)]
*  but it is a minority position. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2735.42s)]
*  Most people aren't like that. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2737.5s)]
*  And I think we've evolved to be this way for, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2739.34s)]
*  because we're pack animals [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2741.6600000000003s)]
*  and you don't wanna get too far outside of the pack. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2742.7400000000002s)]
*  That's where predators get you. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2744.7000000000003s)]
*  And like, there's, I remember I was, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2746.2599999999998s)]
*  I was at my sister's house once [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2749.5s)]
*  and there was this guy who's a friend of my sister's [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2752.8999999999996s)]
*  and he's like very, very smart guy. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2757.5s)]
*  He's a college professor. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2759.18s)]
*  And I remember at one point we were in our living room [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2761.02s)]
*  and he kind of leans into me and he goes, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2764.02s)]
*  he goes, you know, I actually agree [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2766.4199999999996s)]
*  with a lot of your politics. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2767.74s)]
*  And I remember being like, why are you whispering? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2769.8999999999996s)]
*  We're in my sister's living room. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2772.62s)]
*  Like, what's gonna happen to you here, man? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2774.82s)]
*  Just say it, put your shoulders back and just say it. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2776.7000000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2779.26s)]
*  But then also I was like, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2780.1000000000004s)]
*  well, maybe I shouldn't be so judgmental. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2781.1000000000004s)]
*  It's like a lot of people, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2782.82s)]
*  like just don't wanna deal with a headache. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2784.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's enormous. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2787.1000000000004s)]
*  There's something that kind of like the dominant, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2788.5800000000004s)]
*  you know, progressive insanity of the last few years, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2792.7400000000002s)]
*  like they really figured that out. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2795.42s)]
*  They figured out that like, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2797.42s)]
*  if you can really have a mass shaming campaign, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2798.42s)]
*  you know, while they're saying, don't shame fat people, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2801.1000000000004s)]
*  don't slut shame, don't shame, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2803.98s)]
*  you know, all the attacks on shaming, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2806.14s)]
*  but they know exactly how powerful shaming is, you know? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2807.7400000000002s)]
*  And so it's like, oh, okay. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2810.58s)]
*  Well, like, you know, again, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2811.7400000000002s)]
*  even with like some of these topics, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2813.26s)]
*  like I'm not saying, I'm not advocating to be mean [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2814.78s)]
*  or to be overly, but they're, you know, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2819.18s)]
*  like with the slut shaming thing, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2822.58s)]
*  I don't mean this for women or men. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2823.9s)]
*  I mean, for both men and women. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2825.34s)]
*  Like, yeah, there should be some degree, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2827.02s)]
*  there should be some degree of shame. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2829.34s)]
*  Like, I don't know, like, yeah, if you're like, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2831.02s)]
*  like, I don't know if someone came to me [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2833.22s)]
*  and was just like man or woman, they were like, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2836.22s)]
*  I just had sex with five people in the bathroom. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2838.98s)]
*  I'd be like, what are you doing? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2840.9s)]
*  You know, like, Jesus Christ, like, get your life together. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2843.02s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2846.94s)]
*  And like, there is- [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2847.78s)]
*  You never blame the victim, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2848.62s)]
*  but there is such a thing as healthy shame. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2849.7s)]
*  It's also, when you commit a crime, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2851.7s)]
*  when you do something unethical, when you hurt somebody, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2854.06s)]
*  there's a healthy shame to that. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2857.2599999999998s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2859.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the wrong thing to do. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2860.1s)]
*  That's a shitty thing to do. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2861.18s)]
*  My mom's a psychoanalyst [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2863.86s)]
*  and we actually have long talks [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2864.7000000000003s)]
*  about what healthy shame looks like [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2865.98s)]
*  and what it's intended to do. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2868.94s)]
*  And it's to help people evolve [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2870.94s)]
*  into becoming a better person. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2874.3s)]
*  Or if somebody is tending towards sociopathy, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2876.5s)]
*  quickly sweeping them back into line. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2880.9s)]
*  But when people are calling out facts [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2884.06s)]
*  that we can conclusively say are facts, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2887.26s)]
*  you know, the earth is not flat, right? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2890.26s)]
*  Being obese is unhealthy. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2893.86s)]
*  I mean, there's a robust amount of data to back this up. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2896.54s)]
*  When you are attacking people for calling out facts [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2900.82s)]
*  and subsequently wanting to question [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2906.58s)]
*  the existing norm and orthodoxy, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2909.02s)]
*  man, there is some evil happening there across the board. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2913.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2919.26s)]
*  It's like removing a necessary component [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2920.18s)]
*  of what keeps a society functioning. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2923.02s)]
*  You know, is that there's like anti-social behavior [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2925.06s)]
*  or destructive behavior, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2927.3399999999997s)]
*  and then there's positive and social behavior. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2928.7799999999997s)]
*  And it's like, you want to encourage one [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2930.94s)]
*  and discourage the other. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2932.5s)]
*  And anyway, it does seem to me, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2934.14s)]
*  and like I will say, you know, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2937.5s)]
*  like I'm with you when you said earlier [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2939.7s)]
*  that like you just couldn't have imagined that like, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2941.74s)]
*  even just like what we're seeing now. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2944.22s)]
*  And again, to your point, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2945.54s)]
*  I'm not saying anything's been done yet. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2947.1s)]
*  Like Bobby getting in there, Tulsa getting in there. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2948.78s)]
*  This is just the beginning. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2950.9s)]
*  And now we start the battle. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2952.1800000000003s)]
*  But it is, but even just to be where we are today [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2955.1400000000003s)]
*  and the way the pendulum has swung and how it's, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2958.5400000000004s)]
*  again, I don't think it's not, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2962.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't think it's as simple as to say that it's like, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2963.98s)]
*  oh, the left lost and the pendulum is swinging back right. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2966.5s)]
*  It's like a whole realignment. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2969.9s)]
*  And I am just very encouraged by it. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2972.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm very encouraged by that. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2974.5800000000004s)]
*  All of that stuff where you're talking about [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2976.34s)]
*  like the fat shaming and the COVID stuff. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2977.94s)]
*  It just seems like in terms of the popular support, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2980.7400000000002s)]
*  it almost feels like it went from an 80-20 issue [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2984.46s)]
*  to an 80-20 issue the other direction. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2986.98s)]
*  Like just nobody's buying into it anymore. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2988.98s)]
*  That I find very encouraging. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2991.42s)]
*  I totally agree with you. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2993.62s)]
*  And it feels like the Wizard of Oz, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2995.34s)]
*  when the wicked witch actually melts, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=2998.7000000000003s)]
*  it's like the sun comes out and everybody. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3000.86s)]
*  Now, I do think it's, you know, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3003.22s)]
*  page one of the book that has yet to be written. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3007.06s)]
*  I think it's gonna be trench warfare [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3010.46s)]
*  and you're seeing it across the board. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3012.2599999999998s)]
*  It's like everybody resists, just resists to resist. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3013.98s)]
*  Oh my God, the sky is falling. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3017.18s)]
*  And you've got all the propaganda [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3019.02s)]
*  whipping up the people on the left. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3023.02s)]
*  And it's like everybody's hit Larian [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3025.66s)]
*  and the world's gonna end and whatever. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3027.78s)]
*  And it's so crazy though, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3029.5s)]
*  because what they're fighting for, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3031.02s)]
*  I don't even think they realize. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3033.94s)]
*  Like when you watched Bobby Kennedy's hearings [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3035.46s)]
*  and he's sitting there saying, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3039.2599999999998s)]
*  we need to ask why are vaccine injuries happening? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3041.54s)]
*  We need to ask like why has autism gone [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3044.86s)]
*  from one in 10,000 to one in 36? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3047.9s)]
*  And everyone is demonizing this guy. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3051.02s)]
*  And they're loving their politicians [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3053.66s)]
*  who take millions from big pharma. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3055.82s)]
*  I just, we've got a long way to go [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3059.34s)]
*  and I am exceptionally optimistic, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3062.9s)]
*  but I wouldn't get complacent. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3065.1s)]
*  That's all I'm saying is it's gonna be an uphill battle. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3067.7400000000002s)]
*  And I do know not to talk out of turn, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3070.54s)]
*  but to get Kennedy confirmed, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3073.94s)]
*  concessions did have to be made. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3076.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't know how public any of that is or not, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3079.98s)]
*  but it obviously goes without question [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3081.94s)]
*  that it's like you will bend a knee to a certain extent. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3084.38s)]
*  We even saw some of that with Tulsi [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3087.42s)]
*  and the whole FISA situation. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3089.02s)]
*  It's like to get there, you will have to make some, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3091.94s)]
*  you'll have to give some stuff up along the way. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3098.2200000000003s)]
*  So it's way better than where we were, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3099.94s)]
*  but I know it's going to be an uphill battle. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3103.54s)]
*  And I think what I'm trying to do is encourage people [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3106.06s)]
*  to stay vigilant and to be patient. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3108.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, well, I think that's perfectly said. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3111.42s)]
*  And it's unfortunate way, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3114.38s)]
*  and I was talking about this during both Bobby [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3115.98s)]
*  and Tulsi's confirmation hearings, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3117.7400000000002s)]
*  where I was just kind of like, listen, guys, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3119.42s)]
*  I know everyone wants them to just dunk on these senators. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3121.14s)]
*  And I know, but everybody wants Bobby [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3124.42s)]
*  when he asked them a question to go like, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3126.46s)]
*  please, you're the most corrupt human being in the world. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3128.18s)]
*  But he needs their votes. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3130.62s)]
*  So this process actually, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3132.94s)]
*  if I was in Bobby's ear right now, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3134.94s)]
*  I'd be just kind of like, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3137.54s)]
*  well, say what you got to say to get in there. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3138.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3140.62s)]
*  That's just, let's get confirmed. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3141.46s)]
*  I mean, as it is, they got confirmed [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3143.02s)]
*  by razor thin margins. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3144.9s)]
*  And so it was like, there just wasn't, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3146.82s)]
*  and again, there's a whole different battle [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3148.54s)]
*  to actually like the mechanism of government [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3151.6600000000003s)]
*  and entrenched interests and peeling those interests away. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3156.38s)]
*  But a prerequisite to even getting to this point [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3159.5s)]
*  was having this giant cultural awakening. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3163.78s)]
*  And now, you see where it's like, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3166.42s)]
*  a necessary component to this is that Bobby and Tulsi [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3169.98s)]
*  and Trump for that matter, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3174.5800000000004s)]
*  they got to know if they're going to war with the swamp, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3175.98s)]
*  that like the masses of the American people have their back. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3178.9s)]
*  And so like that's gotta be known. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3182.82s)]
*  And then also I would agree with your point [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3184.78s)]
*  about like complacence, but also patience, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3187.78s)]
*  like also understanding that like, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3190.5s)]
*  this thing was built up over many, many decades [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3192.46s)]
*  and it's not gonna be solved in a day or a year [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3195.94s)]
*  or in four years. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3198.6600000000003s)]
*  But look, we have the potential [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3199.94s)]
*  to actually see some positive change right now, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3202.38s)]
*  which feels very new from my perspective. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3204.46s)]
*  You're totally right. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3207.06s)]
*  That's why when I was sitting with Callie, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3208.26s)]
*  I had lost all hope, just because it's so entrenched [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3210.62s)]
*  and these special interests are so powerful. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3216.82s)]
*  And the reality is, you talk about it [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3219.94s)]
*  with military industrial complex [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3222.06s)]
*  and you understand all of this regime change. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3223.94s)]
*  And I listened to you talk, I'm like, whoa. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3226.6600000000003s)]
*  I learned so much from you. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3229.1s)]
*  And it's as corrupt and as deep as that in my line of work. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3232.02s)]
*  And if you even wanna take it a step further, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3238.1800000000003s)]
*  if we could put on our 10 hats for a second [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3242.06s)]
*  and go down the rabbit hole, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3244.58s)]
*  when you look at who owns the big ag companies, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3246.38s)]
*  the controlling share, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3250.38s)]
*  and then who owns the big food companies, controlling share. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3251.78s)]
*  Same for pharma, same for big insurance companies. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3255.1s)]
*  It's all the same companies. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3258.1400000000003s)]
*  It's BlackRock, it's Vanguard, State Street. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3262.54s)]

*  my point is that the reach is so great [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3267.58s)]
*  and the incentive is so powerful [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3271.98s)]
*  that it's gonna be easy. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3277.8999999999996s)]
*  It's definitely a David and Goliath story. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3279.54s)]

*  but it is like, stay woke, like stay aware, stay vigilant. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3287.06s)]
*  Don't allow yourself to be placated [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3292.38s)]
*  because they give up one out of 10,000 chemicals [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3293.86s)]

*  That is a snowflake on the tip of an iceberg. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3305.86s)]
*  And we don't have any idea [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3309.9s)]

*  It's bad. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3313.06s)]
*  It's as deep and scary as it can possibly get. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3314.62s)]
*  And it's absolutely by design [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3318.22s)]
*  that is not conspiracy theory or hyperbole. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3319.8599999999997s)]

*  but we need to stay in that head space. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3329.7s)]
*  That's all I'm saying is to stay very present and aware [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3331.74s)]
*  and not allow ourselves to be placated, be vigilant [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3336.5s)]
*  and be supportive like you're talking about [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIXHNWwKkuI&t=3339.66s)]
