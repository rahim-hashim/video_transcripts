# Dave Smith | Dan McKnight | Part Of The Problem 1278
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI)
*  Hey guys, thank you for tuning into a special episode of part of the problem and a special [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=0.0s)]
*  day in time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=12.68s)]
*  We have I'm very excited for this episode we have returning to the show, Dan McKnight, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=13.98s)]
*  who has really been doing heroic work over the last few years with defend the guard. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=18.48s)]
*  And there's really nobody who I could think of that would be better to talk to right now [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=23.36s)]
*  in this moment. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  So Mr. McKnight, how are you, sir? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=28.76s)]
*  Good, Dave. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=30.6s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=31.6s)]
*  It's good to see you again. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=32.6s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=33.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it has. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=34.6s)]
*  And unfortunately, the the warfare machine has not quite been been defeated. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=35.6s)]
*  I want to get into some stuff with defend the guard and and kind of the bigger picture [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  of what this grassroots movement that I think is is one of if not the most important grassroots [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  political movements in the country today. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=52.28s)]
*  Before we even get into that, I just want to ask you, as somebody who's served in in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  the war on terrorism, what this last week or two has been like for you as you see the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=60.2s)]
*  war beats the war drums beating for the next regime change war in the Middle East, the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=68.4s)]
*  seventh of Wesley Clark's seven countries in five years and the kind of the striking [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=74.2s)]
*  similarity to the the war drums beating in 2002 and 2003. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=80.72000000000001s)]
*  You know, I was listening to Fox News yesterday and a little bit earlier today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=86.28s)]
*  And I swear you could they they might have just been rerunning 2002 Fox News shows. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure I noticed some of the new cast of characters. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is definitely two thousand twenty five. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  But what's all of this been like from your perspective? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=99.76s)]
*  No, absolutely. They had to get the old scripts off and dust them off, right, and just hand [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=102.04s)]
*  them to the next blonde lady with a low cut shirt and let her read them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=105.4s)]
*  It's been an emotional rollercoaster, Dave. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=109.32s)]
*  We came into this season and I know you were there with us excited about having a president [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=112.32s)]
*  who was promising no new wars. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=117.6s)]
*  And then we see a war break out overnight, but we didn't have anything to do with it [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=119.36s)]
*  only to find out that maybe we had something to do with it, only to further find out that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=123.8s)]
*  maybe we provided the weaponry and only to find out later that, oh, yeah, we're also [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=128.28s)]
*  shooting down rockets in defense of another nation, only to find out later that it was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=132.48s)]
*  all a farce and we were just playing cover for them to be able to attack another country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=137.12s)]
*  So it's been an emotional rollercoaster. Those that have served in the global war on [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=142.0s)]
*  terror. We know firsthand what regime change war looks like and what it looks like is a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=144.68s)]
*  right rotten pile of garbage. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=149.32s)]
*  We haven't done one right ever. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=151.04s)]
*  We are we are terrible at this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  And since this is our seventh country, we're shooting the moon. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=154.96s)]
*  Wesley Clark had Clark had it right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  This is this clean sweep. If we get Iran done and we screw this one up, we've now screwed [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=158.96s)]
*  up all seven of them on our list. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=163.16s)]
*  And we call that in my industry, we call that perfection. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=164.88s)]
*  And so if that's what we're going for, complete failure, we're almost there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=168.12s)]
*  But we are disappointed. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=172.24s)]
*  We are frustrated to see that America has been drug into another endless undeclared [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=173.6s)]
*  war that Congress has advocated the responsibility and only principle people like Tom Massey [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=177.8s)]
*  or Rand Paul or Marjorie Taylor Greene are standing up to do anything about it only to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=182.52s)]
*  have people like Mark Levin call them constitutional idiots. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=186.56s)]
*  It's been disappointing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=190.84s)]
*  It's been frustrating. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=192.32s)]
*  But I'll tell you what, if we don't do something about this now, this will be our children's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=193.32s)]
*  problem to handle or our grandchildren. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=198.04s)]
*  And that's why we don't fight in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=200.16s)]
*  anymore. We fight in the states where we have a real chance to actually affect change. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, I completely understand that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=205.92s)]
*  And we'll get into the state level stuff, because of course, that's what Defend the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=207.88s)]
*  Guard is all about. But it really is something for somebody like Mark Levin, who [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=212.44s)]
*  whose argument is that he's a constitutional conservative, to be making a constitutional [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=218.72s)]
*  argument like President Trump just the other day was asked by reporters whether or not [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  he's going to directly attack Iran. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  And he said, I don't know. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=231.28s)]
*  That's nobody knows. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  And that's my decision to make alone. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=234.12s)]
*  Like, are you going to argue with me that that's what the framers intended for a president [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=236.08s)]
*  to sit there and say, that is my decision alone, whether or not I mean, they were so [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=241.56s)]
*  clear that the war making powers would be vested in the Congress and, you know, in [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=246.16s)]
*  theory, through the people. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=251.88s)]
*  And yet we, you know, even according to Benjamin Netanyahu himself, who is the biggest [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=253.8s)]
*  liar on the face of the planet when it comes to when Iran will develop nuclear weapons, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=259.8s)]
*  he's 0 for 70 in terms of those predictions. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=265.12s)]
*  But even he said in his interview with with Brett Baier just a couple of days ago that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=269.12s)]
*  he thinks they could be a year away from a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=274.8s)]
*  Now, this is not backed up by any of the experts. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  This is not backed up by any of the intelligence. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=280.8s)]
*  But even according to Benjamin Netanyahu, there's a year, a.k.a. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=282.6s)]
*  plenty of time to have a debate about this, plenty of time to get a congressional [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  declaration of war. And there's not, again, except for I think the three you mentioned, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=291.76s)]
*  and maybe there's one or two others. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=296.68s)]
*  But, you know, J.D. Vance and Matt Gaetz aren't in the Congress anymore. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=299.2s)]
*  So I don't know even who else it would be. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=302.48s)]
*  But we have all the time in the world to debate this in the Congress to have a declaration [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=304.44s)]
*  of war. And they're just like, no, we don't like doing it that way. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  So we'll let Donald Trump decide. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=312.08s)]
*  It's so you're absolutely right. And you talk about Mark Levin, such a little petulant [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=313.64s)]
*  man. He said that he ridiculed Tom Massie the other day. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  He called him little Tommy because Tom said, hey, President, you have the war powers [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  act from 1973. If you're going to do this, you have to report back to us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=328.11999999999995s)]
*  And Mark Levin had the audacity to say that Tom Massie doesn't know the Constitution [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=332.12s)]
*  because the War Powers Act is not in the Constitution. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=336.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, Mr. Levin, you're right. But you know what else isn't in the Constitution? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=338.96s)]
*  The president having the ability to take us to war without authority, also not in the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  Constitution. We just glance over that part. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  And so he's a petulant little man. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=349.12s)]
*  He wears one flag. It's blue and white. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  It's not red, white and blue. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=353.0s)]
*  And it is frustrating. But you're right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=354.64s)]
*  There is very few people in Congress that will stand up not only to Mark Levin, but [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=356.2s)]
*  to the president as well. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=359.92s)]
*  And to your point, there are National Guard troops right now on their way being [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=362.04s)]
*  positioned in the Middle East. There's over 30,000 troops in the Middle East. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=365.72s)]
*  Most of them, half of them, excuse me, I should be accurate, are from the National [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=368.8s)]
*  Guard of the states. And if we have time to respond to a real threat, is the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=372.12s)]
*  National Guard the force that we should be using to respond to that threat over [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=376.32s)]
*  time? No. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=379.92s)]
*  The president has the ability to respond in real time to real emergencies that are [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=381.32s)]
*  real threats and imminent right now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=384.44s)]
*  Anything that's a year out, two years out, five years out, or in Bibi's case, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=386.88s)]
*  30 years out, because that's what he's been saying for the last 30 years is that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=391.12s)]
*  they're three weeks away. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=394.64s)]
*  We should probably use the active duty military with the authority of the war [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  powers and have the president respond back to Congress. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=399.08s)]
*  But either way, your point is right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  There's time and we should be doing everything we can to avoid another war and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=403.44s)]
*  killing senseless people, whether they're Iranian or Israeli, it doesn't matter. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=406.84s)]
*  People are people and we should have a human approach to this and we should be [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  doing everything we can within the president's actual power to solve this [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=414.72s)]
*  issue. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=418.56s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=419.28000000000003s)]

*  I did not know that he had actually made the argument that the War Powers Act is [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  unconstitutional because that is true. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  But that's our argument. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=506.91999999999996s)]
*  That's not your argument. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=508.2s)]
*  The whole in fact, if for people who want to look into it, Murray Rothbard had a [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=509.64s)]
*  great piece I'd have to search to find it. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=513.16s)]
*  But maybe if you if you Google Murray Rothbard War Powers, you can find his [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=515.16s)]
*  piece on it. But yeah, he laid out the right. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. The point is the War Powers Act actually lets the president have 90 days [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=520.0s)]
*  of undeclared war, which is against the Constitution, where the Congress has to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=524.92s)]
*  declare it before the president can launch a war. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=528.28s)]
*  Anyway, that is wild that he actually made that argument using our argument [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  against us. He also uses the America First argument against the America First [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=534.52s)]
*  crowd saying that defense of Israel and letting them off their leash, letting the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=538.4s)]
*  junkyard dog loose is an America First approach because he says so. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=541.72s)]
*  Mark, you don't get to use you don't get to use the Horton rule against us, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=546.16s)]
*  Scott Horton's rule is you attack the right from the right and the left and the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=549.56s)]
*  left. Well, Mark, you misunderstand the principle. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=552.36s)]
*  You're not moving us further to the right. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=555.68s)]
*  You're moving us further to the center, the war party using right arguments. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=557.12s)]
*  And it just shows you that little angry man. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=560.6s)]
*  It's time for him to sail off into the sunset. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  And if he wants to live in the West Bank or someplace where he's truly aligned [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=564.24s)]
*  with the government, he should go do that because what he's living is not an [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=568.16s)]
*  America First life. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=571.12s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=572.6s)]
*  I couldn't think of anything that is less America First than launching an aggressive [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=574.28s)]
*  war of choice on behalf of a foreign country. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=580.36s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a pretty reasonable standard to say that is not what anybody [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=583.7199999999999s)]
*  ever meant by America First. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=587.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, one of the reasons why I always just loved the defend the guard concept [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=589.88s)]
*  and as it became like the movement that it has become is that it was it was [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=595.04s)]
*  something that was, you know, led by yourself, obviously at the top of the list [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=600.52s)]
*  there, but by combat vets. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=605.0s)]
*  And I remember back in, you know, I first got, you know, in all of these kind of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=607.68s)]
*  topics and interested in politics and foreign policy and these things during the Ron [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=614.56s)]
*  Paul presidential campaigns. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=618.52s)]
*  And I remember when it first came out in 2008, the first report that like their [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  financials were released and it showed that Ron Paul got more money from active [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=625.8s)]
*  duty military members than all the other candidates combined. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=630.4s)]
*  There was something like 12 other candidates in the Republican primary and they got [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=633.5999999999999s)]
*  more than Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=637.5999999999999s)]
*  It was more than all the other presidential candidates. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=639.3599999999999s)]
*  Active duty military were sending their money to the only guy who was saying, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=642.04s)]
*  let's end these wars right now. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  And of course, this is when it was in 2007, 2008. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  This was only, you know, a few years, although they were very bloody years, but [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=651.0799999999999s)]
*  only a few years into the war on terrorism. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=655.9599999999999s)]
*  And so I just think it's like incredibly powerful to point out that these guys like [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=658.32s)]
*  Mark Levin and Ben Shapiro and Douglas Murray and the whole rest of them are all a [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=664.2s)]
*  bunch of chicken hawks. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=669.6400000000001s)]
*  They all advocate for all of these wars, but never served in any of them. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=670.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, the American people don't want another war. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=674.0400000000001s)]
*  And then probably most importantly, the actual people who you're asking to make [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=677.08s)]
*  this ultimate sacrifice, they don't want to go to war anymore. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=681.6800000000001s)]
*  And I mean, that to me, I remember when I saw this in 2008, I was like, well, that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=686.2s)]
*  should be the end of the conversation right there. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=691.44s)]
*  I mean, why are we even continuing? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=693.5200000000001s)]
*  Like the boys who were asking to go do this don't want to go do it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=694.84s)]
*  So sorry, unless you guys want to go do it for them, you shouldn't get to fight [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  an elective war against the will of the people who have to go fight it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=702.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=706.6800000000001s)]
*  And you know, here's the thing about the military. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  We are, we're not a conflicted bunch. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=708.84s)]
*  Like a lot of people think we are. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=710.48s)]
*  We don't want to go to war, but if we do need to, and it's in the actual [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=712.0400000000001s)]
*  defense of our country, there is nobody that will stand up first and go [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=715.64s)]
*  charging into battle with proper authority, with respect for our constitution [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=719.3199999999999s)]
*  and willing to pay that price with everything up to and including [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=723.88s)]
*  the value of our own lives. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=726.8s)]
*  That's the military. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=728.24s)]
*  That's who we are. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=729.0s)]
*  We sign up for that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=730.04s)]
*  What we don't sign up for is to go guard oil wells in Syria and die in tower 22. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't sign up to shoot down drones over Israel that are being fired from, from Iran. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=736.04s)]
*  We don't sign up to fight all across the horn of Africa in the cocoa wars. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=742.12s)]
*  You know, there's, there's things going on around the world that the national [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=746.52s)]
*  guard, the military and general is being used for, and we didn't sign up for that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=749.0s)]
*  We signed up and sworn oath to defend the constitution of the United States [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=752.4000000000001s)]
*  against all enemies, foreign and domestic. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=755.64s)]
*  And if you want to talk about domestic enemies right now today, if anybody here [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=757.48s)]
*  caught Ted Cruz's conversation about why he went to the United States Senate, it [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=761.5600000000001s)]
*  was to promote and defend Israel first. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=766.44s)]
*  That was his initial campaign promises. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=770.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, Ted Cruz, you might be from the right, but you're not right. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=772.88s)]
*  And we will defend the constitution against those positions. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=776.68s)]
*  He is beheld or beholden to the, to APAC. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=779.6s)]
*  He defends them as a non-foreign lobbying organization. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=782.64s)]
*  And things like that are what put America's military in danger because he [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=786.04s)]
*  is beholden to somebody else, some other countries will, and it's going to put the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=790.04s)]
*  military in a place that they don't want to be and they shouldn't be. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=794.16s)]
*  And it's important that we recognize combat vets and people that have been [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  there do recognize that when we're going into these wars, if we're going to do it, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=800.0s)]
*  a couple of things need to happen. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=804.28s)]
*  Give us the right authority, give us a clear mission and a definition of success, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=805.56s)]
*  and then get the hell out of the way and let us do it and come back home. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=809.4s)]
*  Don't make us stay there and police their streets and build water facilities [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=812.4s)]
*  and schools for children. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=816.32s)]
*  Let us go win the war in it's defending America and let us come home. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=817.8s)]
*  That just doesn't happen anymore. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=821.12s)]
*  And we haven't done it since the last war that we actually won, world war II. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=822.12s)]
*  And the last thing I want to say on that is, is this when Ron Paul read for [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=825.8000000000001s)]
*  president, I had just come home from Afghanistan and I was pissed. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=830.0400000000001s)]
*  I was angry at America. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=832.5200000000001s)]
*  I was angry at the mission. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=833.96s)]
*  I was angry at our generals. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=834.96s)]
*  I thought that what we were doing there was a waste because I'd seen us change [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=836.44s)]
*  missions from shock and awe to counterinsurgency to winning the hearts and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=839.72s)]
*  minds to provincial reconstruction all in a year and a half while I was there. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=843.9200000000001s)]
*  And I was pissed when I got home and when I heard Ron Paul start talking about [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=847.96s)]
*  these things, I actually opened up my constitution and started reading and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=851.44s)]
*  following along. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=853.84s)]

*  It was an entire generation of pissed off vets. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=856.1600000000001s)]
*  The problem with today is that all those pissed off vets are no longer the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=858.76s)]
*  military. We now have 18, 19, 20 year old kids that have joined a military [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=861.6s)]
*  at a time when their entire life has been fought, been has been alive, has been [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=867.0s)]
*  fighting these endless wars. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=871.2800000000001s)]
*  They don't know anything but war. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=872.72s)]
*  And so when you ask these young privates, these young buck sergeants today, do you [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=874.1600000000001s)]
*  want to be fighting these wars? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=878.4000000000001s)]
*  They're cock-struck and ready to say, yeah, let's go fight them. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=880.08s)]
*  Let's go kick ass and do our jobs as military. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=882.52s)]
*  What they don't understand is the context or the history behind it. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=884.72s)]
*  And the founding fathers never intended for us to be in permanent occupying force. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=887.16s)]
*  Yeah. Amen. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, that's the there was something where I just I just felt like if we were [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=893.04s)]
*  a sane country, just not out of our minds, that the statements that you just [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=897.24s)]
*  mentioned that Ted Cruz said his reasons for wanting to be a senator and then [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=904.12s)]
*  further than that, saying like his biblical justification that God commands us [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=909.88s)]
*  to support Israel, which is, I mean, just logically speaking, it's on the name. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=915.08s)]
*  It's on the level of me naming my son Jesus Christ and then insisting that, look, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=919.32s)]
*  the Bible says that my son is your lord and savior. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=923.96s)]
*  It's like, no, you named him after the Bible saying that that wasn't what the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=926.9200000000001s)]
*  Bible was talking about. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=930.52s)]
*  But I do not think it's that much to ask. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=932.12s)]
*  And I'm a libertarian. I believe in like in in freedom and natural rights. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=934.28s)]
*  If you believe that your God has commanded you to support the state of Israel and if [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=938.36s)]
*  that's your major motivation in life, fine. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=944.2800000000001s)]
*  But you just get to be nowhere near any political power, let alone war making [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=946.44s)]
*  decisions. I mean, it's just too crazy. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=950.9200000000001s)]
*  As you know, I was thinking I was on a Piers Morgan the other day and it was after [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=953.24s)]
*  we had had booked this interview. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=957.24s)]
*  And this was another thing I was thinking about, like, what the perspective of this [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=959.32s)]
*  from a combat that must be. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=962.12s)]
*  But at one point, you know, he said, I forget exactly how we got to this, but I said, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=964.2s)]
*  you know, we're supporting all these regime changes. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=969.96s)]
*  I'm supposed to celebrate that Bashar al-Assad fell and now a member of Al Qaeda [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=972.44s)]
*  has taken over the country. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=978.52s)]
*  And he said something like he was like, well, you know, Nelson Mandela was on the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=980.84s)]
*  terrorist and then he ended up being a good leader and helping his country. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=984.76s)]
*  So we'll see where Jelani goes, you know. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=987.88s)]
*  And I'm like, well, wait a minute, you sold us this entire war on terrorism that it was [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=989.96s)]
*  that we were going to go take out Al Qaeda, the guys who took down the towers in my home [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=995.48s)]
*  city. And now you're telling me that in the latest phase of the war on terrorism, that [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1001.64s)]
*  actually look, you got to make up with Al Qaeda because Iran funds Hezbollah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1008.52s)]
*  And that's a problem for Israel. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1013.4s)]
*  So we got to take out the regime that fights wars against Al Qaeda side with Al Qaeda. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1014.84s)]
*  I mean, this is like, if you had said this, your point to the younger generation who [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1019.72s)]
*  wasn't alive for this time. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1023.8000000000001s)]
*  But if you had said this to the American people, let alone the American military in [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1025.08s)]
*  like, you know, December of 2001 or 2002 or 2003 or something that, oh, yeah, actually [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1030.52s)]
*  we're going to have to forgive and forget with Al Qaeda while we continue to fight these [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1037.56s)]
*  terror wars. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1041.8s)]
*  I just, I found it just a truly astounding ask of the American people. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1042.6000000000001s)]
*  And if you think about the guys have been there who have lost friends who've lost loved [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1047.24s)]
*  ones fighting Al Qaeda, fighting, fighting ISIS. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1050.1200000000001s)]
*  And now you look in Syria where we've got American dollars supporting ISIS in one [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1053.0s)]
*  faction. We've got American dollars supporting Al Assad in another faction. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1057.24s)]
*  We've got American dollars in intelligence supporting the rebels. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1060.8400000000001s)]
*  We've got American dollars and American boys shooting at American dollars and American [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1064.76s)]
*  boys all in support of an unclear mission and a regime change war that's clearly going [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1068.44s)]
*  to end terribly. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1072.76s)]
*  And if my friends are killed by ISIS and now we are supporting ISIS in another country, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1074.04s)]
*  not a different ISIS, not ISIS 2.0, literally the same damn ISIS, the same evil people, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1079.8799999999999s)]
*  the same leaders are now running a country with our support in our, in our, in our money. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1085.1599999999999s)]
*  It's frustrating at a micro level, at a macro level. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1091.24s)]
*  It's treasonous, if you ask me. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1095.08s)]
*  And when Al Assad fell in Syria in December, 48 to 53 percent of all the American boots [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1096.92s)]
*  on the ground were from the National Guard. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1104.3600000000001s)]
*  We weren't even there fighting a war. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1106.52s)]
*  We were using the National Guard to occupy a country that we had no business being in. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1107.64s)]
*  So this issue of Syria is very close to my heart. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1111.4s)]
*  And the last people that were injured, last American troops injured or killed in Afghan, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1114.04s)]
*  or excuse me, in Syria, were National Guardsmen from North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1117.4s)]
*  It's the National Guard has become the easy occupying button for a runaway foreign policy. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1122.76s)]
*  And it's time that we put an end to it. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1127.56s)]
*  It's just ridiculous. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1128.84s)]
*  And one last thing about your biblical reference. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1130.12s)]
*  The Old Testament did say, I will bless those that bless you, speaking to Abraham. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1132.44s)]
*  And that's been interpreted to say that they were talking about the nation of Israel. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1137.72s)]
*  Well, they weren't. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1140.92s)]
*  They were talking about the people of Israel at the time, a religious and an ethnic group. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1141.6399999999999s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1146.84s)]
*  If you're Christian, you believe that the Mosaic Law of the Old Testament was fulfilled when [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1148.44s)]
*  Jesus Christ came to earth. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1152.84s)]
*  And the New Testament now says that Israel is more about the people that follow Jesus [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1154.28s)]
*  and have turned their lives over to Jesus. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1159.48s)]
*  No offense, Dave, have the people of Israel, are they followers of Jesus Christ? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1162.44s)]
*  It's a minority. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1167.8s)]
*  They think he was a great man in most of the country, maybe even a prophet or a rabbi or a leader. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1170.84s)]
*  But I wouldn't say they've given their life to Jesus Christ. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1176.36s)]
*  And so the New Testament is clear. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1178.4399999999998s)]
*  The evangelicals have got this story all backwards. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1179.8s)]
*  And I'm not a super religious guy. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1183.0s)]
*  It took me 10 minutes to find that reference in a Bible on my own. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1185.08s)]
*  I knew that the New Testament replaced the laws of the Old Testament. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1188.12s)]
*  But I don't know how to make that argument because I don't wear a holy cloth around my neck. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1192.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1196.4399999999998s)]
*  No, I listen. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1197.08s)]
*  I agree with you on both counts. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1197.8s)]
*  I'm not a super religious person. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1200.04s)]
*  I mean, I believe in God, but I'm not like this book is [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1202.52s)]
*  right and this book is wrong kind of guy. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1206.12s)]
*  But I know enough to know that this argument is just completely ridiculous. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1209.1599999999999s)]
*  This is an absurd propaganda interpretation of the Bible. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1212.4399999999998s)]
*  And particularly if you particularly from a Christian point of view where, yeah, like this [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1217.7199999999998s)]
*  was already answered when Jesus came. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1223.08s)]
*  That's kind of the whole point of Christianity. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1225.8s)]
*  So let's let's get into a little bit because obviously we've had you on before to explain [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1229.7199999999998s)]
*  this and we've talked about it on the show before. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1233.7199999999998s)]
*  But just for anybody new who doesn't know just lay out what is the Defend the Guard [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1235.4s)]
*  movement all about? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1240.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1241.72s)]
*  The Fed, the Guard is a bill that's been around for a few years. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1242.0400000000002s)]
*  It's a piece of state based legislation. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1244.2s)]
*  We realized that we couldn't fight in Washington, D.C. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1246.2s)]
*  because nobody in D.C. would give the combat veterans the time of day. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1248.2800000000002s)]
*  So we left the swamps and we decided we were going to fight in Boise, Idaho and Bismarck [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1252.2s)]
*  and Phoenix and Tallahassee instead of in D.C. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1255.8000000000002s)]
*  And the Defend the Guard legislation says this essentially that the National Guard from the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1258.6000000000001s)]
*  state, whether it's Idaho or Arizona or Texas or wherever, shall not be released into federal [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1263.24s)]
*  service for the purpose of fighting in undeclared wars, period. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1268.1200000000001s)]
*  So what it says is Congress has to declare war before the National Guard can be activated. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1272.6s)]
*  It's a fail safe. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1276.76s)]
*  It's a pause, a moment in time when the governor and the legislatures of the state get to flip [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1278.04s)]
*  a middle finger to the broken rule of law. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1282.68s)]
*  You're not taking our sons and daughters, our teachers, our mechanics, our tradesmen, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1285.16s)]
*  our police officers who have volunteered to protect our state and our homeland to go [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1288.36s)]
*  fight in Qatar or Iraq or Syria or anywhere else in the Middle East or the Eastern Europe [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1292.52s)]
*  or Africa unless Congress has done it with the right authority. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1297.32s)]
*  Then the National Guard can be activated. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1300.84s)]
*  This is constitutional. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1302.76s)]
*  All we're doing is redefining the terms of the Constitution clearly in today's lexicon [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1304.2s)]
*  because it's been abused and mistreated. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1308.92s)]
*  We're not rewriting the law at all. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1311.32s)]
*  We're clarifying it and giving the governor legislative prohibition ability to tell the [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1312.92s)]
*  federal government to beat it, pound sand. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1317.0s)]
*  You're not taking our boys to go fight in some undeclared war. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1319.0s)]
*  And we've got it in over 30 states introduced now. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1321.72s)]
*  We've passed the Senate in Idaho. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1324.5200000000002s)]
*  We've passed the Senate in Arizona three times. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1326.2s)]
*  We've passed the House in New Hampshire and Virginia passed this year 99 to 0. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1328.2s)]
*  Full bipartisan support in the House. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1333.96s)]
*  And we're moving forward in Arizona. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1336.44s)]
*  It's waiting to go to the governor's desk right now. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1339.4s)]
*  It's being stonewalled by a quote, America first speaker of the House, Steve Montenegro [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1341.8000000000002s)]

*  It's already got the numbers. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1351.24s)]
*  We've already whipped the floor. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1352.28s)]
*  We know the vote count. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1353.24s)]
*  Senator Wendy Rogers has pushed it through the Senate three years in a row. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1354.68s)]
*  And each year it gets the House at Stonewalled. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1357.72s)]
*  And this year it's Steve Montenegro. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1359.56s)]

*  150 volunteers calling five minutes apart to one person's office. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1379.72s)]

*  You can change United States foreign policy. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1400.76s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1403.96s)]
*  And it's like really, it's such an important time to do something like this because you [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1405.08s)]
*  really do. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1409.48s)]
*  And look, I don't, again, I don't want to overstate this because we don't know exactly [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1410.04s)]
*  what's happening here. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1414.76s)]
*  But Donald Trump, just to be clear for everyone to kind of put some urgency behind this, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1416.28s)]
*  Donald Trump, first of all, I'll say this. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1421.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1425.64s)]
*  I had some sources on the inside who told me about 48 hours before Israel struck Iran, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1426.28s)]
*  that Israel was going to strike around. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1433.48s)]
*  And they did. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1435.56s)]
*  So the sources were correct on that. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1436.76s)]
*  The same sources told me. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1438.76s)]
*  Were you on the Atlantic Tweet thread or something? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1439.5600000000002s)]
*  I was not on the Atlantic Tweet thread, but I know some people who know some people. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1441.72s)]
*  And then the same sources told me that on Monday night, America was going to join in [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1445.24s)]
*  on the war and America was going to attack Iran. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1450.52s)]
*  Now, Monday night comes and Donald Trump posts this Evacuate Tehran tweet and then had his [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1453.0800000000002s)]
*  thing about unconditional surrender. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1459.8s)]
*  And so when I saw that, I went, oh, wow, this is the information I got was correct. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1462.04s)]
*  America is joining the war. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1466.76s)]
*  This is it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1467.8s)]
*  It's happening right now. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1468.36s)]
*  That didn't end up happening. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1469.32s)]
*  And now it's being reported that Donald Trump is taking a week to two weeks to make his [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1470.68s)]
*  decision over whether the US will formally, as if we're not already in, but will formally [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1475.48s)]
*  enter the war. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1480.52s)]
*  And I'm just saying that it is a plausible thought here that the fact that so many people [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1481.48s)]
*  with tremendous influence, like spoke out against this war. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1487.72s)]
*  And I'm not talking about me. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1491.8s)]
*  I'm talking about Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson and Charlie Kirk and Marjorie Taylor [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1493.1599999999999s)]
*  green. And as you mentioned, Thomas Massey and Rand Paul and Alex Jones and Candace Owens [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1498.84s)]
*  and I'm sorry, Matt Gates, Matt. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1504.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1507.0s)]
*  Matt Gates was phenomenal on this. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1507.3999999999999s)]
*  And I'm probably missing a few others. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1509.8s)]
*  I, but Charlie Kirk was actually very good on this. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1511.24s)]
*  And so when you put all of those guys together, you're talking about a huge percentage of [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1514.28s)]
*  the influential people in the MAGA world and Trump's own base. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1520.92s)]
*  And what that does is it lets Donald Trump know that this is going to be incredibly [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1524.8400000000001s)]
*  politically costly for him to do this. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1530.68s)]
*  This might be the thing that has prevented this strike from happening already. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1533.3200000000002s)]
*  And if they are aware that there is a grassroots movement of combat vets who are dead set [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1537.72s)]
*  against the being used in this way. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1545.5600000000002s)]
*  Like I'm just saying, making these phone calls right now, you really cannot overstate how [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1548.68s)]
*  important it is. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1554.8400000000001s)]
*  This could be the difference between another catastrophic regime change war and avoiding [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1555.64s)]
*  one. Look, if they know that they're like the national guard themselves is just does [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1561.0s)]
*  not want to be used. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1567.0800000000002s)]
*  Or even if there are legislative victories and can't be used in this way. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1568.44s)]
*  Again, this could be the difference. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1571.4s)]
*  These are politicians we're talking about. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1573.32s)]
*  After all, they respond to political incentives. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1575.16s)]
*  Now, of course, they might respond to big money incentives even more. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1577.4s)]
*  But if the political incentive is strong enough, you can move these things as I'm sure you [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1581.5600000000002s)]
*  remember well. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1586.0400000000002s)]
*  Barack Obama announced that we were going into Syria to do a regime change war there. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1587.64s)]
*  And it was the pressure from active duty military members, this massive internet campaign of [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1592.1200000000001s)]
*  active duty military guys saying, I will not go die for Al Qaeda fighting for Al Qaeda [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1598.44s)]
*  in Syria that ultimately stopped him from doing that. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1603.5600000000002s)]
*  Now, look, he ultimately got the regime change anyway. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1606.12s)]
*  We fought a dirty war there. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1609.56s)]
*  But still, that was a heck of a lot better than having another Iraq or Afghanistan on [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1611.2399999999998s)]
*  our hands. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1615.3999999999999s)]
*  And so just just saying like, look, I'm not trying to I'm not trying to be like pie in [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1615.9599999999998s)]
*  the sky here and pretend that the people really have all of the power or something like that. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1622.04s)]
*  But there is some degree of power that the people have. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1627.3999999999999s)]
*  And this is the time to exercise it like no better, no more important time than this. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1629.9599999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1634.6000000000001s)]
*  And if you look at this, where society is at today, first, I want to actually address [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1635.0s)]
*  that last point. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1638.52s)]
*  The power is with the people. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1639.64s)]
*  We just have to take it back. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1640.6000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1641.88s)]
*  It's there. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1642.2s)]
*  It's ours. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1642.68s)]
*  We have given all the authority to Congress who has then abdicated and given away the president. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1643.24s)]
*  The only way we're going to fix that is if we take it back. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1647.3200000000002s)]
*  And the only way we take it back is by taking action. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1649.16s)]
*  So you look in today's society right now, we've got the no kings riots in thousands [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1651.48s)]
*  of cities across the country, the National Guard being deployed to the border for border [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1655.48s)]
*  security being called into the streets of LA. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1658.52s)]
*  And then you look in Arizona where the National Guard, where the governor there [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1661.24s)]
*  signed a treaty with the Sultan of Oman to defend their border against Yemen. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1664.36s)]
*  So the National Guard is being split all over the world, not only fighting in endless wars, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1668.52s)]
*  but also protecting other nations against potential enemies. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1672.36s)]
*  They're protecting our own southern border. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1675.8799999999999s)]
*  They're enforcing the rule of law, possibly violating the posse commentatus. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1677.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think so, but some people do. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1680.76s)]
*  That was my best Donald Trump impersonation. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1682.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't think that others do. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1684.12s)]
*  So what better time was there to use the National Guard as the cudgel to force a correction? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1686.6799999999998s)]
*  Right now, the National Guard is the only constitutional mechanism that we have to [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1691.32s)]
*  defend the homeland, to enforce the rule of law, to keep these rioters off the streets [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1695.8799999999999s)]
*  and throwing bricks and cars off of overpasses and burning down buildings and dumpsters and [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1701.8799999999999s)]
*  just creating chaos. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1707.24s)]
*  The National Guard is our mechanism. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1708.6s)]
*  They should be home to repel an invasion, to put down an insurrection, to enforce the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1710.4399999999998s)]
*  laws of the union. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1713.96s)]
*  That's what it says in the Constitution. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1715.08s)]
*  You know what it doesn't say? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1716.6s)]
*  Fighting undeclared wars overseas. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1718.12s)]
*  It doesn't say it at all. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1720.04s)]
*  The National Guard is here to defend America and our home interests. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1721.8s)]
*  When you talk about the movement of active duty military being the ones that pulled the [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1725.0s)]
*  rug from underneath President Obama, it's exactly right. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1728.6s)]
*  That campaign caught fire and it was wild how fast it happened. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1731.32s)]
*  We're doing the same thing right now. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1735.48s)]
*  We're using veterans with skin in the game, skin in the game and maybe even a limb lost, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1737.1599999999999s)]
*  to tell their stories and say, it is no longer my obligation to fight your undeclared and [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1742.04s)]
*  endless wars and it won't be my children's or my grandchildren's. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1748.6s)]
*  Legacy members of the military, families that have served for generations, are backing out [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1751.8799999999999s)]
*  and saying, no more, not until we get this fixed. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1756.04s)]
*  And it's a sad state of affairs when people in your country who have proudly served the [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1758.76s)]
*  military in the past are waking up to recognize that they're nothing more than a pawn in the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1762.28s)]
*  defense military contractors puppet show. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1766.6s)]
*  No longer. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1769.9599999999998s)]
*  It's time to put an end to it and the only way we can do it is through the Defend the [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1770.6799999999998s)]
*  Guard movement and there's only one opportunity left this year and it's in Arizona. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1773.48s)]
*  If it doesn't happen in Arizona this year, it doesn't happen anywhere until next January [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1777.72s)]
*  at the earliest and you want to talk about the ground support. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1781.24s)]
*  We got Defend the Guard on the ballot in Texas in the Republican primary, asking Republican [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1784.6000000000001s)]
*  voters what they thought of the Defend the Guard movement and it passed with 83% support. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1789.56s)]
*  It outperformed Donald Trump. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1794.44s)]
*  They got 60,000 more votes than Donald Trump. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1795.88s)]
*  Funny part about it is, Dave, the no votes on Defend the Guard in Texas matched almost [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1799.32s)]
*  identically the same number of votes that Nikki Haley got for president on the same [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1804.04s)]
*  ballot. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1808.68s)]
*  So you want to talk about where the political alignment, where the separation is. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1809.32s)]
*  The MAGA movement is anti-war. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1813.08s)]
*  We are anti-war until it's time to go to war and then when it's time to go to war, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1815.8s)]
*  we will do it constitutionally and then we're going to go in and we're going to [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1819.8s)]
*  defend America and we're going to kick ass and come home. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1822.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the it's one of the great tragedies of our time of my lifetime is that [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1824.92s)]
*  you have this and again, I'm not trying to paint like with a broad brush, like obviously [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1832.92s)]
*  like there are there are troubled people who go into the military and there are people who [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1837.48s)]
*  go into the military, you know, for maybe not the best intentions, but there are so many [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1841.64s)]
*  of these young men who go into the military with the noblest of intentions with the idea that like [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1846.92s)]
*  I would put my life on the line to make sure that like you and your little sister and your [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1852.52s)]
*  mother and your daughter are protected and don't have to, you know, like and and then [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1858.04s)]
*  if there was a time when you had to do that and someone really threatened our country, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1862.76s)]
*  those brave young men are what you need for your society to survive and throughout all of human [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1866.68s)]
*  history, that's how society societies only survive if they have these brave young men who are willing [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1871.6399999999999s)]
*  to risk it all in order to protect their societies and to watch that be manipulated, you know, for the [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1876.84s)]
*  interests of foreign countries and bankers and weapons manufacturers and watch this this like [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1882.68s)]
*  it's something out of like a Greek tragedy to watch the most noblest of of of instincts in [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1889.24s)]
*  humans be manipulated for these like most evil of ends. It's just man, there is a place in hell [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1894.8400000000001s)]
*  for the people who are orchestrating that. One of the greatest warriors ever to serve in the [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1903.64s)]
*  American military wrote a little pamphlet, right? War is a racket. It's Medley Butler, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1906.76s)]
*  two-time. I got it right here on my shelf. Yeah, right. Yep. It's right here. In fact, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1910.6s)]
*  I've got a little statue back here next to Thomas Aquinas of Smendley Butler. He's a he's an absolute [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1914.36s)]
*  hero of mine. But you talk about the the honor of people that join the military willing to stand up [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1919.32s)]
*  for this almost altruistic viewpoint that I'm going to defend America, my mom, your sister, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1924.84s)]
*  all of it. I'm going to do it. It's going to be on my shoulders. I was that same guy in 2005 when [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1929.8799999999999s)]
*  we were getting ready to go to Afghanistan, me and seven of my buddies, we were in Fort Hood, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1934.6799999999998s)]
*  Texas training getting ready to go. Well, Fort Hood happens to be just a couple hour drive from [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1937.96s)]
*  Crawford, Texas. And what's in Crawford, Texas? You ask President George W. Bush's ranch. We were [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1942.6000000000001s)]
*  so bought into the mission. Seven of us bought a used van for 1500 bucks, snuck off base on a [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1948.2s)]
*  weekend Liberty pass. And we drove to Fort to Crawford, Texas to go tell President Bush we were [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1954.3600000000001s)]
*  going to win his war for him. That's how Pollyanna we were. That's how altruistic we were. We got to [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1959.48s)]
*  the gate and of course, Secret Service stops at the gate. But they radioed back to that house and [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1964.28s)]
*  asked him to come outside and wave at us. And he he did. You couldn't see the door, but they told [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1969.24s)]
*  us he waved and got we were ready to go. I was ready to go catch a bullet for that man. And then [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1973.08s)]
*  I got there and realized nobody knew what we were doing. And then a few years later, I read the [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1977.8s)]
*  Afghanistan papers where he didn't even know who the commanding general in Afghanistan was, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1981.3999999999999s)]
*  because he was busy jerking off his dad and dealing with Iraq. He'd taken his eyes off the prize. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1985.3999999999999s)]
*  So you talk about that honor. A lot of young military men are they buy into the mission, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1991.1599999999999s)]
*  they buy into the red, white and blue and the apple pie and baseball and spreading democracy. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1995.0s)]
*  And we believe it. And then at the end of your career, you look back, you're like, we didn't do [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=1999.1599999999999s)]
*  any of it. We didn't do any of it. We got played. And the only way to restore that honor is to get [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2002.6799999999998s)]
*  rid of these these people like Lindsey Graham, who, by the way, who has a bronze star from combat, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2007.8799999999999s)]
*  even though he was a lawyer in the Air Force, I don't know how we got a bronze star for valor in [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2013.7199999999998s)]
*  combat. This is what happened to the military. Everybody gets to come home with a chest full [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2018.04s)]
*  of ribbons so that they can justify the purity of the mission that they went on. And we just got to [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2021.24s)]
*  stop. We've got to get back to being warriors. And every war that America has ever won has been on [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2026.2s)]
*  the backs of corn fed Midwestern men, not pansies from inner cities, not some weird cultural society. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2031.72s)]
*  The woke, I can't even call it what I want. It's been on the back of corn fed men. And we've got [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2040.84s)]
*  to get back to that again. Once again, the only way to do that is to get rid of some of the culture [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2047.7199999999998s)]
*  problems we have that started in Washington, DC. Yeah, no, that's, that's 100% right. And it's, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2051.56s)]
*  it's funny as like, as the, you know, like, look, obviously over the last year, there's been kind of [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2056.92s)]
*  like a turn in the culture wars. And some people feel like, you know, the woke insanity is receding [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2061.72s)]
*  a little bit, but like, if you're wondering even why it rose up so much to begin with, it's like, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2067.48s)]
*  well, maybe, I don't know, maybe it's because we took all of our brave young men and threw them in [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2073.32s)]
*  the, in this meat grinder of these forever catastrophe wars that don't aren't even, you know, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2078.84s)]
*  the thing is like the lies, like, it's just so unbelievable the way that it just watching it [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2084.44s)]
*  over the last, the last week, particularly, but the way they just, it's like, it really does bring [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2089.72s)]
*  me back to 2002, 2003, because they'll say these things that are like, okay, it's not even [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2095.16s)]
*  technically a lie, but you said it in such a misleading way. Like I had someone arguing with me [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2101.96s)]
*  on online that they go, the phrase was, they said, I think that you might be right that Iran doesn't [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2106.8399999999997s)]
*  have nuclear weapons, but I think it's inevitable that they eventually well. And you're like, wait, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2116.68s)]
*  it's inevitable that every nation eventually will have nuclear weapons in this non falsifiable [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2123.8s)]
*  counterfactual, but wait, hold on. What's the actual evidence right now? Oh, the list. Like he [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2129.96s)]
*  technically didn't say a lie, but it's just like so misleading. And you're like, wait, but do they [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2134.76s)]
*  have nuclear weapons right now? Oh, all of the intelligence says they do not, and that they're [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2139.0800000000004s)]
*  not pursuing them. Oh, okay. So sorry, bullshit lie off the table. And it's just, there's something [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2142.76s)]
*  like, and I think this is something that, you know, look, even, even for somebody like me, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2148.2000000000003s)]
*  who's very anti war and talks about this stuff all the time, it's like hearing you tell this story [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2152.36s)]
*  about you and your buddies being gung ho and going to just to want to get away from the president, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2157.48s)]

*  of this, you just, you know, it's a reminder that like these lies, you know, lies are lies and [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2167.6400000000003s)]
*  everybody tells some lies. And obviously in politics, there's lies, you know, that are told [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2173.2400000000002s)]
*  all the time, but it's like, you're like intentionally spreading lies that are going to [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2177.32s)]
*  get other people killed that are going to get other people to kill other people, to do horrific [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2182.28s)]
*  things to other people that they otherwise would have no problem with. You're going to leave, you [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2188.84s)]
*  know, you're leaving a little three year old boys and girls without dads or with a dad who's got a [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2192.76s)]
*  limb blown off. I mean, this is just like, it's, it's so consequential, these lies and the way [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2198.6000000000004s)]
*  people throw them out so flippantly without really like thinking about the weight of, of what the, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2203.08s)]
*  the ramifications of this policy are going to be. And then the way they talk about it, like, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2209.0s)]
*  it's all going to be so easy. You know, it's, we'll be greeted as liberators again. It's like they, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2213.96s)]
*  they seem to have like no interest in even attempting to understand the actual dynamics [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2219.64s)]
*  on the ground of what doing something like this is going to look like. That's right. And that [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2224.44s)]
*  flippant comment you made is so true. When we talk, the biggest objection we get from the, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2228.76s)]
*  from the military industrial complex or the, the neocon war hawks for defend the guard is that [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2232.76s)]
*  when people sign up for the military, they want to go to war. They know what they're getting into. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2237.96s)]
*  That is so flippant coming from somebody that sits behind a desk with a fancy tie. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2243.1600000000003s)]
*  Look, nobody wants to go to war. And if they do, we probably wouldn't want them in the military. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2247.2400000000002s)]
*  That's not who we want. And also we forget this. We put civilians in control of the military for a [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2251.4s)]
*  purpose in this country to keep young testosterone driven young men from marching headlong into every [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2257.24s)]

*  when we were in the military, you go looking for a fight because that's what we do. You don't want [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2266.3599999999997s)]
*  a young 19, 20, 21 year old with not a fully developed brain making decisions about whether [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2270.7599999999998s)]
*  or not they want to go to war and then letting them do it just because, right? We have to be [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2276.04s)]
*  restrained and that's why we have people in charge of the military. And we look now to the [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2280.3599999999997s)]
*  leadership of the military. You can debate about his efficacy, but you look at Pete Hegseth right [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2284.68s)]
*  now, he's preaching our song. And guess what's happened to him in the last two weeks regarding [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2289.8799999999997s)]
*  Israel and Iran? Have you heard from him? He's kind of been silenced. He's been put in the corner. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2294.2s)]
*  Pete Hegseth is a big supporter of Defend the Guard. He actually came out and endorsed it last [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2299.8799999999997s)]
*  January. And I think he understands the concept. I think he might be one of the last few anti-war [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2303.24s)]
*  voices that's still inside the administration. Tulsi Gabbard has been backbenched also. We [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2309.72s)]
*  haven't heard from her in quite some time. By the way, I'm going to say this out loud and proud. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2313.8s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard might be one of the greatest men in the military. Is that offensive? I don't know, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2318.1200000000003s)]
*  but she's one of the greatest warriors I know because she fights for principles over mission [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2322.44s)]
*  adherence to some politician. But there are people in the administration that still have [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2329.0s)]
*  the presidents here. You talk about all the influencers, Charlie Kirk and Bannon and Tucker [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2332.76s)]
*  Carlson, Jack Posobik, who is also a combat vet. I should have mentioned him. Yeah. There are some [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2336.84s)]
*  of the greatest voices. And if you look back at their influence over the 2024 election, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2342.2s)]
*  President Trump does not get elected without those groups, without Charlie Kirk and Turning [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2346.7599999999998s)]
*  Point USA, without bringing our troops home in the Defend the Guard movement, without Jack Posobik, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2351.0s)]
*  without Tucker Carlson. He doesn't win. And so he should be listening to those people. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2355.56s)]
*  In this one or two week pause, I'll take it. I'll take it. And we're going to continue doing [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2361.3999999999996s)]
*  what we've been doing. We've been threading this needle. Mr. President, use every ounce of diplomacy [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2366.12s)]
*  you have. And if you make the decision to go to war, we beg you, we beg you go to Congress, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2371.08s)]
*  go to Congress and make them put their name on the line. Go to war with the informed consent of [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2376.92s)]
*  every congressional district in America before you take that action. The president does have [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2381.96s)]
*  the ability to respond to a threat. He should and can defend America. But Iran does not have a missile [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2387.64s)]
*  that can barely reach the far side of Israel. They definitely don't have one that's going to [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2392.92s)]
*  reach all the way across the Pacific or the Atlantic, whichever direction you decide to go, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2396.44s)]
*  or if the earth is flat, I guess it would be to the left. They don't have one of those missiles. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2400.36s)]
*  So our imminent threat to America is only because we have troops positioned surrounding them. And [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2404.84s)]
*  then we've attacked every one of their neighbors and relentlessly beat them back into the third [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2410.28s)]
*  world. Yeah, it's really something. You know, I was saying it's funny. And I love the way you put it [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2414.6800000000003s)]
*  because there's no mistaking this because there was, I remember particularly before Ron Paul. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2421.0s)]
*  And then of course, once Donald Trump started taking on some of these anti-war talking points, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2426.76s)]
*  this kind of receded. But for years, it would kind of be like, if you were to like make an [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2430.76s)]
*  argument like this, it's the the attack would be like, oh, so you're blaming America. You're [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2436.6800000000003s)]
*  on the side of Iran rather than being on the side of America, which is pretty impossible to do when [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2442.28s)]
*  you're talking to somebody who actually voluntarily signed up and risked their own life to go defend [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2447.32s)]
*  the United States of America. She makes it a lot. I mean, they might still try like Larry Elder was [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2451.48s)]
*  the black face of white supremacy or something like that. But it does make it it makes it a [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2455.8s)]
*  tougher sell for sure. And there is something where, you know, again, I've tried to kind of [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2459.48s)]
*  drive this point home, but so much will be made of the, you know, Iran chants death to America. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2465.6400000000003s)]
*  And it's like, oh, well, I mean, we they chance do they well, then I mean, I guess we have to go see [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2473.1600000000003s)]
*  about these chants. And look, I am just saying, I am an American, my only loyalty is to the United [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2477.7200000000003s)]
*  States of America. I could care less about the Iranian government. Like I'm a I'm a Jewish [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2483.56s)]
*  libertarian. What do I what do I have in common with the mullahs? You know what I mean? Like this, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2488.2s)]
*  like they're not my people. But at the same time, I also learned the lesson of Frederick Bastia [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2492.2799999999997s)]
*  that there is a difference between your society and your government, which also could be a lesson [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2500.12s)]
*  of the Declaration of Independence, like governments are just something the people create [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2504.68s)]
*  to protect rights. They're not like gods or kings. And they're not the same as our society. I'm loyal [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2508.44s)]
*  to America. I'm not loyal to the American government. And if you're going to tell me [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2513.16s)]
*  that the part of the justification here is that they've made threats. It's like, well, then I just [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2517.48s)]
*  demand we be consistent and objective and go, but what about the threats that we've made toward [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2523.48s)]
*  Iran? We put them on the axis of evil after 9-11, even though they had nothing to do with 9-11. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2527.7999999999997s)]
*  We then invaded and destroyed the two neighboring countries that touch it. So that might seem like [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2532.6s)]
*  kind of a threat to them. Maybe we should all like, sure, if you want to say threats are bad, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2537.7999999999997s)]
*  okay, yes, that's true. It's not good when people make these threats willy nilly. It's, you know, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2542.76s)]
*  okay, it's not good. Not good for de-escalation, which always should be the goal. But let's put [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2547.7200000000003s)]
*  this in perspective. How about the threats America's made to Iran? How about the threats [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2553.4s)]
*  Israel's made to Iran? We're supposed to like sit here. And while all of the most powerful [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2557.2400000000002s)]
*  governments in the world are threatening the very existence of this country, I'm to judge them for [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2562.1200000000003s)]
*  if they have some bombastic language coming back. It just seems crazy. No, absolutely. And if you, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2566.76s)]
*  just to go to the north a little bit to the Ukraine conflict, we think about the warning [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2572.12s)]
*  that we got that yet means yet, right? Not one inch further to the east. If we push NATO into [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2575.4s)]
*  Russia, Russia will respond. We've known it since the 90s, right? So we do have some responsibility [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2580.68s)]
*  for the reaction that we receive from other people. If we choose hostility, or if we choose force, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2586.2s)]
*  and force is thrust upon us, that's what's going to happen. That's just the that's the byproduct of [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2590.7599999999998s)]
*  our actions. And it's so it's treated as so anti American to question our own motives. It's, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2595.24s)]
*  I like to always think about it in my own context. If Ukraine, Russia, China, Iran, whoever, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2601.48s)]
*  were to invade Mexico, Canada, Cuba, oh my god, that actually happened, and put missiles on our [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2608.92s)]
*  borders, what would we do in response as Americans? Well, let's push that even further. What if China [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2615.56s)]
*  built a military base deep inside of Nevada? What would we do as I live in Idaho, that's right to [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2621.72s)]
*  myself, what would I do? Should I be down there with my hunting rifle? Right? You want to talk [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2626.36s)]
*  about a war? America would be an insurgency, we would be the insurgents fighting against the [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2629.88s)]
*  occupying force. Now, I do believe that we have some greater honor. America is the greatest country [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2634.84s)]
*  on the face of the earth, the greatest superpower. We do have, I believe, a divinely inspired [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2640.2000000000003s)]
*  constitution. I think our government is corrupt as they come, but our constitution is divinely inspired. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2644.6s)]
*  We should be demonstrating that might and that superiority and that moral high ground inside of [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2649.48s)]
*  our country. Instead of sending people to go fight in Iran or defend Israel's right to fight [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2654.68s)]
*  against Iran or Ukraine or the Congo, how about we fight to keep people off our home, our streets at [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2659.72s)]
*  home? We fight to spend our money to end homelessness and drug addiction and violence and crime and gangs [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2666.04s)]
*  and all the other stuff that our country is doing wrong. Tucker talked about this with Ted Cruz the [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2673.48s)]
*  other day. What have you ever said about the homeless person you've stepped over getting off [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2678.7599999999998s)]
*  a union station on your walk to work in Washington, DC? How about you do something about that? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2682.36s)]
*  That is, DC is something that the Congress actually controls. They can actually fix that problem [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2687.2400000000002s)]
*  in DC, but they're so busy focusing on all the other countries around the world and flexing our [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2692.44s)]
*  might and spending our cash that they can't even do the one simple thing. Make the walk from union [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2696.92s)]
*  station to Capitol Hill safe. It seems like a really small lift. Yeah, 100%. I mean, look, I've [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2701.48s)]
*  subscribed to like, I guess my own version of a just war theory. And I think wars of choice are [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2708.6s)]
*  immoral and I don't think you should ever get into one. I think it's kind of obvious to me just as [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2714.36s)]
*  like the most basic human moral calculation that if you're going to ever launch a war, you only do [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2720.2s)]
*  it when you absolutely need to do it. And there is no other option, but let's just say that there is [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2726.2s)]
*  a time where you would opt to launch a war of choice. Like, okay, let's say I were to concede [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2732.04s)]
*  that point. Well, like when your country's $37 trillion in debt and you got a hundred thousand [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2738.36s)]
*  drug overdoses a year and we've had maybe 10 million illegal immigrants come into our country [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2744.12s)]
*  in the last four or five years and have the worst political and tribal and racial and divisions of [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2749.88s)]
*  my lifetime, that certainly wouldn't be the time that you launch a war of choice. You know, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2757.56s)]
*  that's a time when you pay attention to some of the problems you got at home. So I completely [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2763.16s)]
*  agree with that. Hey, I want, I wanted to ask you about this before we're done. Cause I did think [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2767.24s)]
*  one, another one of the elements, which again is very consistent with all the war propaganda of [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2773.48s)]
*  the last 25 years, but one of the elements that I've found truly unbelievable. I find it, I find it [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2778.44s)]
*  unbelievable that the, the talking point is weapons of mass destruction. 2.0 that's, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2784.92s)]
*  that's pretty unbelievable. But the other one that might even be more outrageous is that it's, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2790.36s)]
*  that nation building here will be, or regime change will be easy here. And that, you know, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2796.84s)]
*  that this won't require us troops on the ground and that the people of Iran hate their government [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2802.44s)]
*  and therefore they will embrace, I guess this hasn't formally been proposed, but certainly [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2809.0s)]
*  implied that the son of the Shaw will be we're now Dan, we're now making the world safe for [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2814.12s)]
*  monarchy. Maybe that'll read again. Right, right. Maybe, maybe spreading monarchy will work out that. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2821.0s)]
*  And it's really funny that I've actually heard a few of the Hawks refer to him as the rightful [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2826.2s)]
*  leader of Afghanistan. So we, because he's the son of the person who the CIA put in power in 1953. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2831.16s)]
*  So we are now hereditary monarchists, evidently. But, but as somebody who was, okay, look, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2837.56s)]
*  Afghanistan is a different country than Iran. I'm not saying that there aren't different dynamics, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2844.84s)]
*  but they are their next door neighbor. And as somebody who was a part of like a nation building [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2848.6s)]
*  effort in Afghanistan, what do you think about this? When you hear people going like, oh, the [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2853.0s)]
*  logistics of this will be no problem at all. This regime falls a real great guy. I'll take over. And [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2858.6s)]
*  then there'll be more harmony in the region. What do you think? Look, first of all, we're talking [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2863.88s)]
*  about anywhere between 90 and 100 million people in Iran. It's not Afghanistan. It's not Iraq. It's [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2870.2000000000003s)]
*  more than double the size of those countries. Also, if the law, if the war is launched from the, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2875.8s)]
*  from the Gulf or from Israel, there's not a single fighter bomber that can make it there and back [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2880.52s)]
*  in a single in a trip. So guess what happens now? Now the National Guard, which owns most of the air [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2885.08s)]
*  refueling mission for the United States military is deploying all their KC-135s over there right [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2890.2s)]
*  now to occupy the skies and provide mobile gas stations. So the, the logistics of us to fight a [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2894.7599999999998s)]
*  war in Iran are infinitely different. We do not have a beachfront in Iran. We would be fighting [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2900.3599999999997s)]
*  from several thousand miles away and the sorties would be just way more complicated. Next, we also [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2905.56s)]
*  know this, there has never been a war that's been won, peace that has been surrendered or anything [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2911.08s)]
*  without boots on the ground. So whose boots are they going to be and where are they going to come [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2916.3599999999997s)]
*  from? Are we going to fight from Afghanistan as our base? I don't know. Then you're going to fight [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2919.64s)]
*  from, you're going to be fighting people from two directions. Are we going to be fighting from Iraq? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2923.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't think so because Iran, their regime and Hezbollah and all of their proxies are in Iraq [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2927.08s)]
*  right now running that country. Where are we going to fight this war from? What's our beachhead? And [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2933.08s)]
*  there was a report out just a couple of weeks ago. I was just talking to Doug McGregor about this the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2938.04s)]
*  other day. There's a Marine Corps general that has said the Marine Corps is no longer capable of [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2942.44s)]
*  fighting as an amphibious mobile warfare unit. They no longer have the capacity to fight [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2946.44s)]
*  from the sea onto land. It's not their mission anymore. So what's the war going to look like [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2951.88s)]
*  and where's it going to come from? Another great military strategist that I know, he's a representative [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2957.2400000000002s)]
*  in the Idaho legislature now. He was a 38 year naval aviator. He was the longest serving Navy [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2962.36s)]
*  pilot in US history. He was the opposition force for the United States military. He played China, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2967.7200000000003s)]
*  he played Russia in all the war games against the United States and he's undefeated. He's never been [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2973.32s)]
*  beaten by the United States. He said that our carrier groups, if we actually launched a war [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2978.04s)]
*  into Iran and if China were to join that war, our carrier groups and our modern F-35s and F-22s [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2982.76s)]
*  would be gone and useless by the end of the first day. The first day and he knows because he's the [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2989.48s)]
*  strategist that does it. And so what would the war look like? I don't know. Would it be like horseback [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=2995.0800000000004s)]
*  in Afghanistan when the first, when the war first started? I don't know. Would it be trying [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3001.32s)]
*  to revive the M1 Abram tanks that we have taken out of our inventory? Would we be driving across [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3005.56s)]
*  the Silk Road to try and get into Iran from some safe place? You tell me. I'm sure there's a plan [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3010.76s)]
*  in the Pentagon somewhere. I'm sure it makes sense because some young butterbar lieutenant probably [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3016.76s)]
*  kissed some colonel's ass to get it done with a proper PowerPoint presentation. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3022.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't know what it looks like, but it would not be near what it was in Iraq when we invaded from [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3026.92s)]
*  Kuwait and it wouldn't be what it was in Afghanistan when we had a foothold in the North with Masarash [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3032.76s)]
*  Sharif. Yeah. Yeah. So in other words, the risks of this war just make the risks of all the previous [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3036.44s)]
*  terror wars pale in comparison. And I think that's just, I think that's undeniable. Yeah. And one of [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3046.76s)]
*  the points that a lot of the hawks would make when they were supporting the U S backing Ukraine all [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3052.04s)]
*  the way. And this is, this was one true point that they would make, which I would, I've conceded this [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3059.08s)]
*  in a few different debates that I've done on the topic, but they would say that cause like there [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3064.2s)]
*  were these dynamics in Ukraine pre Putin's invasion where, you know, you had people to the East of [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3068.7599999999998s)]
*  that country who were much higher percentage ethnic Russians and much higher percentage had favorable [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3076.52s)]
*  views toward, toward Russia. Whereas the people in the West of the country were, were more ethically [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3081.88s)]
*  Ukrainian and were more favorable toward like a Europe European being kind of more, more, let's [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3086.76s)]
*  just say more incorporation with Europe, broadly speaking. And they said that after Vladimir Putin [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3096.28s)]
*  launched the war, this dynamic has changed a lot. And that actually now the percentage of the country [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3103.0s)]
*  who are against Putin is, is higher than it was before. And this is true. People don't tend to [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3108.12s)]
*  like to be invaded, even if they were kind of sympathetic to you before that you come in there, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3112.6s)]
*  you start dropping bombs, people start dying and they start to develop a hatred for you. And it's [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3116.92s)]
*  just interesting that people will say, cause I hear this with Iran where they go, look, the people [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3121.56s)]
*  really hate their government. And you're like, listen, I am sure that is true. There's lots of [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3125.72s)]
*  people in this country who hate their government. There's lots of people in just about every country [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3130.52s)]
*  who hate their government. And I'm sure that's, that is true in the case of Iran, but that was [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3133.64s)]
*  also true in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. In fact, the overwhelming majority of the country were Shiites. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3138.92s)]
*  They were not, they didn't love Saddam Hussein, but the point is you're going to go in there, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3144.68s)]
*  you're going to start dropping bombs on people. You're going to start killing people. And the [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3148.68s)]
*  fact that they didn't like their previous government doesn't mean that Thomas Jefferson's [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3152.12s)]
*  going to rise to power. You know, it might mean as it did in Iraq, that there's going to be an [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3155.96s)]
*  eight year civil war where a million people are going to die. And so the idea that these hawks, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3160.44s)]
*  that just people after witnessing all of these catastrophes could look at this and still think [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3165.4s)]
*  that like, just because there's like, there's some pictures in the seventies of women wearing [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3170.84s)]
*  mini skirts in Tehran, or just because there's some people who don't very much like their own [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3177.88s)]
*  repressive government that therefore, and this is part of the reason why it was so powerful, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3182.28s)]
*  even more so than the population question, although that one's very important too. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3186.52s)]
*  When Tucker asked Ted Cruz about the ethnic mix of the country, and he just has no clue. You're [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3190.04s)]
*  like, so you don't even know who would potentially be fighting here for power in a civil war. You [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3194.44s)]
*  don't even know like what the ethnic tendrons or tribal hatreds are in this country. And then, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3198.84s)]
*  you know, to the point that you had mentioned earlier that, you know, again, if, if we're just [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3203.64s)]
*  gaming out all these possibilities here, you know, if you have a refugee crisis as you did in Iraq [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3210.6s)]
*  and in Syria and in Libya, if you have a refugee crisis like that, well, this is a country of 90 [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3215.56s)]
*  million people. So you're looking at the potential of having a much bigger, much more destabilizing [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3220.2799999999997s)]
*  migrant crisis, which all the right-wingers in Europe have essentially risen in prominence [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3226.2799999999997s)]
*  against opposing the, you know, the mass migration into Europe. Well, it was all caused by [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3233.16s)]
*  destabilizing this region. And now we're flirting again for no reason with the biggest one yet. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3238.04s)]
*  No, absolutely. I don't remember who I heard the other day that was talking about that the [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3244.52s)]
*  Kurds would rise and take over Iran, which is about the most insane thing you can imagine. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3248.04s)]
*  Yeah, like Turkey, the neighbor to the West is going to allow the Kurds to take over Iran. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3253.3199999999997s)]
*  It would create this Kurdish belt that stretches all across the Middle East. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3258.2s)]
*  Look, would I be okay with that? That's not my business. I don't know. The Kurds were great [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3261.48s)]
*  warriors with us in Iraq, but that's, that's not really logical for them to rise up. Dave, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3265.24s)]
*  you talk about Iran going into a civil war if we invade because there are some unknown leader may [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3271.08s)]
*  try to rise. There would be a vacuum. There would be a conflict for power. And you say that because [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3278.12s)]
*  of experience, but it's not like you've actually been there. It's not like you actually have [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3283.7999999999997s)]
*  experienced that type of thing. And so your opinion to some people, especially the Warhawks, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3289.4s)]
*  is unfounded and unjust. But to me, I find it completely compelling. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3295.0s)]
*  Our history, our experience, our pattern is a direct evidence of what would happen again. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3299.08s)]
*  If we do the same thing, because you know, when you do the same thing over and over and again, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3305.0s)]
*  you're going to get the same damn results. And if we destabilize another country, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3308.36s)]
*  another regime change war, and we do it on the back of our CIA and our military and our proxies [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3312.76s)]
*  fighting, we're going to get the exact same result. There will be a conflict and the strongest bad [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3318.04s)]
*  guy will rise to power because that's what happens when you destabilize a country. The strongest bad [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3323.16s)]
*  guy rises always. Dan, I think, I think you are doing the most important work in the country. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3328.12s)]
*  And I, I couldn't imagine having a better damn messenger doing it than you. So thank you for [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3336.12s)]
*  what you're doing. Thank you for taking the time. Let everybody know where they can go to support [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3342.2s)]

*  protests the proper way with the proper authority, because that will help keep them home from these [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3365.64s)]
*  endless wars as well. And when it comes time, if you've got five minutes on your lunch break [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3369.72s)]
*  once a week, go to defend the guard dot us forward slash phone bank and sign up and Diego, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3373.96s)]

*  our communications director who is we call him our autistic typewriter. He is brilliant [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3383.08s)]

*  want to talk about. We are laser focused on our mission and hunters. The reason for that [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3392.04s)]
*  our organization is lean. That's it. That's it. I've got three other consultants and the three of [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnUEeWPtVI&t=3396.6s)]
