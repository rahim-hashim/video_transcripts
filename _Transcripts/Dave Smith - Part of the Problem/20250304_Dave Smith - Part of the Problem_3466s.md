**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc)
*  All right. What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. Very excited for today's episode. Okay. A couple of quick things. Let [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  me get them out of the way and then we'll get right into it. Number one, tomorrow I'm [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=15.88s)]
*  headed up to Buffalo, New York. I'll be there with Robbie the Fire Bernstein or no, I'm [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=20.36s)]
*  going to be there. All right. Friday and Saturday, no, Thursday and Friday in Buffalo and then [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=25.92s)]
*  Saturday night in St. Catharines. Two shows up there. The first one is already sold out. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=29.92s)]
*  The second one is going to sell out. If you want to come grab tickets now, comicdavesmith.com [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  and then the other, and you get all the ticket links for my calendar for the rest of the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=39.0s)]
*  year there. And the other thing is of course, remember I am returning to the SoHo Forum [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=43.32000000000001s)]
*  in May debating Alex Norweshtes, I still don't know how to say his last name, from the Cato [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=47.72s)]
*  Institute. We'll be debating immigration. Tickets for that are moving quickly. So if [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=54.84s)]
*  you are in the New York City area and you want to come out, go to thesohoforum.org to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=58.84s)]
*  get tickets there. And also if you're in the New York City area, go check out one of Gene [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=64.04s)]
*  Epstein's debate series there. It's sohoforum.org is a great, great organization, great debate [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=68.2s)]
*  series. Gene Epstein is one of our best guys and I always enjoy everything he does. Okay. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=73.76s)]
*  Got back on today's show, the legend Scott Horton, Antiwar.com, the Libertarian Institute, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=80.8s)]
*  and of course the author of this phenomenal book, Provoked, which is really the, it's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=87.36s)]
*  really the book you need to read to understand the buildup to the current catastrophe in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=95.76s)]
*  Ukraine. And really a whole history of US-Russia post-Soviet relations. And it's really a wild [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  story and it's, I'm sure it's kind of been cool for you, Scott, that, you know, so, okay, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=110.2s)]
*  so you wrote this phenomenal book years ago called Fool's errand and it was about the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  war in Afghanistan. And then you wrote Enough, Enough Already, which was about the, all of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  the terror wars. But it did feel like those books, it was a recent history. I mean, okay, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=127.44s)]
*  Afghanistan, I think was still going on as you wrote the book, but it was, it had totally [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=133.84s)]
*  been accepted that like, yes, this war was a disaster. It was kind of, everyone had agreed, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=138.12s)]
*  you know, the same with the terror wars too. This thing is like, your book is coming out, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=143.6s)]
*  you're still in the middle of your book tour and it's become like the biggest issue that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=150.44s)]
*  everybody's talking about. So that right away has got to be kind of interesting from your [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=156.24s)]
*  perspective. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=159.76s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm getting almost universally good feedback from it. I've had very little substantive [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=161.0s)]
*  criticism, a lot of Russian asset and Russian talking point type garbage. But on a substantive [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=169.12s)]
*  basis, they seem to have not read the thing because they'll accuse me of never addressing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=177.48s)]
*  stuff that has a whole section of its own and whatever in there, you know, I don't know. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=181.88s)]
*  So, but look, it's, it did get up to the top 300 on all of Amazon. It's now still in the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=186.4s)]
*  top 1000. It's, I believe in the top 700 something or 600, no, I think 700 something on Amazon [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=193.36s)]
*  and still number one in war and peace and still in the top, top 40 in all history on [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=201.08s)]
*  Amazon. So, and that's three and a half months. And if it wasn't for Jimmy Carter dying and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=209.84s)]
*  Dave Chappelle recommending his book, Peace, Not Apartheid on Saturday Night Live, then I'd have been [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  number one in war and peace the whole time. But Jimmy Carter kind of he snaked my title for a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=220.92s)]
*  minute there, but I got it back. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=225.92s)]
*  That's good people reading that book. It's not a bad book for people to read. I've never read it, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=228.12s)]
*  but I'm familiar with the the thesis of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=232.56s)]
*  what he got in for writing it. So [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=235.72s)]
*  must have. Right, exactly. Okay, so let's, let's jump right into this. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  This the latest, because this really is. And it's, you know, we've been living through such a crazy [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  few years in this country. And I, as someone who does a show, I talk about this a lot. But when you [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  do a show about the news, it's almost like there's something crazy every single day to talk about. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=260.88s)]
*  And there's always like a new thing. And it's it's sometimes it's a challenge to kind of like zoom [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=267.04s)]
*  out and see things from, you know, like a transcendent position and the 10,000 feet above [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=272.8s)]
*  looking down this, this meeting with Zelinsky and Trump in the Oval Office was one of those things [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  where it's like, this is this was really truly remarkable. I've never seen anything quite like it in my life. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's just, I was, I want to get your thoughts on it. And then we could get into the kind of what's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=293.52s)]
*  come after. But I, you know, I, my first thought on it was just that this was, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=300.96s)]
*  it's got to be like the greatest political strategic blunder I've ever seen. And I don't, you know, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=310.32s)]
*  I've read a lot about this conflict. I don't necessarily have like a good understanding of who [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  Zelinsky is. But I don't know, like what your thoughts are, like who was in his ear? Why did he think [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=324.24s)]
*  this would be a good move? And what when you're in a position where you're totally dependent on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump, the idea that you would come in and try to like out alpha him on live television and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=336.56s)]
*  in a language that you don't really speak and to think that was going to go well for you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=344.24s)]
*  I mean, like, what were you thinking when you first saw it? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=349.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, yeah, I was a bit just in disbelief. In fact, the second time I watched it, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=353.44s)]
*  I finally found the clip of the whole deal, the 40 minute long discussion leading up to it and everything. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=359.2s)]
*  And, you know, I was impressed the first time, but the second time I watched, I was like, wow, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=365.92s)]
*  I really had not remembered just how bad it was the him attempting to shout down Trump and talk [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=371.6s)]
*  over Trump in that way. That's pretty remarkable. I think, well, we got two choices, right? One is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  he just couldn't stand anymore and he had to blurt something stupid out. And he's like kicking [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=386.32000000000005s)]
*  himself now, which I think is the less likely explanation or that this was, you know, a planned [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=390.8s)]
*  political move that he made because essentially what was happening was Trump was saying, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=398.08s)]
*  we're going to call this ceasefire. That's what we're going to do. We're going to, we want to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=403.44s)]
*  deal where the fighting stops implying, of course, then that everyone accepts that the lines are [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=407.28s)]
*  where they're drawn now. Right. And potentially, maybe in negotiations, they would even grow. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=413.76s)]
*  Right. Because as it stands now, Russia still doesn't control 100% of Donetsk nor [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=421.44s)]
*  of Zaprochka or Kursk, although they do control, I believe, virtually all of Luhansk [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=427.52s)]
*  and some of our Kiev. But so this is Zelensky, I think had already decided that Trump was throwing [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=435.28s)]
*  him overboard and wasn't going to keep supporting him in more anyway. And that, I don't know what [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  the deal the minerals is, is hardly worth anything. And we can talk a little bit more about that. But [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  that's basically a red herring for the most part. But so I think his decision was that instead of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=455.92s)]
*  cutting, running from the war, he just wanted to cut and run from the United States and say, fine, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=468.16s)]
*  because of course, if America stops backing him, we can't really make a deal with Russia to end [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=474.0s)]
*  the war. If Ukraine's not willing to end the war and we can call off all support and then they will [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=479.92s)]
*  be in a much tougher situation. But it won't just be like the Taliban walking right into Kabul or [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  anything like that. The Russians will still have a fight on their hands, at least for a time. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=491.68s)]
*  And so Zelensky apparently is betting then that he can just turn to the Europeans and essentially [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=496.56s)]
*  bet on their center left, last status quo position, the common call it whatever you want, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=503.28s)]
*  the woke standard of the Biden administration. And that they will distance themselves from Trump, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=512.56s)]
*  who is, oh, he's the rogue and the right wing nationalist. And so they are left, they're calling [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=520.0s)]
*  him, you know, Keir Starmer, is that how you pronounce it? They're calling him the leader of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=527.2s)]
*  the free world now, because Donald Trump is the isolationist turning his back on Europe and all [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=533.2800000000001s)]
*  this, which is, you know, vast hyperbole on both counts. But you do have, it's kind of funny to see, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=538.48s)]
*  right? The British, the French and the Germans are talking about, well, and I think the polls as [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=545.44s)]
*  well, we're not going to sell you out. We're going to continue to back you no matter what, Ukraine. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=550.88s)]
*  And with the British prime minister even promising with boots and planes, he said, and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=556.16s)]
*  I would be worried about that. It's a bit, I just don't believe him. I think the Europeans have [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  already all admitted that without the United States to guarantee their guarantees, they have nothing [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=568.56s)]
*  to offer really. The British can't fight a war on the continent. And I don't think the Germans [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=575.52s)]
*  really are coming and willing to risk that level of war over Eastern Ukraine and without support [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=582.24s)]
*  from the United States and knowing that they don't have it. So, you know, I agree with you that it [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=588.96s)]
*  was ultimately a strategic blunder. I think it was deliberate, but I think it was a huge mistake, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=595.84s)]
*  because just like the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=602.64s)]
*  and the then current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, had said back in September [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=611.04s)]
*  of, or October of 2002, I guess even still in September, they said, this is as good as it's [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=616.7199999999999s)]
*  going to get for you. Quit now while you're only this far behind. It's time to come to the table [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=623.04s)]
*  and negotiate. And, you know, we already knew what happened, but there's a profile of Antony Blinken, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=628.8s)]
*  the outgoing secretary of state here in the New York Times, where they call him secretary of war. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  And they talk about how, of course, it was he and the State Department, Weenies, that won over Biden [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=639.92s)]
*  and won the argument in the government that no, we need to extend the war. And remember then, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=644.8s)]
*  they were going to launch the winter offensive, which became the spring offensive, which finally, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  when they launched, it was the summer offensive and got nowhere and just got a whole bunch of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  people killed for nothing. And this was the big gamble that Blinken had made to continue the war [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=658.4s)]
*  when the four stars were saying it's all downhill from here. So you got a good, and they did, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=663.2800000000001s)]
*  by the way, you know, the occasion at the time, Dave, was that on the weekend of September 11, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=670.48s)]
*  Ukrainians had done this great faint and had made major gains in Harkiv province and, or, you know, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=676.08s)]
*  Oblast and also down in Khursan, where they had essentially forced the Russians back to the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=682.48s)]
*  southern and eastern side of the river there. And so that was, you know, to their credit, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=689.36s)]
*  but then that was all they were going to get. And all the, you know, the actual reasonable [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  pundits on this knew it at the time, too. Everybody wise, who you would turn to for any opinion on [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=702.96s)]
*  this kind of thing at all that you could find, all said the same thing, which was even Mark Milley [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=708.96s)]
*  is saying quit now, which that should have been all you need to know. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=714.16s)]
*  Yeah, really. I mean, it's wild to think about. And I guess this is just, I'm like, I don't know, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=719.92s)]
*  I guess I'm old enough now that I've lived through like nine wars or, you know, whatever it's been. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  And it is amazing how they just all follow this pattern where it's like, okay, you, first of all, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=735.36s)]
*  everybody hyperventilates about this imagined worst case scenario. There never really seems [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=742.56s)]
*  to be an onus on you to demonstrate that it's a likelihood or anything like that. But, you know, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=749.1199999999999s)]
*  whatever Saddam Hussein is about to give the weapons he doesn't have off to the terrorists [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=754.2399999999999s)]
*  that he's not friends with. And then Kansas gets nuked. And, you know, with this war, it's been [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  constantly, you know, Vladimir Putin is going to reconstitute the Soviet Union. He's going to move [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=762.4s)]
*  on Poland. He's going to do all these things. Then there's just lie after lie after lie, you know, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=766.0s)]
*  from in this war, there was, I mean, the ghosts of Kiev and, you know, Vladimir Putin blew up the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=772.4s)]
*  Nord Stream pipeline and just all these things that serious people in suits and ties say into [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  cameras that are just all completely wrong. Yeah, time is on Ukraine side. That was the big point. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=783.6s)]
*  Ukraine is winning. Ukraine is winning was constantly being said and then throughout the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=789.12s)]
*  whole thing that Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and blink it all in this said that even Crimea [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=793.9200000000001s)]
*  has to be retaken by the Ukrainians as if that was like it's even a kind of achievable goal. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=801.68s)]
*  And then as the dust starts to settle, you start to look back at the thing. You know, I don't know, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=807.76s)]
*  I've seen different estimates of the numbers of dead, but it seems to be the consensus that it's [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=814.4s)]
*  in the high hundreds of thousands at this point, at least, well, I guess we'll find out more over [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=819.5999999999999s)]
*  the years. And then you look back and you think about Stronten, Strontenberg, I always butcher [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=826.24s)]
*  that name, but the head of NATO said himself that in late 21, Vladimir Putin actually sent a draft [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=831.76s)]
*  to NATO to just be like, listen, here is the deal. I will not invade if you just put in writing [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=842.08s)]
*  that you won't bring Ukraine into NATO. And to think about that, that that like how much better [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=848.48s)]
*  that deal would have been for Zelensky than what he's like. NATO is already off the table. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  He's not they're not getting in NATO anyway. And to think that literally they could have kept [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=861.84s)]
*  everything except Crimea, but they weren't getting Crimea back at that point. But whatever they [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=866.08s)]
*  could would have lost. Crimea kept the integrity of the rest of Ukraine just agreed to not join [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  NATO. And all these people, I mean, the country wouldn't have had to be destroyed. All these [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=875.28s)]
*  conscripted troops on both sides wouldn't have had to die. It's just it really is like maddening [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=879.36s)]
*  when you when you look at it in totality. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=884.48s)]
*  sponsor for today's show, which is Tax Network USA. If you owe back taxes or your tax returns [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=888.48s)]
*  are still unfiled, maybe you missed the deadline to file for an extension. The IRS may be ramping [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=895.28s)]
*  up enforcement. You could face wage garnishment, frozen bank accounts, even property seizures if [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=900.96s)]
*  you haven't taken action yet. But there's still hope. Tax Network USA has helped the taxpayers [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=906.24s)]
*  save over a billion dollars in tax debt and has filed over 10,000 tax returns. They specialize [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=911.36s)]
*  in helping people like you reduce their tax burdens and they can help you too. Don't wait any longer. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=917.6800000000001s)]

*  consultation. Their experts will walk you through a few simple questions to see how much you can [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=932.1600000000001s)]
*  save. Act now before the IRS takes more aggressive steps. Take control today. Visit tnusa.com Smith [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=936.96s)]
*  or call them at 1-800-958-1000. All right, let's get back into the show. Yeah, well, and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=944.8000000000001s)]
*  then I mean, the medium term future here at minimum just completely sucks for everybody as well, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=951.68s)]
*  because, you know, no matter exactly how the war finally comes to an end, Russia's not losing that [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=958.8s)]
*  territory. They have essentially, you know, absorbed the most pro-Russian population of Ukraine [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=965.8399999999999s)]
*  into Russia just by expanding the line around them. And but what that means is they've moved [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=973.04s)]
*  them out of Ukraine. And so now nobody in Ukraine is pro-Russia anymore. Or, you know, the ones who, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=978.56s)]
*  who, you know, are even sympathetic at all are going to be far more marginal in Russian politics [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=985.8399999999999s)]
*  now, which is going to be even more heavily dominated by the, you know, nationalist from far [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=991.1999999999999s)]
*  out west who absolutely hate Russia. And I don't know if they're going to be allowed. I don't think [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=997.1999999999999s)]
*  they ever will be allowed to join NATO, but they may still join the EU and they still will be, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1003.76s)]
*  you know, anti-matter force stuck right there sharing a border with matter in the form of Russia [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1010.0s)]
*  from now on. And so I expect there to continue to be problems, you know, kind of ongoing even after [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1017.2s)]
*  the Civil War or the major war comes to an end and including what could be a Nazi based insurgency [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  led by the likes of Andrew Bolesky and Dmitry Yarozh and these others who, you know, it is after [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1032.24s)]
*  all a massive country and the Russians still only control like the Eastern and Southern [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1037.52s)]
*  fifth of it, right? I mean, it's the size of Texas, which there's a reason the size of Texas is a [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  cliche. It's because it's huge. Same as Afghanistan. So now a lot of it is barren step and not very [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1049.04s)]
*  conducive to insurgency, but they do have some forests and some swampland and some other places [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1057.52s)]
*  where they could be based out of. And so there, I'm sure there are those who would want to continue [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1063.12s)]
*  to fight over the long-term. I don't know whether the national, you know, central state would be [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1069.28s)]
*  able to stop them or not. I think, I don't know that this is what Zelensky is thinking, but he [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1073.84s)]
*  has reason to fear that these guys don't kill him if he makes peace. They've said that they would [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1080.0s)]
*  over and over again. Even before the war, when he first took power in 2019, they threatened to kill [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1084.64s)]
*  him over all the guys who died in the war so far. So you want to talk about, you know, the sunk cost [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1089.8400000000001s)]
*  fallacy after all that they have sacrificed. He's going to sell them out now. Like he has reason to [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1095.5200000000002s)]
*  flee home to the Brookings institution after that, man, they could have his ass. So [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1102.96s)]
*  that may be part of his calculation here is there are some in Ukraine and it's, I think, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1108.72s)]
*  far from the majority, but there are some who would rather never give in and keep fighting to the death [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1114.32s)]
*  no matter what. And so that may be part of his calculation, maybe not, but I think, well, I'd be [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1119.36s)]
*  very interested to see after, especially yesterday where he said the war is going to continue for a [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1126.56s)]
*  very long time. And then Trump denounced him for talking like that even and all this, the break is [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1130.88s)]
*  getting solidified and things can change quickly. There's so much at stake that people can say sorry [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1137.2800000000002s)]
*  and shake hands and do different things and maybe try to get back on the same page. But, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1142.64s)]
*  you know, as we're recording this, essentially his stance is we're going to keep fighting without you [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1148.5600000000002s)]
*  and you can't make peace without us. And so who holds the cards now? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1152.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, I guess we will see what happens. I mean, I got to say I was really blown away [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1158.16s)]
*  by the level of disrespect that Zelensky showed Trump and Vance. And I was talking about this [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1166.48s)]
*  today on the, I was recording with Tom earlier today. And I think I mentioned this on the last [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1175.2s)]
*  podcast as well, but there is like, look, I'm not, you know, I'm not like a conservative, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1181.68s)]
*  you know, I'm a right-wing liberal like Murray Rothbard or something like that, but I'm not like [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1188.48s)]
*  a conservative. There are things that, do you remember, like, I remember Pat Buchanan, who I [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1194.16s)]
*  have tremendous respect for, but I remember, do you remember, there was something where Obama, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1200.72s)]
*  I think he took a picture in the Oval Office with like his suit jacket off and he just had like a [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1204.96s)]
*  shirt and tie. And I remember Pat Buchanan being furious about this. It was like, it's disrespectful [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1210.8000000000002s)]
*  to the Oval Office or something like that. You know, like I'm not that, you know, I don't really [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1215.52s)]
*  care. I'm not a suit and tie guy. I never wear a suit and tie, almost, almost never. But I gotta say, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1219.44s)]
*  it was very strange to me that he comes dressed like that. Like you don't put on a suit and tie [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1228.16s)]
*  when, and you know, Trump cares about that. That's the type of thing Trump really cares about, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1232.0800000000002s)]
*  like looking TV ready or whatever. But I was, I was blown away that he referred to the vice president [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1236.16s)]
*  as JD. Like that to me was like, you know, when Rogan floated out the idea of having the pod [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1243.2s)]
*  cast with me and Trump and Joe Rogan, which I, you know, probably won't happen, but would be cool [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1249.28s)]
*  if it ever did. But like in that, like I would refer to him as Mr. President. I would never, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1253.52s)]
*  I would never sit there and say that Donald, the thing is that, you know what I mean? Like that [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1259.6s)]
*  just seems crazy to me. That could have been a translation mistake type of a thing too. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1263.6s)]
*  Possible. Yeah. So don't fight with the president and vice president when you don't speak the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1269.2s)]
*  language properly, right? As you already said, they're like, are you sure you're fluent enough [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1273.6s)]
*  to get in this crap right now in this situation? And so that was a huge error to do, right? To say, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1277.44s)]
*  look JD, and, but then importantly, what was the statement? He was disregarding what he said. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1283.04s)]
*  Like, listen, you're talking about negotiating with Putin, but you can't negotiate with Putin. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1288.0800000000002s)]
*  You're essentially a fool to say that you can negotiate with this guy. He must be made to lose [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1293.28s)]
*  the war first, and then you have to give me a war guarantee. And so that was when Vance said, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1298.64s)]
*  not, Hey, how dare you call me JD, but I can't believe he actually said, like actually astonished. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1304.0s)]
*  Wow. I can't believe you want to litigate this right here in public with us because guess what? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1311.04s)]
*  You're going to lose the argument now. You might've had a chance backstage. I think was the [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1316.72s)]
*  implication there, but dude, you're going to come at me like this. And, but the thing is too, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1322.3200000000002s)]
*  they should have already agreed. You know, everybody talks about the deal, the deal, the deal. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1329.04s)]
*  Well, which deal? You're talking about a ceasefire and Russia stays where they are, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1332.24s)]
*  or you're just talking about this mineral deal. And then who knows what's going to happen in [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1336.8s)]
*  peace negotiations later, et cetera, et cetera. Right. Most of the actual minerals are not rare [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1340.08s)]
*  earth minerals, but there are other minerals in the country, but they're all under Russian control [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1345.76s)]
*  in the Donbass. So now I think there, there must be some east of the river there, but mostly it's [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1350.16s)]
*  wheat fields. And those have already been gangsterized by Carr Gill and Archie Daniels, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1357.2s)]
*  Midland and Monsanto company back in the Obama years. So I don't know if they're still there [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1361.28s)]
*  now. There might be biding their time until the war ends to go back in and, and monopolize all [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1365.84s)]
*  that grain, but, or try-opalize it, I guess. But it used to be illegal for foreign multinational [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1373.52s)]
*  corporations to come in and buy up all that Ukrainian grain, but America just overthrows [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1380.96s)]
*  the government when the wrong guys win over there. So they changed the law to make it okay. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1386.6399999999999s)]
*  So that's a huge part of, you know, I don't know exactly their role in lobbying for the war, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1391.6s)]
*  but it's a huge part of American based multinational corporations interests in Ukraine [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1396.3999999999999s)]
*  is all that grain, not just the potential natural gas resources and coal and iron and [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1401.12s)]
*  whatever in the east. So it seems to me that coming out of, of this, you know, this altercation in the [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1407.28s)]
*  Oval Office. Well, I mean, look at the big Donald Trump did announce he's halting all weapon sales [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1418.32s)]
*  to Ukraine. It does seem like an, and why don't we, you kind of alluded to, maybe we could talk [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1425.36s)]
*  about this. Yeah, well, that's, I mean, it really is something. I mean, it is, there's nothing, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1430.8s)]
*  there's nothing more dangerous you can do in DC than end a war. I mean, that is a grave crime [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1438.56s)]
*  to them. So this, that really is high crimes and misdemeanors. I mean, that's the worst crime you [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1443.68s)]
*  can commit is ending a war. So he might have to get impeached. And they really mean it. I mean, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1448.48s)]
*  even when I say this, I know it sounds silly. Like if somebody was too young or not paying attention [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1453.6000000000001s)]
*  at the time, or just on vacation or something, if I tell you, I know it sounds nuts to say, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1458.96s)]
*  but it's really true. The third time ever that the Congress impeached the president of the United [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1464.08s)]
*  States of America, it was Donald Trump for temporarily holding up an arms shipment to Ukraine, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1469.52s)]
*  which Ukrainians all agreed they didn't even notice was late. What, what late shipment? I don't even [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1475.36s)]
*  know what you're talking about. We didn't, we weren't even do another crate for another six weeks [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1480.72s)]
*  or whatever it was. Nothing happened at all in the name of an extortion that did not take place. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  The whole thing was completely phony. It's unbelievable. Well, they'd all, they all called [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1490.72s)]
*  it a quid pro quo, but it wasn't, there was nothing. It was in a, in a tempted quid pro quo [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1495.44s)]
*  that wasn't even clearly like even, yeah. Well, it's because the truth is that for Donald Trump, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1502.56s)]
*  like if Donald Trump had asked them to, um, manipulate evidence or had asked them to frame [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1511.6000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden, then you'd have a real, you know, like you'd have something there. You'd have like a case [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1519.04s)]
*  on your hands, but to ask them to investigate behavior that is questionably criminal is just [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1524.16s)]
*  like, then he never got the investigation and they got the weapons. I mean, that was, I remember [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1532.0s)]
*  arguing about this at the time I go, here's where your case really falls apart. Okay. None of this [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1536.3200000000002s)]
*  ever happened. And so like, what are you really arguing? It's the biggest asterisk in the whole [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1540.72s)]
*  world too, which is that the FBI had Hunter Biden's laptop for three months leading up to the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1545.92s)]
*  impeachment, which was in January of 20. And so on that laptop, anyone can now read emails back [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1553.12s)]
*  and forth between Hunter Biden and the leaders of Burisma promising them that he's going to intervene [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1561.6s)]
*  in American politics to protect them for prosecution. It's all right there. And then what do they do? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1567.4399999999998s)]
*  Not only did they not leak that this is the FBI, the land of 10,000 leaks against Donald Trump, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1573.1999999999998s)]
*  they get the biggest leak in the world that would spare him in the middle of being impeached. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1578.48s)]
*  And they keep that all buried under wraps and behind a grand jury and whatever it is. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1584.0s)]
*  And then what do they do with it in the, in the months in the lead up to the election, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1588.24s)]
*  when they know that Giuliani also has the laptop and this is going to be the Republicans big October [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1593.04s)]
*  surprise. They go to all the social media companies and the major media companies and tell them, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1597.68s)]
*  Beware of incoming Russian disinformation, accusing Hunter Biden of doing something wrong with this [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1602.88s)]
*  gas company Burisma. And so then when it comes out, they're able to censor the entire thing. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1608.72s)]
*  You're talking about rigging the election and it was the FBI and the CIA that did it. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1613.68s)]
*  His own government did it to him. It's unbelievable. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1618.24s)]
*  And literally, I mean, this is like, I mean, you have every piece of evidence, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1622.32s)]
*  because it sounds crazy to say this, but this is really what they did. And that even when [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1627.2s)]
*  Rogan asked Zuckerberg about the Hunter Biden story, his first response was, well, the FBI came [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1631.76s)]
*  and told us that this big Russian dump was coming. And so that was obviously that, and then they came [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1639.52s)]
*  out and said, that was the Russian disinformation, right? When they signed that famous or infamous [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1644.72s)]
*  letter. And we know that the New York Times, Scott Shane was at the tabletop exercise where they [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1649.52s)]
*  warned him about all of this. And then when all the censorship regime came out with the laptop, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1655.44s)]
*  he didn't say nothing about it. Same for Noah Shockman at Rolling Stone, who is otherwise [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1659.44s)]
*  most famous for being, for helping to cover up the most disgusting, unspeakable crimes of his [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1664.48s)]
*  buddy, James Gordon Meek from ABC News. Yeah. So it seems to me, let's get in a little bit to, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1671.44s)]
*  like, this, I mean, you touched a little bit on the mineral stuff and the mineral deal, but I think [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1680.8s)]
*  it seems to me that possibly the best thing to come out of this fiasco in the Oval Office is that [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1685.92s)]
*  maybe Donald Trump does just walk away from this silly idea. And, you know, there is, you know, as [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1694.5600000000002s)]
*  you know, me and you have talked about this a lot over the years. And I will, like, you know, I'll [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1700.48s)]
*  kind of preface this by saying that I am, I'm quite happy with some of the things coming out [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1706.24s)]
*  of this administration. I mean, it's been a mixed bag. There's been some really positives and there's [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1713.68s)]
*  been some negatives. But that already, from our perspective, is like, oh my God, we never get [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1718.0s)]
*  positives. Like, this is amazing. At least something's happening. I love that the, even just [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1723.6000000000001s)]
*  the way that Elon Musk and Donald Trump have kind of mainstreamed the idea of how corrupt and wasteful [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1730.24s)]
*  the government is with our money is great. And this stuff on Ukraine really has been the best part, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1737.68s)]
*  probably, of all of it. The problem with Donald Trump seems to be that, now I know I'm repeating [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1742.8s)]
*  myself from the last show, but I want to get your thoughts on this. But it's like everything good [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1751.04s)]
*  about Donald Trump is always instinctual. It's always like his gut tells him, you know, this [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1756.56s)]
*  doesn't make sense. 20 years of war and we're spending eight trillion dollars and what do we [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1763.04s)]
*  have to show for? That's bad business, you know? But none of it ever comes from like a philosophical [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1767.04s)]
*  grounding or a deep knowledge of the story, of the history. And so he's very susceptible to getting [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1771.84s)]
*  distracted by shiny objects. You know, it's very like, ah, this war is bad business. It doesn't [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1779.04s)]
*  make any sense. And someone would be like, we could take the oil. He goes, well, now we're talking [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1784.0s)]
*  business. You know, and like you could get this. And it does seem to me that he constantly was, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1787.28s)]
*  he was going back and forth for the whole campaign for 24. He would go back and forth between saying, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1792.48s)]
*  like, perfect stuff and then saying, like, Europe should pay more, you know, like as if like, oh, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1800.64s)]
*  okay, it would be okay to keep the war going as long as Europe was paying more. But then sometimes [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1807.2800000000002s)]
*  he'd say like the right. And it does seem to me that he was at least the way he was presenting it [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1811.8400000000001s)]
*  publicly was that he was selling this to Zelensky as like, look, this is kind of the best security [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1816.4s)]
*  guarantee that you can get from us. Like if we're in business together, then if Putin comes and [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1823.2s)]
*  messes with you, he's kind of messing with us too. But it just, it can't be stated enough that [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1827.36s)]
*  that's the whole point is that we don't want to do that. And that's what this whole war started over [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1832.56s)]
*  to begin with. And, and, you know, I know it's like, it's easy to get, look like you're, you wrote a [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1838.32s)]
*  very big book on this subject. There's a lot of very interesting, like details in there. And I know [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1844.08s)]
*  people argue about all of this stuff and that, but it's almost like to zoom out and just look at how [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1849.76s)]
*  insane this policy is that even, even when the Soviet Union existed, when there actually was the [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1854.56s)]
*  Soviet Union, we, we only gave the security guarantees to Western Europe, not even the [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1861.9199999999998s)]
*  Eastern part, part of Germany had a security guarantee. And now we're like, what are we talking [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1867.2s)]
*  about a security guarantee for Luhansk? Like what is going on that we would think that like it's just [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1872.32s)]
*  such madness. And to even, it's like, I, Donald Trump, while he's correct in wanting to end the thing, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1878.0s)]
*  he just doesn't even get that part of it. That the whole lesson here should be like, no, the last [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1884.72s)]
*  thing we want. I mean, it was, to me, it was appalling to have Zelensky demanding security [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1890.08s)]
*  guarantees from us. Like what, you're entitled to us. I mean, what is the security guarantee? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1895.68s)]
*  You're saying we have to be ready to fight a war on behalf of your country. Sorry, like screw you. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1901.36s)]
*  No, we don't. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1907.44s)]
*  Monetary Metals. I love this company. They are truly revolutionizing the precious metal space [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1912.64s)]
*  and just great people who run the company as well. As many of you know, gold prices have been breaking [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1918.88s)]
*  all time highs in 2024, but now because of Monetary Metals, you can get your gold to work for you, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1924.24s)]
*  generating interest income every month, paid in additional ounces of physical gold. You can earn [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1931.8400000000001s)]
*  up to 5% on your gold and silver in their lease offerings and accredited investors can even earn [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1938.48s)]
*  double digit returns in their bond offerings. Again, all the interest is paid in ounces, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1943.92s)]
*  which are stored for free on your behalf. So if you're tired of your gold and silver collecting [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1949.28s)]
*  dust at home or worse, racking up fees, having your metal professionally stored, check out [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1954.16s)]
*  monetary-metals.com to learn how you can start putting your metal to work today. That's [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1959.2s)]
*  monetary-metals.com. All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1965.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Kyle Anzlone has a great show on YouTube and he had clips of these congressmen [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1969.76s)]
*  talking about, you know, yeah, it'll have to be like the Korean model where we'll stay forever. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1980.1599999999999s)]
*  This is how John McCain talked about Iraq 20 years ago that like, oh yeah, no, we can never [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1985.04s)]
*  come home from there. And that just makes no sense at all. If you're not willing to fight for them now, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1990.4s)]
*  you're willing to fight for them then after they've already lost, what's the point of that? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=1998.96s)]
*  The whole thing is crazy. And then having some workers there as a security guarantee, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2004.4s)]
*  some miners that essentially they'll serve as a tripwire for war that Russia would always think, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2014.24s)]
*  not just twice, but even three times about invading because American miners could get [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2020.8s)]
*  caught up in it and they don't want trouble with us. Well, if you're going to do that, then it would [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2025.2s)]
*  make more logical sense to put combat forces there who could actually be a deterrent of some kind. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2031.2s)]
*  Not that I'm recommending that, but I'm just saying it makes no sense to have, you know, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2038.3999999999999s)]
*  like we have in Korea, our soldiers are not there to really, there's not enough of them there [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2042.88s)]
*  to deter an attack or to defeat an attack from North Korea, probably, but they are a tripwire. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2049.44s)]
*  That means if North Korea ever attacks South Korea, our guys will be caught up in it. And that'll mean [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2055.92s)]
*  the rest of the USA is also coming. And so yeah, it just makes no sense whatsoever to this whole [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2060.32s)]
*  damn war, Dave, has been fought for the principle that Ukraine can too join NATO [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2067.92s)]
*  day in the long term future from now, which we're absolutely not willing to let them in now, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2073.28s)]
*  which might've been a deterrent, although I think it would've caused the war sooner, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2079.44s)]
*  but we're not willing to give them a war guarantee. But we're willing to help them [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2083.04s)]
*  get into and lose a three year war on the principle that no one else can say that they can't join. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2089.92s)]
*  And so, and you know, back to, as I say in the book over and over again, I cite all of these hawks, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2098.7200000000003s)]
*  not the opponents of NATO expansion, and which included not just our heroes like Pat Buchanan [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2104.4s)]
*  and Ron Paul, but and Ted Galen Carpenter and other of our guys, but including vast parts of [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2110.8s)]
*  the foreign policy establishment were against this. But then even the expanders like Richard [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2118.32s)]
*  Holbrook, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger and others, they all said, well, of course we have [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2123.84s)]
*  to make a special exception for Ukraine. Of course, they have to have some kind of, they all said the [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2127.68s)]
*  same thing. Like Austria or Finland during the last cold war, where they don't have troops [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2133.12s)]
*  occupying their country from either side. They're not in NATO and they're not in the Warsaw Pact, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2138.48s)]
*  and they're just neutral and will do the same kind of thing for Ukraine. Forgive me if I'm [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2143.04s)]
*  being redundant. I forgot what I said on your show last time, but there's a guy named Ken Pollack, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2147.2s)]
*  who was sort of the liberal hawk who told all the liberal Democrats it was a good idea to [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2152.0s)]
*  support W. Bush's war in 2003. He was like best buddies and writing partners with a guy named [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2156.4s)]
*  Ohanlin, Michael Ohanlin, who's maybe a little bit more prominent, but they're sort of alter [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2164.08s)]
*  egos, these guys. Anyway, so they're like, you know, Brookings Institution guys, right? Like very [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2169.44s)]
*  center left liberal Democrat war hawks. And he wrote a monograph that came out in 2018, saying, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2175.44s)]
*  we got to, you know, have a new treaty that guarantees no further NATO expansion and [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2182.88s)]
*  neutrality for Ukraine and this permanent arrangement security structure. And he had [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2188.08s)]
*  war guarantees built into it and the rest too. But still, like, it was important that he was [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2192.88s)]
*  recognizing that we have gone too far in trying to take Ukraine away from Russia. And of course, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2198.0s)]
*  they're reacting just like everybody knew that they would. And so we should call it off here before [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2203.44s)]
*  a real war breaks out before it gets so much worse than this, at that time, low level civil war [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2208.96s)]
*  under, you know, the partially implemented Minsk to deal, let's say. And so they all knew better. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2214.8s)]
*  They all knew this was the consensus was that we shouldn't do this, that it makes no sense to bring [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2224.96s)]
*  them into NATO and give them Article Five. If Russia knew that was happening, they would invade [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2231.76s)]
*  before the ceremony and the ink was dry on the page or they would immediately test the [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2237.36s)]
*  alliance by moving right in there. As Putin said back in 2014, although a little bit optimistic, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2244.32s)]
*  he said, I could be in Kiev in two weeks. In fact, he did. His guys did get almost to Kiev before [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2251.04s)]
*  what they stopped because they were in the middle of negotiating a peace deal, one that America and [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2256.6400000000003s)]
*  Britain ruined. This is after the war had already begun. The Istanbul deal, which would be the basis [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2261.36s)]
*  of the deal that they're trying to get right now. And at the time, of course, the two major issues [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2268.6400000000003s)]
*  was NATO expansion and the ongoing civil war. And they were willing to accept the Donbass, Luhansk [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2273.84s)]
*  and Donetsk both staying in Ukraine under a strong federalism type situation, but still as part of [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2280.4s)]
*  Ukraine, not completely independent and not part of the Russian Federation, if they could have got [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2288.32s)]
*  the deal. And you quoted Jens Stoltenberg earlier. You almost had it right. You just added an R. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  But Stoltenberg, you're right, he had cited that treaty that Russia proposed a treaty to NATO and [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2300.48s)]
*  the United States just signed this very simple deal and this won't happen. And they basically [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2307.36s)]
*  just ignored that. And I'm sorry, I was going to make one more point there. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2312.2400000000002s)]
*  Stoltenberg was bragging about it. And he was bragging that like, see, and now Vladimir Putin [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2317.44s)]
*  just got more NATO expansion. So ha ha, look at that. But the thing that he gave away, which is [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2323.84s)]
*  on top of him was Zelensky himself gave that statement to CNN where he said, they told me [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2330.16s)]
*  behind the scenes, look, we're not going to bring you into NATO, but in public, we're going to [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2334.88s)]
*  pretend like we're going to someday. And we want you to continue to act like that's going to happen [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2339.04s)]
*  in all this. And he explained all this in frustration on CNN, that they had him in this [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2343.76s)]
*  weird bind where they were promising that someday we'll protect you, but not now, even though we know [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2348.88s)]
*  promising to someday protect you now is going to get you into a war now. And he's saying, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2356.6400000000003s)]
*  what the hell kind of a situation is this for you to put me in? And then, but he continued to go along. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2362.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it is, you know, like as John Mearsheimer's now famous line back in 2014 was [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2367.52s)]
*  that the US is leading Ukraine down the Primrose path. And it is, I mean, it's one of the great [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2377.92s)]
*  ironies of all of this is that all of the people who like changed their flags to their Twitter bios [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2384.0s)]
*  to Ukrainian flags and all the Hawks on this, it's like, they're the worst enemies of the Ukrainian [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2392.0s)]
*  people. And it certainly seems that, so you know, another lie, or at least quasi lie that was told, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2396.88s)]
*  you know, throughout this whole thing is how much the Ukrainians just want to fight, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2405.04s)]
*  and they just want to fight and want to fight. Except like, then you start seeing the stories [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2408.7200000000003s)]
*  of how like violently conscripted this army is, I think there were over 100,000 people were charged [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2414.08s)]
*  with desertion or something like that. It's like, well, it doesn't sound like those people wanted [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2420.1600000000003s)]
*  to fight that much. I'm sure there are some others who did. But it is, you know, it's obviously [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2423.76s)]
*  the best thing for the Ukrainian people would be to end this conflict. And, you know, I guess [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2431.2000000000003s)]
*  one of the things that people will come back at us with, as you hear on like, you know, on the [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2438.88s)]
*  Piers Morgan show or something like that, when we're debating some of these guys, they'll say like, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2444.96s)]
*  well, look, you know, it's not right that Vladimir Putin gets to invade this country and then keep [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2449.84s)]
*  parts of their territory. And it's just like, you know, that can't be rewarded or something like [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2456.2400000000002s)]
*  that. But as you pointed out, which is I didn't watch the full of your episode, but I did see one [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2461.2000000000003s)]
*  of the clips on on Twitter of your latest appearance, where she would at one point ask, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2467.28s)]
*  and I'm guessing no one gave you a good answer on this. But you asked like, okay, so what's the plan [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2471.04s)]
*  here, guys? Like, what do you want to do about it? You know, the way I put it, as I've put this, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2475.6s)]
*  I've used this example, like several times, because I think there is this kind of like, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2481.68s)]
*  empire mentality that Americans are plagued with. But when you say things like that, I think to a [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2486.0s)]
*  lot of Americans that does kind of ring true, like, yeah, can't just let people do that, you know, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2491.7599999999998s)]
*  and what well if they do that, then China is going to go take Taiwan, which is the another assertion [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2496.88s)]
*  of what will happen without much evidence to like demonstrate that it's going to. But I said this on [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2502.0s)]
*  Piers Morgan the other day, and no one seemed to hit home with some of the panel. But I was like, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2508.56s)]
*  look, let's just say we decided we were going to take Mexico City. Like, for whatever reason, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2513.28s)]
*  let's just say that the American people wanted to do it. The political class wanted to do it. We had [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2517.12s)]
*  the political will. We're going to take Mexico City. What could Russia do about that? What could [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2521.84s)]
*  China do about that? Did they allow us? Isn't it just an absurd question already? Because you go [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2528.0s)]
*  as soon as you go, should China allow us? You go allow? What do you mean allow? You have no say in [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2534.24s)]
*  this. And so like, it is, I guess, a little bit of a weird, like thing for libertarians like us to be [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2540.88s)]
*  saying. It's not our ideal scenario in the world. It's just accepting the world as it is. But like, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2546.56s)]
*  yeah, I guess it kind of sucks to be a little state next to a big, more powerful state. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2552.88s)]
*  You know, just as Kamala Harris explained, Russia is a great big country, Ukraine's a small country. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2558.08s)]
*  But like, that is kind of the way of the world. And the idea that we can just undo that is not [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2563.44s)]
*  living in reality. Especially when we're the ones doing it. I mean, this is the whole thing, you [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2569.28s)]
*  know, the famous Henry Kissinger quote, where he says, to be America's enemy is dangerous, to be [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2573.36s)]
*  America's friend is fatal. What he was talking about was building up groups and then stabbing [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2578.64s)]
*  them in the back, leaving them high and dry. And I forget exactly, I think he's talking about the [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2584.56s)]
*  Kurds then, which he betrayed the Kurds at least twice himself, I think. It may have been a reference [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2588.56s)]
*  to the Hmong tribesmen of Laos and kind of north, I think, northwestern Vietnam that the CIA backed [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2595.7599999999998s)]
*  them to take on the North Vietnamese. And then it was like, okay, well, we're leaving. Good luck [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2603.44s)]
*  to you guys. After we just, you know, encourage you to turn yourselves into the avowed deadly [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2607.84s)]
*  enemies of these people who have so much more power than you do. So bye. And didn't even help [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2613.6s)]
*  them get out of there, you know? They do the same thing to the Kurds over and over again. I don't [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2620.56s)]
*  know, the Iraqi Kurds are in a pretty good spot with America now, but they've been stabbed in the [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2624.4s)]
*  back by America at least twice in the 1980s. And then again, after the end of the First Iraq War, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2629.12s)]
*  and then the Syrian Kurds in Turkey, pardon me, in northeastern Syria, claim we love them and then [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2637.12s)]
*  built up the Islamist caliphate that became their absolute deadly enemy when it conquered, you know, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2646.64s)]
*  all of that land in eastern Syria and western Iraq. We had to go in there and fight another war for [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2652.48s)]
*  them. And we're still there protecting them now. Otherwise what? They'll be overrun by our other [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2656.64s)]
*  allies, the Turks, and they're again agents on the move, Al Qaeda, that now rules Damascus and the [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2661.8399999999997s)]
*  rest of western Syria. And this kind of thing happens over and over again. And so here, I mean, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2668.3199999999997s)]
*  what could be a worse thing than to get your friend into a fight that you know he can't win? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2673.3599999999997s)]
*  And then to keep pushing them out there, stay out there. Lindsey Graham, quote unquote, how dare you [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2679.44s)]
*  not lower your draft age to 18? Right now it's 25, but they try to send the older men to the front [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2685.6s)]
*  and leave the younger men behind to do, you know, equipment and logistics and whatever, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2693.2799999999997s)]
*  the background stuff, because their population is decimated and they're terrified of losing all [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2700.64s)]
*  their reproductive age males. And so they're sending all middle-aged guys to go and get [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2706.56s)]
*  ground up. And then Lindsey Graham won't stand for it and stomps his foot and says, the draft [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2712.24s)]
*  age should be 18 and those boys should be at the front. How in the hell are you ever going to win [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2716.8799999999997s)]
*  this war? If you don't send your 18 year olds to the front, which is, I'm sorry, but just none of [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2721.04s)]
*  his damn business to be insisting that another nation do to sacrifice for his what? His goals [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2726.56s)]
*  for them or his goals for America's geopolitical contest with Russia? Where they, you know, there's [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2733.12s)]
*  a clip of, was it Kissinger or, I confuse these absolute idiot Russiagate Democrats from the [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2739.12s)]
*  house day from that era. I think it was Kissinger was saying just yesterday, there was a clip going [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2747.04s)]
*  around on X of him saying that, look, we're killing Russians and no American soldiers are dying. It's [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2753.52s)]
*  the best bang for a buck we've ever spent. And I have a whole section of quotations like that in [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2760.4s)]
*  the book where over and over again, these pundits and writers and politicians in America say this [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2765.92s)]
*  and in numerous cases, they don't even mention the Ukrainian deaths at all. They'll say [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2772.88s)]
*  Russian soldiers are dying and American soldiers are being preserved. It's great. So the Russian [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2780.0s)]
*  soldiers have lives to be degraded and our soldiers have, or their lives have value to be degraded [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2786.2400000000002s)]
*  and our soldiers lives have value to be preserved. The Ukrainians aren't even worth mentioning at all. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2792.4s)]
*  As you remember, was it over there? Do you, do you remember? I'm sure you'll remember because [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2798.1600000000003s)]
*  you're Scott Horton. Do you remember, I think it was Wolf Blitzer who asked Rand Paul a few years [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2802.88s)]
*  back about Yemen and he seemed kind of confused. And he went like, so, so to you, this is a moral [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2810.6400000000003s)]
*  issue. He was like, because what I'm hearing is like, this is really good for business. But like, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2816.6400000000003s)]
*  so you're saying you have a moral problem with backing a genocide, you know, like it. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2822.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he even said like, this could really cost the American arms firms that are [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2826.64s)]
*  selling these weapons. And Rand Paul was as flabbergasted as Wolf Blitzer. Like, what did [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2830.24s)]
*  you just say to, I'm as confused as you are, Wolf, what in the world, man? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2835.36s)]
*  I had my version of this moment when I was debating Josh Hammer at Princeton a few weeks ago. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2841.6s)]
*  And he turned to me at one of it. One of his questions to me was, he was like, so, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2847.92s)]
*  so do you make moral considerations when considering foreign policy? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2853.44s)]
*  And I was like, almost taken back by the question. I was like, well, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2858.0s)]
*  like, yeah, yeah, that's a big, that's a big part of it. Sure. And it, I just say that just to make [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2862.7200000000003s)]
*  the point that like, you kind of can't overstate how fucking evil these goddamn people's like [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2868.88s)]
*  worldview is like where they, they can totally just accept the idea that it's like, yeah, like [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2875.36s)]
*  this is, I'm pushing a policy that will lead to slaughter, but I think that all things being [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2881.36s)]
*  considered, you know, it's Madeleine Albright, just like, yeah, that price is worth it. Was it [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2886.88s)]
*  500,000 dead kids? Okay. Worth it. Like that's the mentality. This is my fourth grade education [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2890.4s)]
*  in government school, man, is that, you know, when they teach you about war and stuff that, yeah, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2896.48s)]
*  civilians in the other country, they die, but that's their problem. That's not our problem to [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2900.96s)]
*  consider. And there may be, you know, they might allude to the Geneva conventions and some rules [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2906.48s)]
*  of war, but it's no sin to, for your government to kill people in another country. That's between [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2911.36s)]
*  them and their government, not between us and certainly, and then they'll turn it around and [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2918.8s)]
*  they'll say, no, see the evil, a moralist realist strategists, they only care about balance of power [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2923.92s)]
*  politics. They don't care about morality at all. We want a morality based foreign policy. That's [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2931.2000000000003s)]
*  why we have to invade Iraq to stop Saddam Hussein. Don't you know, he throws people in a giant human [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2937.52s)]
*  shredder and whatever nonsense they make up to invoke your emotions and say, yes, this is the [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2944.0s)]
*  morality based foreign policy. America can do no wrong in stopping evil around the world. So those [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2950.48s)]
*  are your two choices, either Henry Kissinger or Paul Wolfowitz. Yep. Do you remember, it was like, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2957.28s)]
*  I guess a couple of years to, oh, well, it must've been, it was the 20th anniversary of the war in [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2963.68s)]
*  Iraq. So two years ago, so that Brett Stevens wrote a piece in the New York Times called like [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2969.12s)]
*  20 years later, why I was still right. So it's like the, it's like the last guy defending the [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2976.8s)]
*  Iraq war. Like I think it's him and Shani. Yeah. And I think John Bolton, they're the last three in [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2982.48s)]
*  America. Those are the last like, it's like even John McCain, you know, admitted on his deathbed [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2988.96s)]
*  that it was bet, you know, it's, but there's, so he writes this piece about like 20 years later, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2994.2400000000002s)]
*  I was right to cheerlead the war in Iraq. You know, I think he was writing for an Israeli, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=2999.6800000000003s)]
*  I think it was written for the Jerusalem Post at the time. It was the editor. Isn't that, isn't that [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3004.72s)]
*  convenient? I don't know. Let's see how that works. But so, and he, and he writes this whole piece on, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3008.72s)]
*  and there was not one mention of the deaths from the war. It was just like a piece like, hey, Saddam [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3014.24s)]
*  Hussein was a brutal dictator and you know, now they're having some elections and they're an [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3019.7599999999998s)]
*  imperfect democracy, but they're coming up. That's definitely better than it was back then. And so as [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3023.3599999999997s)]
*  if you could take a snapshot of like, forget even the argument, which I think there's a pretty strong [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3027.52s)]
*  argument that for the average Iraqi life was actually better under Saddam Hussein, but [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3032.72s)]
*  regardless of that, the idea that like, you could take a snapshot of Iraq under Saddam Hussein and [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3036.56s)]
*  then take a snapshot of Iraq today. And if today is better than Saddam Hussein, then policy justified. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3042.8799999999997s)]
*  But like you're missing the part where you killed a million people in the middle of that. Like, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3049.12s)]
*  I don't know, life ain't better for them. It's over for them. I remember when Bill Clinton left [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3052.72s)]
*  office, he goes, well, at the end of the day, I like to think that we did a little bit more good [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3057.8399999999997s)]
*  than harm. Yeah, but there is, and it's almost like, you know, this is, it is some like, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3062.56s)]
*  collective like sociopathy, like there's something about when you, when you get, when you have a [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3072.64s)]
*  mentality that like, people can be crushed. And that, you know what I mean? People are essentially [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3080.0s)]
*  pawns on a chessboard. And as long as you're moving in the right direction, then it doesn't, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3087.92s)]
*  that's like an irrelevant factor. It is unbelievable the levels of evil that that can lead to. And then [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3093.6s)]
*  you end up supporting something like, you know, all these people getting slaughtered in Ukraine for [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3099.6s)]
*  nothing, all for nothing. Yep. And look, just like on the Pierce Morgan show yesterday, and anybody [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3104.56s)]
*  can log on to X and see it all day. The Hawks, they only talk in these vague analogies and they [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3110.32s)]
*  only talk in glittering generalities. And they say, oh, we're turning our back and stabbing our [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3116.24s)]
*  friends in the back and all these things. They never say, what's the solution to the problem? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3120.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, what we need to do is send in the 82nd airborne and the U S Navy. And that would solve [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3126.08s)]
*  the problem. Right? Like if we put, if we did like George W. Bush in Iraq and sent the third [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3132.0s)]
*  infantry division and the Marine Corps and everybody in there to break things as much as possible, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3137.12s)]
*  then yeah, potentially they could drive the Russians out of Ukraine, South and East. They [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3143.12s)]
*  could also potentially start a hydrogen bomb war, which Joe Biden was not willing to risk [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3149.12s)]
*  to that degree. Right. He has some special operations forces there serving as advisors [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3155.52s)]
*  and stuff like that. But I don't, I've never seen that our guys are on there. I'm fighting there. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3160.3199999999997s)]
*  They're picking targets pretty close to fighting, but they weren't willing to risk that. Nobody's [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3164.16s)]
*  willing to really risk that. So this is the same thing that Obama said to Jeffrey Goldberg back in [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3170.4s)]
*  2014, that ultimately Ukraine is not really a vital American interest. It is a vital Russian one. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3175.52s)]
*  And it's going to always mean more to them than us. And if we're not really, as he put it, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3182.1600000000003s)]
*  if people in Washington want to say that we should go to war for the Donbass and let them say that, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3187.12s)]
*  I don't hear anybody saying that. So if you're not willing to say that, then I don't know why [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3191.2000000000003s)]
*  we should sort of half ass it essentially. Well, it's cause well, essentially because [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3195.6800000000003s)]
*  he overthrew the government and he was responsible for the spots of Crimea as he admits in there. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3200.56s)]
*  It was a reaction to our transition of the government there, he said, which was completely [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3205.12s)]
*  correct. But he was also right. But now what are we going to do? We're going to double down. We're [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3209.6s)]
*  going to fight a war in the Donbass. No, we're not going to. Well, it's, it's, it's an important [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3213.28s)]
*  point to make because you're essentially calling their bluff. And you know, it's like, I, I've made [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3219.04s)]
*  this point a lot just during, during the last eight years of Donald Trump being the biggest [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3223.84s)]
*  political figure where it's like, and it was really never more apparent than when he got shot. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3228.96s)]
*  And really, I think this is a huge part of what won him the election is that it immediately just [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3235.28s)]
*  called all of their bluffs. Cause like, you can't, you can't wish Hitler a speedy recovery, man. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3241.52s)]
*  Like if you do, then you didn't really believe he was Hitler. Like one or the, you know what I'm [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3247.52s)]
*  saying? Like it's like, if you're gonna, if you're gonna talk the way MSNBC talks every day, then [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3251.04s)]
*  stay consistent, celebrate when a dude takes a shot at him. Man, it's a shame he missed, right? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3256.16s)]
*  I mean, if you're really telling me that a Hitlerian figure has, has risen and is, is the end of our [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3260.4s)]
*  democracy, then why exactly shouldn't I be rooting for that guy to get shot? And in a similar sense, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3265.92s)]
*  you know, I'll, the, the, all these guys, they're making the argument that we don't have to be [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3271.68s)]
*  worried about nuclear war. Putin's bluffing. He would never actually do that, but he is [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3276.88s)]
*  reconstituting the Soviet Union and it's the most important fight for democracy ever that we maintain [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3281.68s)]
*  Ukrainian, you know, I don't know what, what was Ukraine a democracy for five minutes? I mean, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3288.24s)]
*  like, I don't know what, like I guess in 2014 they overthrew the democratically elected leader and [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3294.08s)]
*  then I guess they had a couple of elections in between there and then they suspended elections. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3299.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, right, right. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3304.56s)]
*  They suspended a portion of it, right. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3306.32s)]
*  George Soros bragged to the New Yorker in 1995 that he rigged the election of 1994. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3308.4s)]
*  And then you had America overthrow and intervene in the election of 2004 and the orange revolution. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3313.7599999999998s)]
*  Then they had a legit election in 2010. They overthrew that guy in 2013, 14. So, so yeah, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3320.56s)]
*  it's not much of a democracy. And that's why, you know, even George Soros is Transparency [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3329.2s)]
*  International ranks them with the lowest kleptocracies on the planet, the most corrupt [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3333.36s)]
*  countries in the world. Their, their political and economic system are just nothing but cronyism from [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3338.0s)]
*  top to bottom and everybody knows it and nobody can even lie about it with a straight face. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3344.4s)]
*  I was part of Biden's like somewhat convincing excuse for going after the prosecutor there was [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3348.4s)]
*  the prosecutor wasn't going after everybody enough. Now he really ran up against the laugh test when [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3355.52s)]
*  he said he was mad that they weren't prosecuting his son's company. Wait a minute. But, but boy, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3360.56s)]
*  is there a lot of corruption for him to go after there if he was picking the right sides, you know? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3366.96s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's exactly right. And it's always been corrupt under every under the Yanukovych [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3372.56s)]
*  government, Prashenko's government, Zelensky's government. There's always just been like [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3377.92s)]
*  rampant corruption in, in, in Ukraine. It has got, but what was it? Yanukovych's son, I think, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3381.12s)]
*  was like the fifth richest man in Ukraine and he was like a dentist. Like it just didn't even [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CM1YTuWZxc&t=3385.92s)]
