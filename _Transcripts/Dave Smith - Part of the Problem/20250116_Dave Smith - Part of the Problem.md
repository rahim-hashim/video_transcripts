# Dave Smith | Biden's Farewell Address | Part Of The Problem 1219
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc)

*  So come on out to all those shows comicdavesmith.com for all the ticket links. How are you this morning or this afternoon Rob? What's new? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=54.3s)]
*  Well you muted [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=63.7s)]
*  Yeah, there's all sorts of chaos going on upstairs. I press the mute button. There's too much happening [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=66.22s)]
*  You know, I'm getting a little too excited for Trump around too in the end of Biden. There you go [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=71.02s)]
*  Well there that is the theme for today's show [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=77.38s)]
*  Joe Biden just gave his farewell address to the nation [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=80.82s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=86.82s)]
*  Man, it really is. It's unbelievable as I'm sure people are kind of familiar [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=88.62s)]
*  Presidents give farewell addresses to the nation. This is a long-standing tradition [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=94.34s)]
*  It is particularly weird to see Joe Biden do it [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=100.3s)]
*  Just because this is such a bizarre presidency that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=104.7s)]
*  Truly feels surreal [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=108.61999999999999s)]
*  it does not feel like the man is the president of the United States of America because he really kind of isn't and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=110.22s)]
*  Really hasn't been for if he ever was it's at least been a long time since he was [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=116.33999999999999s)]
*  Typically [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  You know we could go through this. I don't even know if I [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  Typically what we do is like the legacy of Joe Biden episode [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=129.1s)]
*  Which is essentially what this is but I think we're just gonna play through his farewell address and kind of discuss some of the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=133.78s)]
*  Some of the I was gonna say points he makes but I don't know if you could actually describe them as points [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=139.74s)]
*  I don't feel like there's that much that we really have to harp on we could spend a few minutes of it here [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  If you're gonna talk about the Biden legacy, it's actually much simpler than previous [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=152.10000000000002s)]
*  presidents partly because he was only in for four years [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=159.58s)]
*  And partly because his legacy is pretty straightforward [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=163.06s)]
*  It's not even Donald Trump who at the end of his term had only done four years [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=166.62s)]
*  If you were to ask yourself, what is the legacy of Donald Trump? There's there was so much to talk about [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=171.38s)]
*  He was the guy who reinvented the way that you could do politics the first president who was didn't have any political or military [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=177.34s)]
*  Experience he was the first president who the corporate media and the deep state were open [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=187.18s)]
*  Lee hostile to in our lifetimes there was just so much there [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=193.02s)]
*  With Joe Biden. It's pretty straightforward [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=198.02s)]
*  the number one thing in Joe Biden's legacy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=200.22s)]
*  Whether this should be the case or not. It's just the way things work [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=204.82000000000002s)]
*  That's the way the world works [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  His number one legacy is being a senile old man who was clearly not [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=210.62s)]
*  competent enough to be president of the United States, but [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  That's just it like it doesn't matter. You know, it's like [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=219.58s)]
*  If me and you like if I was running late somewhere [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=223.74s)]
*  And I told you I would be there on time and you told me it was really important that i'd be there on time [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  And i'm late [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=232.3s)]
*  And I show up late and then when I show up late you go god fucking damn it dave [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=233.74s)]
*  I've always fucking hated you you're a piece of shit. I hope bad things happen to your family. You're just a terrible human being [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=237.82000000000002s)]
*  after that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  The conversation is just no longer about whether I was late or not [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=246.22s)]
*  Or whether I gave my word i'd be there on time. It's like okay now we need to have a new conversation [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=250.54s)]
*  What the hell was that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=255.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like it's just that once once you're pooping your pants on national television [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  Policy just isn't the first thing that people are thinking of anymore [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=261.82s)]
*  The joe biden's true legacy is that he was so goddamn senile and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=265.02s)]
*  He demonstrated through that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=271.02s)]
*  That the entire corporate media and hollywood and the political class would just play this game of the emperor's new clothes and pretend [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=273.41999999999996s)]
*  That we didn't have a senile man in the white house [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=281.97999999999996s)]
*  aside from that his legacy is [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=285.18s)]
*  Forcing the goddamn covid vaccine on as many people as he could [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=288.62s)]
*  While selling it based off lies [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  It was funding insane proxy wars in ukraine and in israel [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  And it was his disastrous de facto open border policy [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  You know you could go ahead and give any thoughts you have rob [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=307.5s)]
*  But to me it's really that straightforward we're a few minutes into the show and I think that's joe biden's legacy [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=309.74s)]
*  There's not that much we've talked about this for years at this point [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't know what else there is but take a stab at it. What else is joe biden's legacy? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=317.26000000000005s)]
*  I would add two things to that list although that's very well said [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=321.98s)]
*  I would just add the uh tech censorship and weaponizing the justice department [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  Yes, I think that very good point particularly. Yes, very good point [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=329.5s)]
*  I think that those are also, uh are their authoritarian maneuvers that uh, most presidents have not wielded or at least not to his degree [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=332.94s)]
*  uh, and on that note he really is uh [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=341.18s)]
*  I I know that they're all liars [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=345.58s)]
*  But there's something about the way that he lies and how bold face and aggressive he is [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=347.66s)]
*  And that sometimes his lies don't even make sense like in his farewell speech. He goes [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=353.02s)]
*  Hey guys, i've done incredible things. This has been the most successful presidency, but you're all going to die because of global warming [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=358.14s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah, we're about to we're about to play it [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=364.54s)]
*  Yes, but that's right [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=366.94s)]
*  The seeds that I planted for the future are going to reap massive benefits [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=368.06s)]
*  And that's the only reason you don't realize quite how great I am and also I could have won [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=372.38s)]
*  But I stepped down to be nice because I know that I couldn't win [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=377.26s)]
*  Um, but he's just and then when he starts talking about the tech censorship and it's the most [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=380.86s)]
*  1984 or wellian pitch ever that the tech companies are out of control and that they're being authoritative and there's too much [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=385.88s)]
*  Misinformation and that's why government needs to control them [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  um, I mean [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=396.7s)]
*  Yeah, hold your thoughts on the speech because we'll get into that but you're absolutely right. I mean literally that's the my exact take on that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=397.5s)]
*  I would say let's we're gonna play uh, joe budden's farewell address here. We might skip around a little bit [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=405.58s)]
*  We'll start it from the beginning. Um [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=411.18s)]
*  But I will say this I didn't watch the entire thing I got to the point that you're talking about though [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=413.82s)]
*  Interestingly enough he ends up invoking [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=420.76s)]
*  um dwight d eisenhower [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=423.82s)]
*  In the speech, I I swear my first thought as I was watching the few the first few minutes of it was just [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=426.22s)]
*  You know, I remember talking about this when uh when I had tucker carlson on the show [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=435.58s)]
*  But if you go I I'd highly recommend by the way to everybody go watch, uh, dwight d eisenhower's farewell address to the nation [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=439.18s)]
*  It's it's very interesting number one. He is I believe I believe he coins the term the military industrial complex in that speech [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=445.74s)]
*  um, this was not a [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=454.22s)]
*  A term that was used in popular discourse. Um [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=455.9s)]
*  that part of the speech is very interesting, but [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=461.02s)]
*  one of the things that really stands out to you is just [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=464.54s)]
*  Dwight eisenhower and i'm not a big eisenhower fan, but he was a serious person [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=469.42s)]
*  um, and he spoke to the american people in [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=475.58s)]
*  As if they weren't idiots [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=480.54s)]
*  Like he spoke on at a high level to people with the expectation that they would understand this and that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=482.7s)]
*  That theme almost like kind of blinded everything out of the rest of it for me because it's impossible to not just like [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=490.14s)]
*  Focus on the elephant in the room, which is just that like [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=497.82s)]
*  What a demonstration [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=502.21999999999997s)]
*  Of the degree to which we've been degraded as a nation [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=505.18s)]
*  where [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=509.82s)]
*  This bumbling fool and and joe biden was always a dummy before he lost his mind [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=511.18s)]
*  I mean before he was so old that he's clearly suffering through some some significant cognitive decline [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=518.06s)]
*  He was never an impressive guy you could go [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=524.7s)]
*  I mean look if you go back and find clips of joe biden in the 80s and the 90s [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=527.34s)]
*  He he could speak [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=531.9s)]
*  He wasn't an old man who was incapable of putting sentences together. There was never particularly impressive [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=533.74s)]
*  But now to just watch this version of joe biden, it's just unbelievably sad [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=539.1s)]
*  It's a sad comment on who we are as a people, you know [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=545.34s)]
*  The and again this isn't a comment on whether he's a good guy or a bad guy [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=549.9s)]
*  I would argue he's a bad guy and he's done a lot of evil in his life. Um, but [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=554.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean like joe biden as as in terms of his legacy as his career [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=561.1s)]
*  Like we're just talking about presidency [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=565.34s)]
*  But if you're including him as a vice president as a senator [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=567.02s)]
*  I mean he's on record supporting the most disastrous policies all in on the war on drugs [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=569.66s)]
*  All in on the iraq war all in on all of these policies that we all kind of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=575.0200000000001s)]
*  There's pretty broad consensus that like those policies were failures and failures that resulted in carnage, you know [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  but [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=588.1400000000001s)]
*  Just watching this [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=589.1800000000001s)]
*  it's like [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=591.34s)]
*  Wow, how you know look I think vladimir putin has done a lot of evil things [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=592.7s)]
*  um, and this this most recent war in ukraine, of course is the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=598.0600000000001s)]
*  At the top of that list [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=602.06s)]
*  But if you listen to tucker carlson interview him or you listen to a vladimir putin speech [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=603.66s)]
*  He's talking about you know, like 600 years of history giving his takes on all of the different events [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=608.62s)]
*  He knows about the different events. He's talking about the you know clinton backing the bin latinites the bin latinites in chechnya [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=614.2199999999999s)]
*  He's talking about the madon revolution. He's talking about the historic relationship between ukraine and and russia now [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=621.5s)]
*  You could disagree with everything he says about them [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=627.02s)]
*  Um, I certainly don't although I disagree with a lot of it, but he's like [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=630.0600000000001s)]
*  A reasonably intelligent man who's like a compelling figure [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=635.58s)]
*  This is true with leaders around the world and this was true with u.s presidents for a long time [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=639.34s)]
*  And so that was like the most startling thing to me of all of it [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=644.86s)]
*  By the way, I would say from the portion that I watched he managed to not flub up too bad [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=649.74s)]
*  Like, you know, I don't think you know, I think the better bidens we've seen over the years [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=655.26s)]
*  Yes, that's right. So at least we could give him some credit for that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=659.74s)]
*  Grading on a joe biden curve. He got a didn't poop your pants was his score on this one [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=663.98s)]
*  Uh, all right. Let's start. Let's start playing it and and we can go through some of this [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=670.46s)]
*  I'm speaking to you tonight from the oval office [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=676.7s)]
*  Before I began let me speak to important news that from earlier today [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=680.14s)]
*  After eight months of non-stop negotiation [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=684.62s)]
*  My administration [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  By my administration a ceasefire and hostage deal has been reached by israel and hamas [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=689.52s)]
*  The elements of which I laid out in great detail in may this year [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=695.84s)]
*  This plan was developed and negotiated by my team [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=701.2800000000001s)]
*  And will be largely implemented by the incoming administration [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=705.2800000000001s)]
*  That's why I told my team to keep the incoming administration fully informed [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=709.6s)]
*  All right, let's let's pause it here already because it's just together [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=714.08s)]
*  it's so obviously he's got to try to take credit for this, you know, but [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=718.08s)]
*  It sure is interesting that you had this deal in may [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=723.7600000000001s)]
*  And it's only now [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  Being agreed to and it only coincidentally happened right after trump's envoy went there and put pressure on the israeli government [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  So again to for joe biden to try to say oh well, we worked out these deals [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=738.4000000000001s)]
*  There's nothing to the deal the deal was accepted by hamas back then in may [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=744.08s)]
*  They were willing to do it [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  The impediment was israel and so the question wasn't like fine tuning the deal [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  The question was can you get any pressure on israel now again? This is still all [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=756.96s)]
*  Wide open we have no idea whether this is ultimately going to be a good thing or what's going to come from this [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=762.1600000000001s)]
*  but biden trying to take credit for it is just it's [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=767.2s)]
*  sad [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=771.12s)]
*  I watched that and I think he still got it [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=773.2s)]
*  Yeah, right taking credit for other people's work. That's politicking at its best [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=775.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, there you go. Um, but it is just like obviously on the face of it. It's like well, okay [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=780.4s)]
*  But so then why is the deal being agreed to now? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=786.96s)]
*  Your people who were working tirelessly on it did what recently that happened to come? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=790.08s)]
*  A couple days after the reports at that trump's envoy went there and insisted that they they make the agreement [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=796.16s)]
*  You know if you want to try to spin this, I mean obviously he's got no other option [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=802.96s)]
*  But to try to spin this in some way that it's his guys who got it done and technically trump isn't in the white house [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=807.28s)]
*  And it is his people who are in charge now of implementing this at least for a few days [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=814.56s)]
*  But [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=820.4s)]
*  It's very obvious what happened the timing on this is just the timing alone makes it very obvious [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=821.52s)]
*  What this was and and look to be clear to the extent that donald trump was able to put any pressure on netanyahu [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=828.08s)]
*  Joe biden was in a position to put this pressure on him since not may but since october of [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=834.72s)]
*  2023 so [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=840.38s)]
*  He failed to do that. Um, all right, let's keep playing [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=842.48s)]
*  So [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=845.2s)]
*  As americans [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=848.48s)]
*  This will be my final address to you from the american people from the oval office from this desk as president [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=850.72s)]
*  And i've been thinking a lot about who we are [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=856.96s)]
*  And maybe more importantly who we should be [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=860.08s)]
*  long ago [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  In new york harbor an iron worker installed beam after beam day after day [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=864.5600000000001s)]
*  He was joined by steel workers stone masons engineers [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=871.12s)]
*  They built not just a single structure [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=875.76s)]
*  But a beacon of freedom [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=878.24s)]
*  The very idea of america was so big [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=881.0400000000001s)]
*  We felt the entire world needed to see [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=884.0s)]
*  the statute of liberty [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=886.96s)]
*  A gift from france after our civil war [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=889.12s)]
*  Like the very idea of america. It was built not by one person but by many people [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=892.32s)]
*  from every background [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  And from around the world [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=898.72s)]
*  Like america [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=901.0400000000001s)]
*  The statute of liberty is not standing still [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=902.56s)]

*  She's on the march [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=911.8399999999999s)]
*  And she literally moves [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=913.68s)]
*  She was built to sway back and forth to withstand the fury of stormy weather [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=916.2399999999999s)]

*  She sways a few inches, but she never falls into the current below [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=925.28s)]
*  an engineering marvel [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=929.68s)]

*  Or the power of our example [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1009.2s)]

*  You know, like if you just don't know I guess he's saying stuff but all of that could be reduced to nothingness. I mean just [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1028.4s)]

*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is cal she [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  Are you happy with who won the presidential election or how many seats the democrats or republicans took? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1048.0s)]
*  Well, there's finally a legal way to bet on the outcome of the next election a platform called cal she [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  Cal she is the first legal exchange where you can trade or bet on any event including but not limited to elections [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1058.96s)]
*  Cal she went to court and won legal approval for election betting for the first time in over a hundred years [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1066.48s)]
*  They have markets on who will win the presidential election who will control the house and the senate who will win swing states and more [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1072.64s)]

*  I what what are the seeds of all the immigrants that came over the border? Is that are those seeds all these people? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1614.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's all just seeds [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1620.02s)]
*  Yeah, everything well, it's a it's a good point that you make because even by like Keynesian economic doctrine [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1622.5s)]
*  Right like the years of high spending you're supposed to be doing for a short-term boom [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1628.82s)]
*  And then when you pull back, it's supposed to be for long-term thing. You know what I mean? And so you're right that [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1634.42s)]
*  What he's talking about presiding over these years where spending was like basically, you know wasn't even [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1641.46s)]
*  Reversed back to pre-covid levels. They just had his entire administration at that at these spending levels [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1647.46s)]
*  We should be feeling this right now [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1653.54s)]
*  This shouldn't be just seeds being planted, but of course when you have no tangible results to point to [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1655.38s)]
*  That's a very convenient argument to be like well what you're looking at [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1662.5800000000002s)]
*  This is all going to be very very positive in years to come. Yes [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1665.6200000000001s)]
*  It's all gonna we'll all recognize that we were wrong about what a disaster this administration was [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1669.0600000000002s)]
*  All right, let's keep going. It goes it goes on to lie more. I interrupted you in the middle of a jobs claim [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1674.9s)]
*  Oh, yes. Yes, which you know, I mean we should we should address that too [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1679.38s)]
*  It is funny to say like oh we've created 17 million jobs. It's like yeah like [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1682.66s)]
*  Coming off locking down the country [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1690.1000000000001s)]
*  When the lockdowns ended people did go back to work [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1693.0600000000002s)]
*  But for joe biden to claim credit for that, especially when the democrats were the champions of the lockdowns and actually their biggest [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1696.9s)]
*  Criticism of donald trump was that he didn't lock down enough or hard enough or fast enough or for long enough [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1704.16s)]
*  Um, that is a pretty wild thing to claim but yeah there [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1710.5s)]
*  Well, look at that if I if I shut down the economy and I don't have to I don't have to be criticized for any [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1715.22s)]
*  Of the jobs I destroyed but then I reopen the economy and I just get to take credit for all the jobs that I created [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1720.82s)]
*  And yeah, that's that's a fun game, isn't it? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1726.74s)]
*  You're right buddy [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1732.34s)]
*  I'm looking up the stacks. I also think that a lot of the jobs that were actually created under biden was foreign-born workers [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1734.74s)]
*  Which does not necessarily mean not us citizens [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1742.26s)]
*  Uh, but right just trying to look up the stat real quick [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1746.02s)]
*  So anyways, i'm okay i'm not gonna stroke on you. All right, let's keep playing [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1751.86s)]
*  Administration a single term more people have health care than ever before [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1757.36s)]
*  And overseas we strengthen nato ukraine is still free [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1763.06s)]
*  And we pulled ahead of our competition with china [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1768.34s)]
*  We're gonna have to pause it right there [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1771.3799999999999s)]
*  holy moly [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1774.48s)]
*  Ukraine is still free [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1777.52s)]
*  What a claim [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1780.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know what I could say about this ukraine is free. Don't you wish you were as free as ukraine rob? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1782.1s)]
*  The beacon of freedom they are first of all to ever describe a country [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1789.22s)]
*  That is fighting a war [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1795.8600000000001s)]
*  in its own [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1798.26s)]
*  On its own land like fighting an invading army. I don't think you can call it a free country when [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1800.1000000000001s)]
*  50 plus year old, um mentally ill people are being grabbed and forced to the front lines [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1808.02s)]
*  That's a little bit different than my conception of liberty [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1814.66s)]
*  I don't know about you rob, but it seems pretty tough to brag about keeping a country free [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1817.94s)]
*  As the country's being leveled. Yeah, they're about as free as gaza [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1824.3400000000001s)]
*  Just a just a beacon of freedom over there in in ukraine. I mean that is a wild [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1828.74s)]
*  Wild blatant lie to claim that ukraine is free [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1836.18s)]

*  freedom [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1871.24s)]
*  These things of course are all if the word freedom means anything then what's going on in ukraine is the antithesis of it [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1872.6000000000001s)]
*  They're free to fight on our behalf, which yeah, right there do so [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1880.3600000000001s)]
*  They're free to die essentially. All right, let's keep playing [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1884.76s)]
*  I'm so proud of how much we've accomplished together for the american people [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1891.16s)]
*  And I wish the incoming administration success [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1896.04s)]
*  Because I want america to succeed [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1898.8400000000001s)]
*  That's why I have held my duty to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition of power [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1902.04s)]
*  To ensure we lead by the power of our example [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1908.1200000000001s)]
*  I have no doubt that america is in a position to continue to succeed [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1912.2s)]
*  That's why my farewell address tonight [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1916.44s)]
*  I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1919.24s)]
*  This is a dangerous country and that's the dangerous concentration of power [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1924.52s)]
*  In the hands of a very few ultra wealthy people [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1928.68s)]
*  the dangerous consequences [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1931.88s)]
*  If their abuse of power is left unchecked [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1934.28s)]
*  today [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1937.64s)]
*  An oligarchy is taking shape in america of extreme wealth power and influence [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1939.16s)]
*  That literally threatens our entire democracy. This is one of the seeds he's talking about by the way are basically the seeds for success that he was able to lay down [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1943.8s)]
*  Uh include this uh growing oligarchy that happened under his watch and might overtake america. That's the seeds of success everybody [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1951.0s)]
*  Yeah, it really is like an unbelievable like that's [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1958.68s)]
*  That's your your concern that an oligarchy is rising while you brag about the success of your administration [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1962.1200000000001s)]
*  And we're all by the way supposed to sit here and pretend that the united states of america isn't and hasn't been an oligarchy [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1968.68s)]
*  For at least a hundred years [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1976.28s)]
*  What are you talking about? I'm like, please joe biden go ahead define oligarchy for me [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1978.52s)]
*  Go ahead [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1983.88s)]
*  And and let's use an objective measurement of it what the government isn't really run by the people you mean [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1985.88s)]
*  You are you mean to tell me that powerful vested interests are the ones who are really in charge [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1992.5200000000002s)]
*  I mean like what a joke [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=1998.68s)]
*  Does anybody does anybody anybody? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2001.4s)]
*  With a functioning brain, so we're excluding joe biden now. Does anybody actually believe that like the [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2005.4s)]
*  George w bush and barack obama bailed out the big banks because that's what's in our interest [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2013.16s)]
*  Or or even that they believed that that was in our interest [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2019.96s)]
*  You think that's why the banks got bailed out because they you know what I mean? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2022.76s)]
*  They really just thought like oh, this is really what's good for the american people [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2027.24s)]
*  Or is it perhaps the case that the big banks have just a little bit more influence over the federal government than the american people though [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2031.24s)]
*  Like what are we talking about? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2038.3600000000001s)]
*  Um, but he's very concerned you see about the concentration of power [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2040.12s)]
*  Yes, that's that has always been [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2045.32s)]
*  That's always been washington dc's number one concern rob. They just hate concentrated power there in dc [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2047.8799999999999s)]
*  That's what joe biden's always against too much power being concentrated in one area [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2054.6s)]
*  That's what the president has a real issue with [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2059.88s)]
*  All right, let's keep playing [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2062.92s)]
*  Rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2065.88s)]
*  We see the consequences all across america [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2072.28s)]
*  And we've seen it before [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2075.48s)]
*  more than a century ago [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2077.4s)]
*  But the american people stood up for the robber barons back then [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2080.04s)]
*  And busted the trust [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2084.2000000000003s)]
*  They didn't punish the wealthy [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2086.76s)]
*  Just made the wealthy pay that by played by the rules everybody else had [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2088.76s)]
*  Workers want rights to earn their fair share [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2092.76s)]
*  You know they were dealt into the deal [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2097.08s)]
*  And helped put us on a path to building the largest middle class [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2099.96s)]
*  Most prosperous century any nation in the world has ever seen [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2104.2000000000003s)]
*  We've got to do that again [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2109.0s)]
*  The last four years that's exactly what we pause it for a second there just because like I [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2111.56s)]
*  You know, you can almost like not even blame joe biden for this [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2115.96s)]
*  This is just like washington dc is like, you know bad history [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2118.44s)]
*  But the idea that like that's the story of america is such fucking bullshit [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2122.84s)]
*  The idea that the story is that like there there were these robber barons just these evil robber barons [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2127.4s)]
*  You know these rich people who were just how were they rich? I don't know from being evil, you know from being a little [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2133.4s)]
*  Monopoly man or something like that and and what happened was the workers rose up and they busted the trusts they [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2140.02s)]
*  Busted them up. They broke up their companies and then because the rich had to like share these extravagant companies [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2146.8399999999997s)]
*  We built the biggest middle class first of all [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2153.88s)]
*  None of that is how it happened is just not accurate history [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2157.24s)]
*  And number two this thing like it comes down to a math question almost more than anything else, right? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2160.6s)]
*  Like there just simply isn't listen today [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2166.44s)]
*  There isn't enough wealth [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2170.04s)]
*  Concentrated at the top that you could distribute it and make everybody material [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2172.44s)]
*  Materially better and there's so much more wealth today than there was back in the robber baron age [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2177.7s)]
*  Like this has nothing this is just totally ridiculous like the idea that you could have just gone and taken like [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2182.68s)]
*  Uh john d rockefeller's like all his wealth and just distributed it [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2189.96s)]
*  Around the united states of america and that would have made any meaningful difference. It's just nonsense [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2194.36s)]
*  you know, it's like they ever you ever think about like [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2198.84s)]
*  Put it in perspective like this. What is even with his latest like valuations? Do you know like ballpark? What elon musk is worth? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2201.8s)]
*  The richest man in the world. It's the reported 90 billion 110 somewhere between I think I think he's something like I think he's way above that [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2208.92s)]
*  Now I think that but now again to be clear [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2215.88s)]
*  When you talk about net worth, um, can you just look that up real quick natalie? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2219.08s)]
*  What's elon musk's net worth but to be clear when we talk about net worth [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2222.6000000000004s)]
*  It's not a real thing like net worth doesn't actually exist what what net where it says 416 billion dollars [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2226.9199999999996s)]
*  Okay, a lot of money now [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2233.48s)]
*  Now to be clear, I mean he was worth that not too long ago [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2235.56s)]
*  But I think his stuff has been the value has been going up [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2238.12s)]
*  But as you know rob net worth isn't a real thing, right? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2240.6s)]
*  so it's not if if people say elon musk has a [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2243.48s)]
*  416 billion net worth what they're talking about is um [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2248.18s)]
*  They're they're talking about the value of all of his [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2252.7599999999998s)]
*  Assets including his stocks, right? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2256.04s)]
*  But so like the stocks that he owns in tesla in twitter and whatever other companies or I guess the the percentage of the equity [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2259.0s)]
*  That he owns in these companies [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2267.2400000000002s)]
*  Let's say he wanted that money [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2269.4s)]
*  And he starts going i'm going to start selling off [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2271.4s)]
*  Shares [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2274.68s)]
*  Well, if if elon musk was like massively selling off shares in all of his company rob [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2275.72s)]
*  What's going to happen to the stock price going down plummet? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2280.04s)]
*  Is gonna plummet because they're like, oh my god, elon musk is trying to get out that must mean something, right? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2283.32s)]
*  So he can't actually get access to all of this money [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2288.28s)]
*  So just that being clear and then the reports of net worth are are often not exactly accurate [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2291.08s)]
*  But for the sake of argument, let's make it an even 500 billion dollars just to say that you know [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2296.04s)]
*  To make it an even number and and to say let's say this is undervalued elon musk is worth 500 billion dollars [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2302.76s)]
*  Okay [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2308.44s)]
*  If we were to take every cent of it we were to take every cent of elon musk's money [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2308.84s)]
*  And and let the government collect all of it [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2315.0s)]
*  What does that cover? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2318.28s)]
*  The government spends six trillion dollars a year. I think it's actually substantially higher than that now [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2319.96s)]
*  But I could go check but somewhere in the ballpark right north of six trillion dollars a year. So that is [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2325.8s)]
*  a 12th [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2332.52s)]
*  Of one year [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2334.28s)]
*  Of what our federal government spends [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2336.2000000000003s)]
*  If we cut 500 billion dollars from the budget there would not be drastic changes in this country [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2339.48s)]
*  I mean be a very positive step, but i'm just saying like it's not even you're not even covering a quarter [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2344.44s)]
*  Of one year of what our federal government spends with all this money. So anyway [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2350.84s)]
*  This is not by the way, you can look you can look all of this up [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2355.7200000000003s)]
*  Tom di lorenzo is actually done really really great work on this stuff [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2358.6000000000004s)]
*  but if you go look at say the robber barons like [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2362.52s)]
*  Uh standard oil was was uh, john d rockefeller's company, right? Well [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2365.48s)]
*  john d rockefeller built standard oil and it [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2370.84s)]
*  Literally it people uh, it created the kerosene lamps [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2374.7599999999998s)]
*  Regular people now could could get could see [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2379.72s)]
*  After the sun went down and could read a book [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2383.24s)]
*  I mean like the things that were not possible to do before that now regular people could do it also saved the whales [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2386.2s)]
*  People don't like to talk about this, but they used to kill whales [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2392.28s)]
*  To get whale blubber to burn lanterns if you could imagine trying to get whale blubber in [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2395.48s)]
*  1870 was rather expensive [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2402.1800000000003s)]
*  um, and now people could for very reasonably price have have an you know an oil lamp and like this really improved the standard of [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2404.6s)]
*  living for regular people [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2412.36s)]
*  But once when they broke up standard oil [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2414.12s)]
*  It had already fallen from being like 90 something percent of the market share to of oil refining to being down to in the 70s [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2416.6800000000003s)]
*  It was already coming down. There was already other competition. The truth about america is that [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2423.7200000000003s)]
*  from the end of the civil war from [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2429.4s)]
*  1865 until [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2432.5s)]
*  1913 we had no central bank no income tax no federal regulation barely any federal spending [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2434.26s)]
*  essentially [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2441.6200000000003s)]
*  The biggest experiment in human history in free market laissez-faire capitalism [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2443.08s)]
*  And that's what created the biggest middle class. That's what led to the century of american dominance [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2448.6s)]
*  Okay, not any not busting trusts and I would challenge anyone [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2453.88s)]
*  Anyone if they think they can make an argument that the wealth that was created in the united states of america [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2459.08s)]
*  Was a result i'll take the argument that it was a result of our free market policies [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2465.3199999999997s)]
*  And you take the argument that it was a result of busting trusts [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2469.16s)]
*  You explain to me how that created all the wealth in this country. I mean there's there's [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2473.08s)]
*  Simply no argument to be made on the other side here [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2479.72s)]

*  So joe biden's just but of course they have to spin this narrative is like it was government action [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2543.4s)]
*  That that created all of this wealth that's really what it was government breaking up big companies. That's why everyone got rich [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2548.52s)]
*  Anyway, let's keep playing [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2555.56s)]
*  People should be able to make as much as they can but pay play by the same rules pay their fair share of taxes [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2560.12s)]
*  So much is at stake. All right, let's pause it for a second here because this all this is the you know, the old democratic progressive [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2568.44s)]
*  Nonsense talking point, you know, it's interesting for all the time that they'll say this rub that uh, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2574.8399999999997s)]
*  That people have to pay their fair share. You know what question they'll never answer [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2579.96s)]
*  What's the fair share? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2586.04s)]
*  What is it [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2589.3199999999997s)]
*  What is the fair share like I make pretty good money. What's my fair share? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2590.6s)]
*  I I pay a lot of money in taxes [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2594.8399999999997s)]
*  I paid I paid more money in taxes this year than I made in my first decade of stand-up comedy [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2597.16s)]
*  It's a fact paid more money this year than I made in a decade [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2604.68s)]
*  And the only reason I make money now is because I put that decade in I paid more this year than I made it [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2608.2s)]
*  Is that fair? What's fair? 40% of my income 50% 60% 70% [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2613.48s)]
*  You want to always invoke your fair share, but you never want to say what it is [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2619.3199999999997s)]
*  Isn't that pretty ridiculous? And oh by the way, it's always more [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2624.2799999999997s)]
*  It's all it's always whatever it is [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2628.8399999999997s)]
*  If we raise taxes on the rich their fair share is more than what we just raised it to [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2630.68s)]
*  The truth is that the federal government as an apparatus is in the business of transferring wealth [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2635.3999999999996s)]
*  From the working class and middle class to the ultra rich [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2642.3599999999997s)]
*  And we could go through a million different policies in the way they do that by the way price inflation is one of the most effective [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2646.04s)]
*  One of the most effective ways to transfer wealth from working and poor people to super rich people [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2652.8399999999997s)]
*  Because what do you think happens to them super rich people they own stuff [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2658.3599999999997s)]
*  And when everything's getting more and more expensive that includes the stuff they own [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2663.7999999999997s)]
*  What they own is getting more expensive the value of their stocks and their homes and their and their you know [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2668.3599999999997s)]
*  Um all assets are going up [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2675.72s)]
*  If assets and commodities are going up the super rich are making their money [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2678.8399999999997s)]
*  But you know who loses people on a fixed income [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2683.16s)]
*  Uh people who are retired work at people who live paycheck to paycheck [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2686.28s)]
*  Those are the guys who gets to get destroyed and it's their wealth that's being taken and then given to the super rich [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2690.12s)]
*  You want to talk about transfers of wealth? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2695.96s)]
*  Take a look at lockdowns where every small and mid-sized business gets fucked over and the big businesses are the only ones left [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2698.2000000000003s)]
*  There's that's what's really going on here and this bullshit about the rich paying their fair share. It's just it's infuriating [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2705.96s)]
*  It's so sophomoric and retarded anyway. All right, let's keep playing [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2714.2999999999997s)]
*  Central threat of climate change has never been clear [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2719.8199999999997s)]

*  Of the future let's pause it [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2741.98s)]
*  I mean go ahead rob the president of the united states of america and make a claim [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2744.2999999999997s)]
*  That a hurricane and a forest fire [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2748.62s)]
*  Are a direct result of climate change [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2751.42s)]
*  It's a pretty large claim [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2754.86s)]
*  Are you substantiating that what evidence do you have nothing with nothing to substantiate it just asserted just asserted like that's just the facts [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2756.62s)]
*  Like we just know that we just said the whole climate change thing [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2764.7799999999997s)]
*  It's all predicated on such bullshit, but also again to the point you made earlier rob [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2767.58s)]
*  It's like these things are so diametrically opposed [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2773.2599999999998s)]
*  It's like climate change represents this existential threat to a point that like la's on fire right now because of it [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2776.06s)]
*  That's how bad things are [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2784.62s)]
*  Yet I did great [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2787.66s)]
*  Go invade china right now. I mean if california's on fire because of climate change and uh, you know [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2789.66s)]
*  The carbon emissions are going to lead to more forest fires and people dying in their homes burning [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2796.46s)]
*  I feel like we've been invaded by china. I mean now's the time for war [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2802.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, why why why are we going to risk? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2806.3s)]
*  We might as well risk nuclear war because we're dying anyways, and we've already been invaded and our community's already on fire [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2808.62s)]
*  Well, it kind of it reminds me of and you know not to take shots at him because he was a [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2815.58s)]
*  Nice enough guy to us, but you know, he's not going to be attorney general now [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2820.1400000000003s)]
*  So I can say it but it reminds me of matt gates coming on the show and telling me that he has evidence that iran [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2823.18s)]
*  Just tried to assassinate donald trump is trying to take it's like, okay [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2829.8999999999996s)]
*  So are you supporting invading iran right now? Because if that's true, isn't that an act of war? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2833.4199999999996s)]
*  Like why would we not be at war? Yeah, like why aren't why don't these progressives have to support bombing chinese factories? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2838.7799999999997s)]
*  Why the hell should we just allow them to destroy all life on the planet? Oh wait, i'm sorry [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2845.74s)]
*  It's because you don't really believe any of that [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2850.8599999999997s)]
*  The same way you wish adolf hitler a speedy recovery after he gets shot in the ear, right? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2853.2599999999998s)]
*  Because you never really believed he was adolf hitler [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2857.66s)]
*  The bottom line we've broken this down on the show before is that climate if you look at a chart [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2860.94s)]
*  Of climate related deaths, which is by the way, that's really what we care about to be clear here. We're on team human [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2867.02s)]
*  We're not on team earth [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2875.18s)]
*  It's like I I don't know like [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2877.58s)]
*  The issue is that the earth would ultimately be uninhabitable for us, right? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2880.14s)]
*  Not just that like oh my god, the soil is hurt [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2884.2999999999997s)]
*  The the argument isn't that species go extinct because that's what species do they go extinct [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2887.18s)]
*  99.9999 percent of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct. That's what happens [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2892.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay, so the argument would have to be something about people [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2898.7799999999997s)]
*  if so the question is [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2903.02s)]
*  How many people are killed from climate related events go look at a chart of it [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2905.18s)]
*  It is a chart of freefall just down down down down down. That's what the chart is because things are getting better not worse [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2910.22s)]
*  Um all the climate change it's all such nonsense hysteria [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2918.14s)]
*  And if you get rid of the electricity good luck combating the environment and having more humans survive [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2921.74s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No fossil fuels are [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2927.34s)]
*  Are life-saving devices they are literally [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2930.62s)]
*  Quite literally they save people's lives and if you're talking about, you know [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2935.02s)]
*  Whatever just be honest with what your proposed solution is banning fossil fuels [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2940.46s)]
*  Going carbon neutral or something like that. Okay, it's gonna kill tens of millions of people [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2945.66s)]
*  Huh burning your own turds [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2951.58s)]
*  Yeah, right. There you go. That'll make the environment much healthier. All right, let's keep lying [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2954.22s)]
*  Now we've proven we don't have to choose between protecting the environment [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2960.7s)]
*  And growing economy [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=2964.3s)]

*  I'm not like adding anything that he's not saying this is pretty remarkable and really should be part of joe biden's legacy that he invokes [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3076.64s)]

*  Seems to kind of imply that he was correct to be concerned about that six days six decades later. How's that doing? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3106.2400000000002s)]

*  Oh, no, no, you don't because you're their best friend, but no you're concerned now and by the way, just to be clear. I mean [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3121.0400000000004s)]
*  It should be said that [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3128.96s)]
*  It's kind of remarkable, I mean he doesn't mention him by name, but who has he been talking about this whole time [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3131.44s)]
*  It's clearly referring to elon musk, right? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3137.04s)]

*  Control being concentrated but here's the thing [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3144.96s)]

*  like [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3171.28s)]
*  Cop out that they get to say the problem is misinformation because you don't actually have a problem with misinformation [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3172.1600000000003s)]
*  look the first year and a half of joe biden's administration was the his [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3178.0s)]
*  Signature issue which he himself would have admitted was getting the vaccine in as many people's arms as he could [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3183.68s)]
*  And in order to get people to take the vaccine aside from look a lot of the ways that he wanted to force people [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3190.8799999999997s)]
*  He had that osha mandate [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3197.04s)]
*  Um was totally on unconstitutional and got struck down by the supreme court for being so blatantly unconstitutional [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3198.72s)]
*  That's not what osha is that's not what they're there to do. But [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3205.04s)]
*  How did he try to get people to take the vaccine by by blatantly saying [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3210.08s)]
*  That if you took the vaccine you couldn't get covet and you couldn't transmit covet [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3214.72s)]
*  And he's he doesn't seem too concerned about that misinformation [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3219.44s)]
*  It doesn't say right. Okay, so it's only [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3222.96s)]
*  Essentially what he's saying is information the regime doesn't like [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3225.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether it's true or not true and we all know that that was even zuckerberg himself [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3229.44s)]
*  Who was very guilty of enforcing these rules, but he himself has admitted that the biden administration wanted them to censor the truth [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3234.48s)]
*  It's not about whether the information is accurate or not his [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3242.56s)]
*  His final message to the american people where dwight d. Eisenhower's final message [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3246.32s)]
*  Think about this dwight d. Eisenhower the five-star general who led us to victory in world war two [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3251.2s)]
*  After his eight years of being president. He goes hey guys, we got a major problem here [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3257.44s)]
*  which is that [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3262.72s)]
*  We have now created the business of war [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3264.16s)]
*  And there's now this huge industry that will stands to have enormous gains [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3268.3199999999997s)]
*  If we fight wars and we got to work look out for that because man [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3275.6s)]
*  Incentives matter and if these people stand to make hundreds of billions of dollars off mass murder campaigns [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3280.14s)]
*  Then they might start pushing us toward mass murder campaigns [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3286.56s)]
*  Now these are my words not dwight eisenhower's and granted he said it slightly more eloquently than me [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3289.92s)]
*  But that was the message that he was giving okay [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3295.76s)]

*  and the american people [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3537.92s)]
*  To confront these powerful forces [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3539.7599999999998s)]
*  We must reform the tax code [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3542.48s)]
*  Not by giving the biggest tax cuts to billionaires, but by making them begin to pay their fair share [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3545.2s)]
*  We need to get dark money. That's that hidden funding behind too many campaigns contributions. We need to get it out of our politics [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3550.32s)]
*  We need to enact an 18 year time limit [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3558.48s)]
*  Term limit time in term for the strongest ethics and the strongest ethical reforms for supreme court [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3561.6800000000003s)]
*  We need to ban members of congress from trading from trading stock while they're in the congress [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3568.8s)]
*  We need to amend the constitution to make clear that no president [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3575.12s)]
*  No president is immune from crimes that he or she commits while in office [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3578.7200000000003s)]
*  President's power is not limit. It's not absolute. It shouldn't be [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3585.04s)]
*  No, no to mark amidst all the horse shit. I agree with his last two things people in congress [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3590.96s)]
*  Not be allowed to actually anyone in government probably shouldn't be allowed to trade stocks and uh, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3596.1600000000003s)]
*  I also think yes, uh, you should be allowed to be prosecuted for crimes that you've committed while president and uh, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3601.52s)]
*  Let's start with uh george bush and uh, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3607.52s)]
*  Or any wars actually I I think across the board wars are supposed to go through congress [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3610.4s)]
*  So any missions that have been done abroad, I guess all these guys are criminals. Let's go after [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3614.96s)]
*  Let's start let's start with joe biden like, okay, I mean look I it's not even that I disagree with what he said there [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3619.3599999999997s)]
*  But there is something um [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3625.68s)]
*  Mighty convenient about as you're leaving office in four days talking about how the president shouldn't have that much power [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3628.3999999999996s)]
*  You never said that through your four years. You're saying that on behalf of the next guy [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3637.8399999999997s)]
*  He shouldn't have that much power [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3643.2s)]
*  Yes, well after you lose and you know what I mean you get uh, um, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3645.2799999999997s)]
*  Just absolutely blown out by donald trump [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3649.9199999999996s)]
*  In turn their white house's internal polling showed donald trump was going to take 400 electoral votes against biden [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3653.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah at that point you go. Hey that guy who just cleaned my clock. He shouldn't have that much power [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3659.3599999999997s)]
*  Where was this when you were trying to pass your ocean mandate? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3664.3999999999996s)]
*  Are you trying to say that every single mid-size and above business? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3667.2s)]
*  Has to either vaccinate or fire their entire workforce whoever said the president has that power [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3671.52s)]
*  Since when does the president have the power to decide that businesses have to force a medical [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3678.0800000000004s)]
*  Intervention on their employees. Well, okay. The supreme court said it's wildly unconstitutional that you would even claim to have that power [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3684.94s)]
*  But you tried to so who exactly is joe biden to talk about the pre the power of the presidency [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3691.76s)]
*  He had absolutely no respect for it his entire time and and you know [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3698.4s)]
*  again, you could also [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3702.7200000000003s)]
*  include [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3704.48s)]
*  Joe biden's eight years as vice president into this under barack obama in which he launched wars [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3705.6000000000004s)]
*  in libya in syria in uh yemen in um, I guess somalia was going since w [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3712.88s)]
*  So, okay fine. He just continued that one where exactly does the constitution give the president the these war-making authorities? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3720.32s)]
*  You know you want to talk about yeah, the president isn't above the law. Okay [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3727.92s)]
*  Well, certainly I could make a case to prosecute joe biden [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3731.36s)]
*  But man is there a slam dunk case to prosecute barack obama barack obama murdered american citizens [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3734.5600000000004s)]
*  without charges [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3742.4s)]
*  Not only did they not not only did they not get their day in trial [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3744.88s)]
*  Not only was there not a conviction they were never charged with anything and he murdered american citizens [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3748.0s)]
*  so [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3754.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, i'm with you joe biden the president shouldn't have that type of power [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3755.28s)]
*  Maybe i'll take you a little bit more seriously when you address any of that [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3759.6000000000004s)]
*  but I digress because obviously [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3764.1600000000003s)]
*  The joe biden of today does not know that any of that happened and at one point maybe he did but I know [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3767.2000000000003s)]

*  You know [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3785.44s)]
*  um [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3786.6400000000003s)]
*  All right. Let's play one more a little bit and then we'll we'll wrap this up because I think people get the point [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3787.92s)]
*  Chrissy there's another danger that the concentration of power and wealth [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3793.84s)]
*  It erodes a sense of unity and common purpose [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3799.28s)]
*  It causes distrust and division [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3802.96s)]
*  Participating in our democracy becomes exhausting and even disillusioning and people don't feel like they have a fair shot [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3806.78s)]
*  We have to stay engaged in the process [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3815.36s)]
*  I know it's frustrating [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3818.0800000000004s)]
*  A fair shot is what makes america america [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3820.4s)]
*  Everyone's entitled to a fair shot not a guarantee, but just a fair shot and even playing field [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3823.6800000000003s)]

*  Only in america do we believe anything is possible [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3848.0s)]
*  Like a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in scranton, pennsylvania [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ34IlS16qc&t=3852.6400000000003s)]
