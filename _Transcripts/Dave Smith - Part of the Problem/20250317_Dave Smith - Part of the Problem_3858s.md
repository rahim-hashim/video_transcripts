# Dave Smith | Another Stupid War | Part Of The Problem 1243
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ)
*  What's up? What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the Fireburnstein. How are you good, sir? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=11.68s)]
*  I'm doing well, Davey Smith. How was battling everyone on Piers Morgan? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=15.72s)]
*  It was a well, you know, it wasn't too much of a battle this time, although I was on I [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=20.64s)]
*  was on the panel with three ladies, which I specifically request to never do. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=25.64s)]
*  But yet they still put me on there with a bunch of like talking politics with women. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=33.28s)]
*  It's just ridiculous. No, but so I think it was mostly it was mostly kind of like a three on one [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=38.24s)]
*  with Julia Rogowski. I think I'm saying her name right. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=47.08s)]
*  Being the one Democrat there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=50.88s)]
*  So I was on with Batcha and Riley Gaines, who was the the female the swimmer. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=54.6s)]
*  Yes, who became famous for opposing trans men competing with women or I'm sorry, trans women competing with. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=62.72s)]
*  What she's she opposed human beings with penises competing with human beings with vaginas. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=72.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, it's hard to remember all the terminology. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=79.16000000000001s)]
*  But it was an interesting panel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=82.84s)]
*  We talked about a few of the things that we will probably get into on today's show. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=85.48s)]
*  But yeah, that should be out. That should be out. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  So anyway, that's the reason we're starting a few minutes late before we get into the show quickly. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=91.72s)]
*  Do want to remind you that we're coming up on, I think, what is it? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  Less than two weeks until we're we're out in Boston, Boston, Massachusetts. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=99.28s)]
*  Very excited to get back out there to laugh. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=104.92s)]
*  Boston love. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=106.84s)]
*  I just love doing comedy in the city of Boston is one of the best comedy towns out there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=109.32s)]
*  And then Nashville, Chicago, San Diego, Appleton, Wisconsin, Salt Lake City, Denver, Cleveland, Providence, Tacoma, Spokane, Detroit, Tampa. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=113.72s)]
*  Whole lot of stuff coming up. Comic Dave Smith dot com for all of those ticket links. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=125.36s)]

*  I'm a few behind. We'll make them all up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=139.76000000000002s)]

*  Also, you get to be a part of the live chat, which I'll check in with in a little bit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  OK, on that note, if I can let everyone know, I did a run your mouth with Professor David Collum. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=147.96s)]
*  We threw some bombs. You should go check that one out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't do a lot of long, long form interviews. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=155.84s)]
*  And then I think April 5th and 6th, I'm in Steamboat, Colorado. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=157.96s)]
*  And the weekend before after that, doing the convention out in Idaho. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=161.4s)]
*  I got a new website up. It'll be probably up there by now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=166.08s)]
*  Rob Bernstein, comedy dot com has the dates. Come hang out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=168.52s)]
*  Hit me up to ski. Oh, yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=170.84s)]
*  Skiing and doing libertarian conventions with Rob Bernstein. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=173.12s)]
*  It's a that's not a fun time. I don't know what is. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=176.72000000000003s)]
*  All right. So let's let's let's open with talking about kind of what's going on in Yemen [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  and Donald Trump's recent threats to Iran. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=187.4s)]
*  I guess I would start. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  By saying this, OK, there are if you look at the position [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=195.28s)]
*  that Donald Trump is in right now, and I'm not trying to overplay it, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  you know, look like Donald Trump has put up his best approval numbers [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=207.16000000000003s)]
*  that he's had in both of his terms in pretty consistently in polling [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=211.0s)]
*  in the last few weeks since he's been president for the second time. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=216.52s)]
*  But it's you know, we're still talking about just above 50 percent. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  I think 53, 54 percent is about the highest that he's had to still. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=226.08s)]
*  It's not a president with 75 percent approval ratings, which, you know, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  I actually have lived through a couple of. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=234.56s)]
*  I don't know if in current the current divided landscape in America, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=237.52s)]
*  any president is going to get to be above 70 percent anytime soon. But. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=241.52s)]
*  Donald Trump is doing better than he was before. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm not trying to overplay it, but he's he's roughly popular [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=249.32s)]
*  with the the American voting base, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=253.12s)]
*  really more of the unique opportunity in the moment that Donald Trump [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=256.68s)]
*  and his had destroyed the Democrats are the approval ratings of the Democrats [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=260.28s)]
*  are in the toilet. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=264.64s)]
*  They've also what I think is the most devastating aspect is that they've [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=266.6s)]
*  lost their propaganda apparatus and the corporate media is just dead [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=271.08s)]
*  and dead in a way. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=275.76s)]
*  I mean, we may have said that years ago, but they're dead in a different type [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=277.0s)]
*  of way than they were back then. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=279.92s)]
*  In this moment, you have a lot of possibilities. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=283.88s)]
*  Donald Trump seems to, although he may himself only be slightly popular, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=287.16s)]
*  he has a few issues that are enormously popular [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=294.4s)]
*  that where he's really got a mandate, you know, things like lowering inflation, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=299.2s)]
*  lowering illegal immigration, turning the economy around. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=305.2s)]
*  I mean, these are issues that like he really has a lot of support [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=308.84s)]
*  behind his prescribed policies. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=313.24s)]
*  And now he's got like, you know, a thing that he never had in his first term, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=317.48s)]
*  which is that he got this kind of class of big tech billionaires [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=322.4s)]
*  who are totally behind him. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=328.0s)]
*  He really just never had anything like that before. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=330.2s)]
*  If you could think about Donald Trump's first administration, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=332.28s)]
*  Twitter was like his enemy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=334.72s)]
*  Now he's got the guy who owns Twitter in the White House. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=338.56s)]
*  If you were to ask yourself, as many people do, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=344.0s)]
*  what could possibly bring this down? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=347.44s)]
*  What could possibly lead to the Democrats making a comeback? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=351.72s)]
*  What could, you know, what could lose Donald Trump? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=355.12s)]
*  All of these gains that he's made so far. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=359.04s)]
*  The answer is so obviously [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  another catastrophic war, like just getting into another war [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=368.92s)]
*  that we absolutely don't need to be in. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=373.16s)]
*  And yet, despite this reality, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump and whoever the hell is in his administration, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  who he's listening to, seem to be getting him to push in that direction. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=382.68s)]
*  And then it is something it just like makes you want to pull your hair out. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  Watching it. The idea that we would even start. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=390.6s)]
*  And I'm not saying he's done that yet. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=395.0s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump is capable of doing these strikes here and there, just [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=396.68s)]
*  killing some people so we can all feel better or something like that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=402.08s)]
*  with with really no strategic point. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=405.6s)]
*  Do you think about his bombing campaigns in Syria in his first term? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=408.52s)]
*  But to to attack Yemen and then to start [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=414.2s)]
*  using this provocative language toward Iran, making more threats toward them. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=418.36s)]
*  It just seems like there is no positive that comes out of it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=422.88000000000005s)]
*  Again, other than maybe he gets to say, I'm the big, tough guy [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=427.6s)]
*  who murdered some people. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=431.36s)]
*  And the downside is just an endless pit of catastrophe [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=434.92s)]
*  that could ruin everything, every positive that he's already been able to implement. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  So I guess that's just like the first point I would make on [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=446.24s)]
*  this recent insane move to attack Yemen. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=450.36s)]
*  Any thoughts you want to jump in with? Go ahead, Rob. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  I think that that's all fair. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=458.0s)]
*  And what I would take the biggest issue with is just [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=460.64s)]
*  when we're out in the world and we're murdering in. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=464.16s)]
*  No. Sorry, did you? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=469.52s)]
*  I don't know if that was me or you, but you cut out there for a second. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=471.32s)]
*  Could you just just just say that line again? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=473.72s)]
*  We're out in the world is where I lost you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=475.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I just when we're out in the world and we're murdering innocent civilians, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=477.44000000000005s)]
*  I don't really see the distinction between us and terrorists. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=481.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, the distinction seems to be like, well, do you have a military? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  All right. If you have a military, then it's not terrorism. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  Or like if you're an ally of America, then it's not terrorism. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=493.48s)]
*  You know? Yeah, there's just to give like [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  a little bit of like a quick background [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=500.08s)]
*  on on this stuff, because it's a little interesting that, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=504.2s)]
*  you know, as you know well, Rob, because you've been with me for [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=508.12s)]
*  for years at this point. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=511.96s)]
*  The Yemen was an issue that really our camp [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=515.04s)]
*  was amongst the only groups [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=519.72s)]
*  caring about or talking about this for many years. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=523.12s)]
*  Through the it was from the the end of the Obama [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=526.64s)]
*  administration through the entire Trump administration into the beginning of [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=530.0s)]
*  the Joe Biden administration. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=534.48s)]
*  And in fact, when the Mises caucus took over the Libertarian Party, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=536.08s)]
*  this was like the first big initiative that we launched. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=538.76s)]
*  Was this like calling your congressman campaign to get [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=541.28s)]
*  an end to the war in Yemen? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=546.6s)]
*  And it wasn't really until after October. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=548.88s)]
*  By the way, I shouldn't say it's not just the antiwar Libertarians. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=552.64s)]
*  There were like some small groups of good antiwar leftists. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=555.36s)]
*  They're like the Code Pink and the Quakers for Peace and people like that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=558.72s)]
*  who talked a lot about the the just [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=563.08s)]
*  humanitarian nightmare that was in Ukraine for many years. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=566.76s)]
*  And but anyway, it wasn't really until after October 7th [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=572.24s)]
*  when the Houthis started kind of fighting back [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=575.84s)]
*  and sticking up for the Palestinians, that the world started talking [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=579.44s)]
*  a lot about the Houthis in Yemen and how horrible they are. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=583.08s)]
*  And oh, my God, they're attacking, you know, American cargo ships or whatever. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=586.28s)]
*  But just so people know, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=591.6s)]
*  this really goes back to the beginning of the Obama administration. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=593.9599999999999s)]
*  And in 2009, when Obama first became president, he [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=598.52s)]
*  launched like a CIA drone war in Yemen. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  And it was pretty much it was essentially, I think, one of the only [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=609.0s)]
*  theaters in the war on terrorism, where [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=614.52s)]
*  the actual goal seemed to be a war on terrorism. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=619.16s)]
*  You know, like at this point in Afghanistan, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=622.36s)]
*  we were fighting against the Taliban and working on a regime change war there. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=626.28s)]
*  We had already driven al Qaeda out, like we weren't like fighting al Qaeda [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=631.36s)]
*  really much anymore in Afghanistan. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  And while there may have been some al Qaeda guys in the insurgency [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=637.28s)]
*  in Iraq, we were really there, you know, fighting [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=642.0400000000001s)]
*  to prop up the Shiite democracy that we had installed. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=647.64s)]
*  And, you know, in Libya, well, which I guess was came a year later [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=652.44s)]
*  or two years later, we were there to overthrow the Gaddafi regime, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=657.24s)]
*  had absolutely nothing to do with with the war on terrorism. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=662.0s)]
*  And in fact, we were on the side of the bin Ladenites when we were doing that. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=665.76s)]
*  In Syria, we were on the side of the bin Ladenites [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=670.04s)]
*  when we were trying to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=672.88s)]
*  But in Yemen, at least in 2009, and really, I think up until around 2015, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=675.0s)]
*  that did seem that was the mission. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=681.68s)]
*  We were drone bombing a QIP in in in Syria. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=683.48s)]
*  Now, throughout that time, and it's pretty well documented [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=688.24s)]
*  al Qaeda, a QIP, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=693.16s)]
*  They they grew in number. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=697.24s)]
*  And, you know, for the same typical reasons that this always happens, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=700.52s)]
*  it's General McChrystal's insurgent math. Right. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=703.64s)]
*  This was his famous 10 minus two equals 20. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=707.52s)]
*  You know, you have some targeted strike, which is we like to think of them [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=710.64s)]
*  as like these targeted strikes. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=714.84s)]
*  But, you know, when you're on the ground, these are strikes that end up killing. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think there was at one point, there had been a major study [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=721.08s)]
*  on Obama's drone war specifically, where the number they came out with was [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=724.36s)]
*  96 percent of the people killed in the strikes were innocent people. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=728.5999999999999s)]
*  And when you say innocent people, meaning they weren't the target [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  of the person who was on the list, sometimes also the person on the list [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  was wrong because it's not like, oh, you've had a fair trial for all these people [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=740.8399999999999s)]
*  and you figured out who are the terrorists and who are not the terrorists. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=743.88s)]
*  You know, it's but even by their own list, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=746.56s)]
*  just assuming everyone on the list is guilty, if you want to something like 95, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=749.16s)]
*  96 percent of the people killed weren't that. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=753.4s)]
*  And so every time you'd have one of these strikes, you know, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=755.88s)]
*  you kill three little girls and then all of their brothers and uncles [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=759.4399999999999s)]
*  and fathers and all of these guys join up with Al Qaeda because now they are, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=764.4s)]
*  you know, radicalized to want to fight against America. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=768.56s)]
*  So it's a completely counterproductive and evil fucked up, you know, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=771.92s)]
*  drone bombing campaign for most of Obama's presidency. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=778.16s)]
*  Now, just to keep in mind here, Yemen at that point already [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=782.04s)]
*  was the poorest country in the Middle East. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=786.5999999999999s)]
*  They're just murdering innocent people in the poorest country in a poor area. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  It's just, you know, whatever. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=794.68s)]
*  Not to offend my my debate [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=797.56s)]
*  competitor, Josh Hammer, but, you know, you do tend to get caught up [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=801.88s)]
*  in the morality of that a little bit like Jesus, just murdering poor people [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  in the poorest country in the Middle East sounds pretty fucked up. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=810.56s)]
*  But where it really got bad was after that. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=813.28s)]
*  And essentially like the the Obama administration [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=816.4799999999999s)]
*  was propping up the dictator in Yemen at the time and using him for all types [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  of like like secret torture and shit like that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=826.2399999999999s)]
*  And eventually then he even though he was a Shiite, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=829.76s)]
*  he was at odds with the Houthis at one point. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=834.88s)]
*  And then they later on, they ended up like joining up and kind of being [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=837.88s)]
*  on the same side when the Saudis and the Americans tried to get his second [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=841.68s)]
*  in command to take over for him. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=845.88s)]
*  And the Houthis ended up gaining more and more strength. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=847.68s)]
*  And they they started taking over more and more territory in the area. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=850.7199999999999s)]
*  And the Saudis did not like this at all. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=854.52s)]
*  The Saudis are enemies with the Houthis. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=856.4s)]
*  And the Saudis were really upset at America. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  And they they were upset at America at this point. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=861.64s)]
*  Or this is we're getting into like late 2014, early 2015. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=865.36s)]
*  They were upset at the Americans because, number one, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=869.7199999999999s)]
*  they were furious about the war in Iraq still. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=873.04s)]
*  You know, if you remember, the Saudis were really our allies in the region [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=875.24s)]
*  who opposed the war in Iraq the whole time. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=878.76s)]
*  But, you know, the neocons wanted it and Israel wanted it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=881.0s)]
*  And so they won out and they got this regime change. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=885.16s)]
*  The Saudis were furious because, of course, the Saudis, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=887.7199999999999s)]
*  who are our Sunni sock puppet state in the region, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=890.92s)]
*  their big enemy is Iran, the Shiites. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=893.9599999999999s)]
*  And so they didn't care much for the idea that we would take out Saddam [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=896.88s)]
*  Hussein and then hand this majority Shiite country [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=900.0799999999999s)]
*  their influence over to Iran like this. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=903.3599999999999s)]
*  This hurt them in the region. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=905.8399999999999s)]
*  So they were very upset about it. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=907.3599999999999s)]
*  And then Obama turned around and made the deal with Iran. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=908.5999999999999s)]
*  And so they were so. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=913.9599999999999s)]
*  And again, you can Google these words and the several [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=915.3199999999999s)]
*  really good articles will come up if you just Google Obama [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=918.5999999999999s)]
*  placate the Saudis, because this is what Obama officials said [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=922.24s)]
*  was the reason that Barack Obama backed the Saudi invasion in 2015. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=927.0s)]
*  Now, the. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=934.2s)]
*  Just to be clear, if you Google that, the articles that are going to pop up, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=938.12s)]
*  I'm not sending you to like read Dave DeKamp over at antiwar.com [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=942.32s)]
*  or to read Scott Horton or to read Ron Paul. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=946.2s)]
*  I'm saying like there's articles from the Council on Foreign Relations, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=948.5200000000001s)]
*  the New York Times, Reuters, the Associated Press, like all of the like [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=951.4s)]
*  this placate the Saudis. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=955.4s)]
*  This was the official justification for why Barack Obama launched [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=956.9599999999999s)]
*  what turned into a war of genocide, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=962.04s)]
*  because we had to placate the Saudis like the worst violators [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=965.6s)]
*  of human rights in the region, which is really saying something. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=969.9599999999999s)]
*  We had to placate them because like, sorry, we did that other war [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  you didn't like, and then we made a [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=976.4399999999999s)]
*  nuclear inspections deal that you didn't like. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=979.12s)]
*  So we'll help you launch a war against the poorest country in the Middle East [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=981.12s)]
*  for no reason, for no no discernible reason that helps Americans. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=986.16s)]
*  And just to be clear, I mean, what the Saudis did in Yemen was [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=990.76s)]
*  every bit as brutal, if not more than what Israel's doing in Gaza right now. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=996.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, maybe there's a smarter person than me who's really done [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1003.0s)]
*  like some academic papers on this to sit down. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1005.5999999999999s)]
*  But I mean, it was every bit. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1008.16s)]
*  I think it was even worse because like, I think the total number of people [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1009.36s)]
*  who died was even worse. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1012.96s)]
*  And I think just the fact that it was Saudi Arabia conducting the war [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1014.12s)]
*  just there just wasn't the type of pressure on them [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1019.68s)]
*  that there is on a first world country to be like, yeah, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1023.04s)]
*  you can't get away with that, you know, like even Israel, you know, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1026.16s)]
*  has to slow down on shooting the aid workers after a few weeks of bad press. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1029.44s)]
*  But the Saudis, again, with the help of the of the US Army, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1034.88s)]
*  I mean, for years, we were like refueling their fighter jets mid [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1040.16s)]
*  path because they can't do it themselves. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1044.2s)]
*  And they had help from our Navy to put a full blockade around the country. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1046.24s)]
*  And people died by the hundreds of thousands in the most brutal way. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1050.24s)]
*  And the Saudis were also caught several times like barming [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1054.3600000000001s)]
*  barming farms, barming sewage plants, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1058.64s)]
*  barming irrigation sites, like like just a war on the civilian population. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1062.0s)]
*  And so in this whole thing, I mean, like I know you read a bit about this [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  during the time, Rob, because we talk about this all the time. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1073.12s)]
*  There were like outbreaks of cholera where there just hundreds of thousands [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1075.28s)]
*  of people got them. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1079.52s)]
*  And of course, cholera particularly ends up killing babies and old people [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1080.6799999999998s)]
*  and can be cured with like liquids. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1084.72s)]
*  Like, I'm not sure. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1088.36s)]
*  I don't even think you need antibiotics. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1090.12s)]
*  I think like you you need like like Gatorade or whatever. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1091.76s)]
*  But so there's just babies like vomiting themselves to death. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1095.6s)]
*  It just it was the worst humanitarian crisis in the world for many years. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1100.4s)]
*  I think at least from like 2015 through 2021, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1105.16s)]
*  it was the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1110.8s)]
*  And through all of this, the Houthis remained in power. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1113.36s)]
*  And I think they even just took over more control of the country. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1117.72s)]
*  And they simply outlasted the Saudis and won. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1120.84s)]
*  And then they'd be able to hit back a little bit like they had like some drones [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1123.96s)]
*  that could strike some oil sites in Saudi Arabia. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1127.8s)]
*  And eventually, like the Saudis just tired of it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1131.24s)]
*  And they were like, we can't beat them. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1133.84s)]
*  And they threw in the towel. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1135.1200000000001s)]
*  And it was early in the Biden administration [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1136.3600000000001s)]
*  that the Saudis just kind of quit doing it. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1139.16s)]
*  And so just to keep in mind here and part of the reason why I say this is like, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1141.32s)]
*  I think it's almost everybody talking about the story today, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1146.72s)]
*  like kind of leaves out all that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1150.52s)]
*  It's just like you're supposed to in the same sense that like October 7th [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1152.76s)]
*  is supposed to be viewed in a vacuum. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1156.6399999999999s)]
*  Like here was the nice little Jewish boys just in there. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1158.68s)]
*  We were just trying to have a rave outside your concentration camp, you know, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1162.0s)]
*  and then out of nowhere this happened. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1165.84s)]
*  But like, no, there's actually a history and there's these things happen in context. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1167.92s)]
*  And OK, so all of that happened. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1172.8s)]
*  But I also say it not just to understand [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1176.4s)]
*  that there's the history of all of this, but I say it just to make the point [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1178.8799999999999s)]
*  that like the Houthis went through all of that [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1182.72s)]
*  and are still in control and are still trying to fight back. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1186.56s)]
*  Now, many people, myself included, might say, Jesus, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1190.36s)]
*  why the hell are you guys doing this? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1194.56s)]
*  Like, haven't your people been through enough that you're going to bring more of this on them? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1196.12s)]
*  But that's not really the point. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1201.0s)]
*  The point is that an entire blockade and a brutal bombing campaign for eight years [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1202.44s)]
*  wasn't enough to take these guys out of power or to slow them down. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1207.8s)]
*  And what we think dropping a couple of tomahawks is going to do it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1212.32s)]
*  No, it's going to do nothing except kill people. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1215.76s)]
*  We're just like unless we were actually committed. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1218.3999999999999s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1221.44s)]
*  If the US military, if we wanted to invade Yemen the way we invaded Iraq. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1222.28s)]
*  OK, we could probably overthrow the Houthis. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1227.12s)]
*  But if we're not talking about doing that, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1230.84s)]
*  we're just talking about murdering some people so we can feel good about ourselves. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1233.04s)]
*  So that's kind of like the now after October 7th. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1238.88s)]
*  They did start like attacking ships, you know, and they were like, hey, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1244.12s)]
*  we're on behalf of these poor Palestinians. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1250.08s)]
*  We're going to not let Israeli ships go through here and also some American ships. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1253.64s)]
*  And, you know, you can feel about that however you feel about that. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1258.12s)]
*  But I would just point out that during the ceasefire, there were no Houthi attacks. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1261.72s)]
*  And it wasn't until the ceasefire broke down that they started doing it again. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1266.6000000000001s)]
*  And so to me, it does kind of lead to some of these questions. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1270.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, I know a lot of the like pro-Israel conservative types, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1274.44s)]
*  while they love to lecture you about moral relativism on every other front. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1279.92s)]
*  When it comes to this, you're never allowed to say like, OK, I mean, look, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1284.52s)]
*  it's probably not great that the Houthis are attacking ships. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1289.6s)]
*  But at the same time, why? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1293.04s)]
*  Does no one have a right to stand up for the Palestinians at all? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1297.52s)]
*  You know, I mean, Israel gets attacked on October 7th and they get to do this. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1301.6s)]
*  And yet the Palestinians have to endure all of this. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1307.32s)]
*  And no one has a right to like close down some shipping lanes or something. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1309.84s)]
*  Again, I wouldn't say no one has a right to do it, but it's just like. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1313.1599999999999s)]
*  Any look, I guess it's just very clear. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1316.48s)]
*  It's like, oh, so this is another cost associated [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1319.36s)]
*  with supporting Israel's slaughter of Palestinians. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1322.84s)]
*  So now we now also have to write, which is like the whole story [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1326.8s)]
*  of US foreign policy, always we now have to once again, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1330.96s)]
*  we have to take on Israel's problems and make them our own. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1336.72s)]
*  Now we're in this beef, which is so clearly has nothing to do with us. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1341.16s)]
*  And has to do with what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1346.28s)]
*  which is objectively horrific. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1350.12s)]
*  But now because we're the ones funding that and arming that [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1353.04s)]
*  and giving it diplomatic cover, we now find ourselves in yet another conflict. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1356.04s)]
*  The last thing that this country needs and one of the things [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1360.8s)]
*  that Donald Trump ran and won on twice was the idea [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1365.4399999999998s)]
*  that we don't need more conflicts like this. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1369.24s)]
*  And then, of course, we're right back in another one. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1371.48s)]
*  So I guess that would be I mean, I know it's just a bit of a rant, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1374.04s)]
*  but I think it's kind of like it's worth it to get that out there. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1378.16s)]
*  But I just can't I can't overstate how horrible a decision [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1381.72s)]
*  this is by Donald Trump and how. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1385.24s)]
*  How much it's like the you know, it's like people would say for a while, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1389.68s)]
*  they'd be like, oh, stop bitching about all his bad appointments. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1392.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like focus on the good ones or something. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  It's like, now this is what happens when you surround yourself [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1397.88s)]
*  with a bunch of war hawks who are giving you bad information. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1400.2s)]
*  So I don't know any thoughts on any of that, Rob, feel free to jump in. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1402.92s)]
*  I hadn't quite considered, I guess, the Houthi Palestine tie in [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1407.8s)]
*  and that this was in response to to what was going on over there. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1413.48s)]
*  I guess I was more just looking at it from the why are we now [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1417.28s)]
*  in the business of killing innocent civilians? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1420.72s)]
*  And I just find it surprising that if there's these [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1423.72s)]
*  these multi-billion dollar trade routes and it's important to [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1427.8s)]
*  multiple countries that there's not a way of securing the trade route. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1434.04s)]
*  I mean, if you're telling me that we're both aligned with China [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1438.0s)]
*  and nearly every country in the world about keeping this trade route open, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1440.92s)]
*  there's really no way of just sending a bunch of ships in there, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1444.88s)]
*  a bunch of submarines in there and maintaining the trade route [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1447.56s)]
*  without having to bomb areas of Yemen that include killing civilians. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1450.44s)]
*  It just and and speaking to your point of [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1454.32s)]
*  what is this actually accomplished? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1457.3200000000002s)]
*  So are we starting a war with Yemen? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1458.76s)]
*  Are we just it seems like the strongman shit of, hey, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1460.6000000000001s)]
*  we're going to bomb innocent civilians in your territories [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1463.76s)]
*  and maybe take out a couple of leaders here and there [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1466.3200000000002s)]
*  until you actually acquiesce and give up. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1468.6000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't seem to work. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1470.6000000000001s)]
*  Or I don't know, where's the example of that working so far? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1472.4s)]
*  Or like, is is there ever a point [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1475.88s)]
*  where we don't have to just kill innocent people to make this like? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1478.8400000000001s)]
*  Is there ever a point where like we've killed enough innocent people [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1483.0800000000002s)]
*  that it's like, I think they got the message. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1486.16s)]
*  I think they realize that we're willing to do this. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1488.0800000000002s)]
*  It's always just this like, no, we got to show toughness. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1490.16s)]
*  We got to let them know. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1492.96s)]
*  But again, you know, to my to my major point here, look, the idea again, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1494.0400000000002s)]
*  Yemen, which was all had started as the poorest country in the Middle East [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1500.1200000000001s)]
*  at the beginning of this before going through the worst [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1505.8000000000002s)]
*  humanitarian crisis in the world for many years. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1508.24s)]
*  They went through all of that and then still stuck up for the Palestinians. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1511.1200000000001s)]
*  When Israel started its assault on Gaza. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1516.16s)]
*  And you think like a couple of Tomahawk missiles are going to change that calculation? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1519.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I don't think there's any serious person even in D.C. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1523.28s)]
*  who believes that, like, all right, they got the message. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1527.28s)]
*  Like they needed to be smacked around and now they won't mess with our ships anymore. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1530.64s)]
*  And I think I just read the just earlier today that they vowed [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1534.72s)]
*  to continue or something like that. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1537.72s)]
*  It's like, yeah, of course, of course they did. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1539.28s)]
*  Like, this isn't going to stop them. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1541.72s)]
*  So what on earth is the point? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  Why? Why would we be doing this? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1545.72s)]
*  And again, it's like with all of these [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1548.04s)]
*  with all of these scenarios, every single war, they can never [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1553.28s)]
*  whether whether we're talking about Iraq, Afghanistan, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1559.72s)]
*  whether we're talking about Libya or Syria, whether we're talking about Yemen, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1563.04s)]
*  whether we're talking about Somalia, if you're talking about Ukraine, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1568.04s)]
*  if you're talking about Israel's war in Gaza, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1571.04s)]
*  nobody can ever clearly articulate why we're taking this action, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1573.2s)]
*  what the end game is and what our strategy is to go pursue that end game. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1578.1200000000001s)]
*  And like where it's like a reasonable end game. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1582.72s)]
*  Whenever they give you an answer to that, Rob, it's something like, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1585.48s)]
*  we're going to drive Putin out of Crimea. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1588.52s)]
*  OK, yeah, but that can't ever happen. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1591.24s)]
*  Or democracy is going to sweep the region. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1592.88s)]
*  Or like it's always these goals that are just like on their face. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1594.8000000000002s)]
*  You're like, yeah, but that's completely unachievable. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1597.6000000000001s)]
*  There is no chance. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1599.6000000000001s)]
*  There is a zero percent chance that you will achieve that goal. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1600.6399999999999s)]
*  But it's never just kind of like, OK, so we dropped this. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1603.4399999999998s)]
*  OK, so we killed whatever. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1606.9199999999998s)]
*  I think it was 53 people we killed in this last strike. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1608.12s)]
*  OK, and we had to do that because why? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1611.1599999999999s)]
*  What's the next step after this? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1614.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I guess the next step is that Trump threatens Iran [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1616.52s)]
*  and says that they're going to they'll be devastating consequences [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1620.48s)]
*  and that they are responsible for what the Houthis do. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1623.7199999999998s)]
*  Which is like just doesn't even make any sense at all. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1627.84s)]
*  I mean, you would only I mean, don't get me wrong. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1630.84s)]
*  I understand why it makes sense to the insane [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1633.32s)]
*  neoconservatives and the insane Likudniks and the insane, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1636.9199999999998s)]
*  you know, like evangelical Christians who think that like protecting, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1641.32s)]
*  you know, the Jews in Israel is what's going to bring Jesus Christ back [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1646.3999999999999s)]
*  or the insane like Jewish supremacists [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1649.36s)]
*  who think that everything should be run around what, you know, the state of Israel. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1652.56s)]
*  OK, I get there because they just want to topple the government in Iran. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1656.48s)]
*  That's why they all support it, because they just want to move closer [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1659.64s)]
*  to the regime change that they've always really wanted, which is the one in Tehran. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1662.96s)]
*  OK, so that's why they support it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1666.88s)]
*  But short of that, if you weren't trying to get us [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1669.3600000000001s)]
*  into another catastrophic war in the Middle East, like if you didn't hate [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1672.48s)]
*  the United States of America and want to see this country's destruction, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1676.16s)]
*  then why would it make any sense to start saying that Iran [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1679.92s)]
*  is responsible for anything the Houthis do? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1684.28s)]
*  Then nobody really believes that the Iranians have complete [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1687.16s)]
*  puppet like control over the Houthis and they can decide [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1691.2s)]
*  what they're going to do or what they're not going to do. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1694.6s)]
*  I mean, like, imagine if you were to take that that line [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1696.8799999999999s)]
*  with any with the United States of America ever. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1700.44s)]
*  You were to say, OK, well, you guys, you know, the we we [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1703.72s)]
*  our government props up the Saudis and the [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1708.52s)]
*  the Jordanians and the Egyptians and the Israelis and the Ukrainians [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1714.12s)]
*  and all the all the governments that we fund and contribute to. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1719.12s)]
*  If we were to say we are now responsible, you know, in the Saudis, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1723.9199999999998s)]
*  you know, murdered that Khashoggi murdered that journalist guy [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1728.12s)]
*  and cut him up or whatever that you say, I hold Joe Biden responsible for that. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1732.12s)]
*  That's not like why the only reason why you would even start thinking like that [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1737.84s)]
*  is if you were trying to bring America into a wider war, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1741.76s)]
*  which has always been the huge risk since October 7th [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1745.48s)]
*  and since the decision to start, you know, backing Israel's assault on Gaza. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1749.72s)]
*  This has always been the biggest risk. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1754.0s)]
*  And now it's like Donald Trump is just it's he's walking into this trap [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1755.84s)]
*  and seems to be willingly doing it. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1760.6s)]
*  So, you know, there's been there certainly has been some positives [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1762.84s)]
*  of the Trump administration so far. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1768.44s)]
*  But man, is he flirting with throwing all of that away, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1770.1200000000001s)]
*  all of that away right now. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1773.92s)]
*  And then even just aside from, you know, the [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1775.24s)]
*  aside from the kind of potential disasters that could come out of this. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1780.24s)]
*  Yeah, you know, just this in itself, just killing a bunch of innocent people. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1785.52s)]
*  I mean, I know this is the United States of America, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1790.2s)]
*  and we've gotten so used to that, like that's just part of what our government does. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1792.04s)]
*  But isn't it something that the government can just like take an action [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1795.8000000000002s)]
*  that's going to kill, including several children reportedly [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1800.5600000000002s)]
*  were killed in these strikes and like we're. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1803.88s)]
*  It's just I don't know. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1808.3600000000001s)]
*  It's so crazy to me that [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1809.1200000000001s)]
*  that murdering children wouldn't be something that collectively, as a society, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1812.4s)]
*  we go like, well, man, I mean, if you ever have to do that, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1818.64s)]
*  then there's a serious process that we go through. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1822.0400000000002s)]
*  And that process involves [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1825.3200000000002s)]
*  laying out the case of why you absolutely have no other choice but to do this. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1827.16s)]
*  But now Donald Trump just decides. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1832.0400000000002s)]
*  Then isn't it interesting, you know, Darrell Cooper had a great [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1834.4s)]
*  a great post about this the other day. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1838.28s)]
*  But isn't it interesting, right, that there's no judge. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1840.24s)]
*  There's no congressman. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1846.48s)]
*  There's no cable news show host [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1849.64s)]
*  that will ever even dream of like making this the issue. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1852.76s)]
*  You know, like, whoa, you're the president is just like [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1858.8s)]
*  committing an act of war. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1863.2s)]
*  He doesn't have to consult anybody but like his donors or something like that. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1864.56s)]
*  He doesn't even have to talk to anybody in Congress. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1869.1200000000001s)]
*  He doesn't, you know, when you hear all this stuff about like [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1871.84s)]
*  Elon Musk is auditing USAID. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1874.16s)]
*  This is outside, you know, this is anti-democratic. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1877.48s)]
*  He doesn't have the authority to do that. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1880.76s)]
*  But yet, when it comes to making war. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1882.64s)]
*  Just crickets, you know, even like the Democrats who are always talking [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1886.64s)]
*  about Trump is Hitler and he's this and that, and he's an authoritarian [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1891.32s)]
*  end of democracy, no one really cares when it's just murdering kids. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1894.76s)]
*  There's something so profoundly sick and backward about all of that. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1900.16s)]
*  And I don't no matter how much it happens, that will never be normal to me. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1905.72s)]
*  I'll never get used to that and just go like, yeah, well, I mean, you know, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1910.64s)]
*  on there were little brown kids in a third world country. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1914.48s)]
*  I mean, who cares? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1918.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, like, yeah, I don't know. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1919.1200000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1921.3200000000002s)]
*  I still think that's profoundly horrible. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1921.96s)]
*  Just an awful thing to do. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1924.3200000000002s)]
*  And especially when you're doing it, like with no, no clear cut reason as to why [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1926.1200000000001s)]
*  this absolutely had to be done. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1932.48s)]
*  Then to your point that you made before, I mean, it just like, I'm sorry. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1934.6000000000001s)]
*  There's just, there, there are, there are other ways to protect shipping lanes [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1938.1200000000001s)]
*  other than just constantly being in a state of slaughtering innocent people. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1943.96s)]
*  I just don't believe otherwise. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1947.68s)]
*  By the way, just the money we spend on the bombs, you know, we could, we could [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1950.6000000000001s)]
*  probably just pay off people to be able to ship for, for less money. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1955.28s)]
*  So it's all just terrible. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1960.32s)]
*  And, um, you know, again, it's not, it's, it's nothing that any of us should [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1962.2s)]
*  really be shocked by. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1966.04s)]
*  I mean, this is Donald Trump, you know, Donald Trump, he backed the Saudi war [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1967.36s)]
*  against the people of Yemen for every single day of his first term. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1972.7199999999998s)]
*  So I don't think he's going to be moved over like some innocent people in Yemen. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1976.76s)]
*  Got killed. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1980.4799999999998s)]
*  I mean, he seems to be quite comfortable doing it. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1981.36s)]
*  And, uh, yeah, anyway, we will see, we will see where all of this goes. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1984.1599999999999s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1989.4799999999998s)]
*  which is Crowd Health, a company I've been telling you about for years. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1993.6399999999999s)]
*  They are amazing. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1997.6799999999998s)]
*  They are a decentralized healthcare payment system that frees you from the [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=1998.6s)]
*  tyranny of health insurance. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2003.0s)]
*  If I were to ask, if I were to survey a hundred people and ask a hundred of them, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2004.84s)]
*  Hey, on a scale of one to 10, how much do you love your health insurance company? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2009.08s)]
*  I highly doubt I would get a single 10 because nobody is happy with health [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2014.0s)]
*  insurance, the system is broken. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2018.72s)]
*  The companies are broken. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2020.72s)]
*  There's a lot of problems with them, largely the government intervention, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2022.1599999999999s)]
*  but now there is truly an alternative to health insurance. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2025.8s)]
*  And that is Crowd Health. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2029.48s)]
*  It's significantly less expensive than health insurance. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2030.92s)]
*  It rips out the bureaucracy of the middleman. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2033.92s)]
*  Some say is upward of 40% of the costs. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2036.48s)]
*  Plus the people who have joined Crowd Health take personal responsibility [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2039.1599999999999s)]
*  over their healthcare. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2043.48s)]
*  That means they take care of themselves. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2044.6399999999999s)]
*  Singles are just $185 a month. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2047.24s)]
*  A family of four is $605 a month. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2049.84s)]
*  And if you use the promo code P OTP, you can get $99 a month per person [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2053.04s)]

*  alternative, check out Crowd Health. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2064.88s)]
*  Crowd Health is not health insurance. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2067.04s)]
*  It's a totally different way of paying for healthcare. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2068.92s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2083.64s)]
*  All right, let's let's switch gears a little bit because the other big story [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2086.68s)]
*  that I do just find fascinating and this is what we were arguing about on [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2091.7999999999997s)]
*  Pierce Morgan today is this this auto pen claim that Donald Trump is making. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2095.84s)]
*  I I'll let you you go first on this, Rob, because I've ranted a lot on the [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2105.44s)]
*  first topic, but I find this fascinating in a lot of ways. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2110.44s)]
*  What are your thoughts on this claim by Donald Trump? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2113.44s)]
*  First, at least maybe like lay out what it is and then give your thoughts on [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2115.56s)]
*  this this claim about the Joe Biden pardons. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2119.2400000000002s)]
*  All right. Well, the claim is we all know that Joe Biden had dementia. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2123.32s)]
*  We were all been yelling who was actually running the White House, especially in [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2127.08s)]
*  the last two years that he was there. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2131.44s)]
*  And on the way out, Joe Biden gave a number of preemptive pardons, which is [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2133.7200000000003s)]
*  rare, it included Liz Cheney and others that were on the January 6th panel. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2137.8s)]
*  And then, of course, to his own family member, Hunter Biden, among amongst some [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2142.2000000000003s)]
*  others, but I think those are all of the oh, yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2147.2000000000003s)]
*  And then Fauci also got a preemptive pardon. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2149.6800000000003s)]
*  It was later discovered presidents make wide use of an auto pen and don't [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2152.28s)]
*  frequently actually sign documents. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2157.1600000000003s)]
*  Now, the oddity in Joe Biden using the auto pen is that it seems that his [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2159.76s)]
*  when he dropped out of the race, that that letter was actually signed by him, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2164.6s)]
*  whereas everything else was seemingly signed by the auto pen. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2168.92s)]
*  Now, the question being put forward is, was Joe Biden even aware that the auto [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2172.52s)]
*  pen was in use? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2177.16s)]
*  Did someone else just put make these documents and sign them? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2178.76s)]
*  Or if he was in a state of dementia, was he actually aware of the usage of them? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2181.92s)]
*  And if a automatic auto pen is being used by the White House and it's not actually [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2185.8399999999997s)]
*  being used by a president or a president that's aware, should that stand? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2190.6s)]
*  So that's the background of the story. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2194.2799999999997s)]
*  Now, my guess is this is a fun little shit storm from Donald Trump. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2197.08s)]
*  And I absolutely think that amongst the things that should be happening is the [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2201.8399999999997s)]
*  last administration should be investigated, specifically Fauci and whether or not [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2205.2s)]
*  there was a criminal behavior that took part, took place in fraud in selling the [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2209.88s)]
*  covid vaccines and acquiring that virus from China. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2214.68s)]
*  I'll put it in those terms. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  And then as to whether or not Liz Cheney or others, that one's a little bit more of [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2219.7599999999998s)]
*  potentially a political witch hunt and the losing game of administrations going [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2225.24s)]
*  after previous administrations. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2229.12s)]
*  But fine, maybe they play dirty first. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2230.96s)]
*  And so it would make sense to expose the deep state working against Donald Trump's [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2232.7999999999997s)]
*  best interest. I'm all for going after the previous administration specifically for [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2236.8799999999997s)]
*  illegal behavior and specifically on the Fauci category. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2242.6s)]
*  Or if you can prove financial crimes by the Biden family that are close to [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2246.24s)]
*  treasonous, I'm all for it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2251.44s)]
*  I think proving that Joe Biden's awareness about the usage of the auto pen sounds [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2254.08s)]
*  like a difficult legal uphill battle because what are you going to do? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2260.2s)]
*  Bring him into court now? I don't know. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2263.36s)]
*  Well, how do I know when he did or didn't know? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2265.52s)]
*  How do I know when he lost his agency? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2267.92s)]
*  Is there someone who's going to actually testify against the administration that he [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2269.8799999999997s)]
*  specifically didn't know about the usage of the auto pen? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2273.9199999999996s)]
*  So to me, specifically the auto pen thing is a fun little shitstorm of a storyline. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2276.6s)]
*  And right now, Donald Trump probably needs bigger wins than actually just going after [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2281.64s)]
*  the old administration. I think the public is not that interested in prosecuting Biden [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2285.64s)]
*  as much as they're interested in knowing that tariffs aren't going to ruin our economy [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2290.6s)]
*  or that we're not going to be in World War Three with Europe. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2294.56s)]
*  I think people are a little bit more interested in actually Donald Trump enacting [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2296.2s)]
*  his agenda versus cleansing the old administration for what we voted out because it was [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2299.68s)]
*  terrible. But this is this a fun shitstorm. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2304.04s)]
*  I'm all for investigating specifically Fauci's top of my list and get your prosecute [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2307.0s)]
*  Fauci t-shirts. So it's top of my list of what I think we need to do to cleanse the [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2310.8799999999997s)]
*  country. I can't imagine that this holds up in court of that he's actually able to [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2315.04s)]
*  undo it because we can't prove that Biden knew that it was happening. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2320.12s)]
*  Yeah, OK. So, yeah, I can't really disagree with anything you said there. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2324.12s)]
*  I think that's that's exactly right. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2328.16s)]
*  It does seem particularly given the fact that I think a lot of presidents use the [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2330.3199999999997s)]
*  auto pen, including Donald Trump. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2334.52s)]
*  At least that's what I've heard. I don't I'm not actually sure if that's right or not. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2336.44s)]
*  There is something it's still so much fun. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2341.24s)]
*  And part of it is just because like this is the price that the Democrat [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2344.8799999999997s)]
*  establishment has to pay. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2352.12s)]
*  This is the albatross around their neck that will be around their neck for quite a [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2354.48s)]
*  while. This is essentially this is your punishment for propping up a senile [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2358.48s)]
*  president is that only with him, with anyone else like you could never get away with [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2364.8s)]
*  this if you were saying this about Obama or saying this about Trump. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2369.84s)]
*  But with Joe Biden, it's just like when you start saying, oh, he used the auto pen. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2373.28s)]
*  You have a real issue there because you're like there. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2377.8s)]
*  I just there is no way that he knew what he was signing. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2380.28s)]
*  And it brings up a lot of things like, you know, the way he dropped out of the race [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2384.0s)]
*  and how sketchy that was and, you know, like what really happened there. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2388.1600000000003s)]
*  So it's kind of it's it's smart politics in that sense to just kind of it makes you [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2391.96s)]
*  focus on that huge scandal again. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2397.1200000000003s)]
*  And then, of course, it does. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2400.4s)]
*  Look, you'd you'd I completely agree with you what you just said. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2402.1600000000003s)]
*  I think most people are probably more concerned with kitchen table issues, although I [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2406.36s)]
*  would personally think that like prosecuting Fauci is very high on the list of things [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2410.16s)]
*  we should do because the crimes that were committed were just so egregious and the [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2415.08s)]
*  people at the top should pay for that. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2419.3999999999996s)]
*  All of that said, I think you'd have to admit, even if you disagreed with even if [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2422.56s)]
*  you think that you did a great job or you think Biden was great or you hate Donald [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2426.48s)]
*  Trump, you think he's the devil. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2430.0s)]
*  You got to admit just like on the politics of the thing, it also just any chance you [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2431.44s)]
*  get to bring up the fact that he gave Fauci a blanket preemptive pardon is so it's [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2437.6s)]
*  such a loser politically like that just stinks of corruption. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2446.2799999999997s)]
*  And then when you think about like what the message on that actually is, it's one thing [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2450.12s)]
*  to say that you don't think Fauci committed any crimes and you suspect that the next [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2454.48s)]
*  administration is going to vindictively weaponize the justice system and go after [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2461.44s)]
*  him. But when you give a blanket pardon [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2466.92s)]
*  preemptively, essentially what you're saying is that even if he committed any crimes, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2473.0s)]
*  I still don't think he should be charged for that, because what if there were crimes that [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2479.6s)]
*  he committed that you didn't know about? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2483.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, and that comes out. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2485.48s)]
*  And so there's just something so dirty about that. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2487.16s)]
*  And look, in the case of Fauci, in the best case scenario, it's a gray area. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2491.28s)]
*  You know, like, I mean, he clearly he testified before Congress that the NIH did not [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2496.64s)]
*  fund any gain of function research and yet subsidiaries of the NIH were funding the [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2502.8399999999997s)]
*  lab where gain of function research was done. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2509.48s)]
*  Now, I'm just I'm sorry, but that is best case scenario. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2511.7999999999997s)]
*  A gray area. Best case scenario. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2515.68s)]
*  Like I take that and I think that's clearly lying to Congress. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2518.08s)]
*  People when you're on an enemy's list of Congress, people have been prosecuted for way [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2522.0s)]
*  less. People have been prosecuted for lying to Congress when they got a month wrong [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2526.04s)]
*  about a business deal. You know, you said June, but it was January. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2530.12s)]
*  And I've seen cases like that where it's like, yeah, but it was another J month. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2534.2s)]
*  I got confused and I said the wrong thing. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2537.64s)]
*  Like, sorry, lied to Congress. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2539.6s)]
*  So don't tell me that like claiming you never funded gain of function research when [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2541.68s)]
*  you did fund the lab that was doing gain of function research and then trying to [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2546.16s)]
*  redefine gain of function research away. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2549.88s)]
*  Don't tell me that that's a legit defense. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2552.52s)]
*  I know that's Fauci's defense. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2554.8799999999997s)]
*  You redefine everything. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2556.3599999999997s)]
*  Vaccine gain of function. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2558.3999999999996s)]
*  It all means something different than what we thought. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2560.0s)]
*  But it's just another reminder of this. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2563.0s)]
*  And it is one of the things that I find interesting is that. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2566.6s)]
*  If and I agree with you, I think legally speaking, and I'm no, you know, I don't [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2570.48s)]
*  have any legal expertise, but I do agree that it seems right what you're saying to [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2574.8399999999997s)]
*  me that that's an uphill battle. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2578.72s)]
*  I mean, imagine trying to prove in court that Joe Biden again, like, you know, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2580.6s)]
*  like you said, you said it perfectly, even if he was senile now and can't [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2584.72s)]
*  remember any of it, that doesn't prove that at the time he didn't know it. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2588.04s)]
*  How the hell are you actually going to prove that? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2591.08s)]
*  Seems very difficult to me. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2592.8399999999997s)]
*  But what it is doing is like letting the public know that like kind of [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2594.9599999999996s)]
*  floating out the idea, Hey, maybe they don't really have pardons. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2601.0s)]
*  You know, like maybe Fauci and Liz Cheney, maybe all these people [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2605.3199999999997s)]
*  don't really have that. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2607.9199999999996s)]
*  And if so, what's the appetite to actually go after them? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2608.9599999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2612.3599999999997s)]
*  Like it just, I just liked the idea of inserting that issue into the public. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2612.92s)]
*  I think there's something positive about that. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2618.48s)]
*  Um, and it's just another opportunity for Donald Trump to remind everyone of the, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2620.64s)]
*  the scandal that was the emperor's new clothes, Biden presidency, which is wise. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2625.44s)]
*  You know, I have a joke about this in my, in my act, but it is almost like there, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2630.6s)]
*  there is a weird way in which the Democrats and Joe Biden benefit from the [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2635.2000000000003s)]
*  fact that Donald Trump just sucks all the oxygen out of the room. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2641.56s)]
*  And so the story of the day is always whatever Donald Trump did now, or whatever [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2646.2s)]
*  someone, a ret, you know, Elon Musk did a Nazi salute or whatever, like the story [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2651.96s)]
*  of the day is, is always done. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2655.68s)]
*  And then that does in a way distract from what is gotta be up there with the biggest [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2657.96s)]
*  scandal in the history of the United States of America, that we had a non [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2665.36s)]
*  functioning president for years. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2669.8s)]
*  Um, and that it was totally covered up by the media. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2673.1200000000003s)]
*  And you know, I think anytime Donald Trump's kind of reminding Americans of that. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2676.36s)]
*  It's it's good politics for him. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2682.0s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2685.48s)]
*  It's a new sponsor who we're thrilled to have on board F G soap, uh, for dirty [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2689.0800000000004s)]

*  Did you know many commercially available soaps are actually classified as detergents [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2696.72s)]
*  due to their use of synthetic ingredients. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2702.56s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2704.9199999999996s)]

*  So from F G soap.com handcrafted in small batch process. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2708.96s)]

*  mind to create a better bar of soap and give big soap the middle finger while [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2724.88s)]
*  doing it fucking good soap is not just the name of the company. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2729.8s)]
*  It's a promise. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2733.28s)]
*  Choose from a myriad of incredible sense, including hickory and suede tobacco [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2734.44s)]
*  and bay leaf, Kentucky bourbon. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2739.44s)]
*  And of course the ever popular man bar with its perfect combination [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2741.6000000000004s)]

*  Well, it's good politics. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2766.6400000000003s)]
*  I'd like to actually see some execution on a, I guess, because I've been joking [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2767.88s)]
*  that Donald Trump, it's a lot of just click bait, click bait presidency. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2773.44s)]
*  We'll float a storyline like this and you'll get really excited. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2776.96s)]
*  Like, wow, are they actually going to prosecute Fauci? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2779.32s)]
*  And then that'll be the end of the conversation about it. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2781.6s)]
*  Yep. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2783.96s)]
*  Uh, specifically talking to Biden's dementia, I was saying while it was happening, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2784.56s)]
*  I think you guys can probably find clips in year one and year two of his presidency [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2789.28s)]
*  of, uh, whoever's around him that is masking for this should be held criminally [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2792.92s)]
*  responsible. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2797.32s)]
*  And I'd love to see, you know, those people brought in front of Congress and giving [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2798.48s)]
*  testimony about what his actual behavior was. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2801.8s)]
*  Because if you've been around people with dementia, it can become very obvious. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2804.48s)]
*  Like they have moments where like, Oh, the guy's still there. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2808.72s)]
*  And then when you put him down in a chair and he's like, Oh, are we still going to [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2811.24s)]
*  that dinner? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2813.8399999999997s)]
*  And you're like, I just brought you back from that. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2814.48s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2816.3199999999997s)]
*  And I'm willing to bet that people were around him and saw moments like that. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2817.44s)]
*  And you know, I don't know if you were a surgeon, let's say, and you were an [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2821.68s)]
*  alcoholic and I was your wife and I wanted you to continue to have that job. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2824.96s)]
*  And so in the morning I'm helping you get dressed up and I'm giving you some alcohol [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2829.7999999999997s)]
*  so that you don't have your wobbly hands. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2833.44s)]
*  And then you kill someone in surgery. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2834.8399999999997s)]
*  The person that that's an accomplice at that point, cause you're masking it. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2836.7200000000003s)]
*  And so maybe there's no crime of being president with dementia, but I think there [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2840.44s)]
*  should be. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2844.88s)]
*  And I think if you're incapable of doing the job and you're making decisions that [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2845.7200000000003s)]
*  are harmful for the entire country, there should be accountability for that. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2849.56s)]
*  And whoever's masking it, particularly if the guy has dementia, then he doesn't [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2853.84s)]
*  really have agency. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2858.04s)]
*  I mean, that's not a guy who's really using his higher consciousness to mold or [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2859.32s)]
*  make decisions. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2862.92s)]
*  So whoever's actually masking it for him is the person with agency and those [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2864.1200000000003s)]
*  people should be held accountable. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2868.96s)]
*  And then whoever was actually running, you know what I mean? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2870.4s)]
*  All of this should be investigated or at least paraded in front of the public. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2872.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's right. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2876.2400000000002s)]
*  And I don't know even that they can be prosecuted. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2877.2000000000003s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2879.44s)]
*  That should be a crime, you know, but at least they could be made to pay a serious, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2880.04s)]
*  you know, social cost for it. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2886.6400000000003s)]
*  And no, you're absolutely right. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2889.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, this was the thing that was so laughably absurd about the sharp as attack [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2890.52s)]
*  line, which is what everybody went with up until that debate, like literally just a [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2895.92s)]
*  few days before that debate when it became them, when they stopped pretending. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2900.8s)]
*  But that you would go and anybody who's ever been around an older family member [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2906.0s)]
*  who's gone senile, a very sad thing to watch. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2911.88s)]
*  It's truly tragic. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2914.88s)]
*  I know you've been around it, Rob. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2916.52s)]
*  I've been around it with family members. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2917.8s)]
*  But to see Joe Biden and to see him lose his train of thought and get confused and [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2919.52s)]
*  not know where to exit every time he eggs it at a stage and to not know what state he [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2927.04s)]
*  was in and to not know, you know, like when you watch all this and then to have everybody [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2931.84s)]
*  go know behind closed doors, he's sharp as attack. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2935.96s)]
*  It's like, yeah, that's not how dementia works. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2939.6800000000003s)]
*  I am sorry. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2943.1200000000003s)]
*  Dementia does not just like come about when you're in front of the cameras every [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2944.3199999999997s)]
*  single time and then go away and show no signs. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2949.48s)]
*  And my God, the things that people must have witnessed behind the scenes. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2952.64s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's yes, this was an open secret. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2957.16s)]
*  And, you know, really, one of the people who was very much implicated in that was [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2961.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris, who was out there saying that she was having weekly meetings with Joe [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2966.56s)]
*  Biden and that she was involved in all the most important decisions and that she was [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2972.16s)]
*  the last one to leave and that she spent all this time with him. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2975.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's just I'm sorry. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2979.08s)]
*  It's just it's beyond. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2980.24s)]
*  It's beyond anything that anyone could plausibly believe for her to claim that she [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2984.52s)]
*  never saw any signs of this guy's, you know, mental decline. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2989.8799999999997s)]
*  And it's just nobody believes that. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2995.48s)]
*  And she doesn't believe it. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2997.44s)]
*  None of her supporters believed it. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=2999.3599999999997s)]
*  Her chief of staff doesn't believe it. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3000.72s)]
*  Nobody buys that. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3002.56s)]
*  And so there should be some type of price to pay for that, because my God, what a [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3003.72s)]
*  crazy thing to do to just not have a president and then be lying to everyone. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3008.64s)]
*  Anyway, you know, we've talked about it a lot, but it's I think it's always good [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3014.3599999999997s)]
*  when this topic comes back up. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3018.3199999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3020.0s)]
*  Let's because we got a little bit of time left. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3020.24s)]
*  Let's play a little bit, by the way. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3023.16s)]
*  I did find this really fascinating. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3024.52s)]
*  But so there were there were a few clips that were great. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3027.6s)]
*  I've not watched the whole thing because I don't hate myself that much. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3030.04s)]
*  But Don Lemon was on Bill Maher's podcast and had a few just like incredible [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3033.36s)]
*  moments of just seeing into the window, into the dumb soul that is Don Lemon. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3042.96s)]
*  These things are so one of the things that's really fascinating is that people [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3051.56s)]
*  now that the corporate media has collapsed and then you've kind of seen this, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3056.0800000000004s)]
*  you know, you've seen some people who were able to either reinvent themselves or [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3060.7200000000003s)]
*  were just good enough at what they did so they could keep doing it like Tucker [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3069.0400000000004s)]
*  Carlson could just keep going and doing what he was doing. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3072.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, Pierce Morgan, I think, kind of reinvented himself in a way to have a [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3074.8s)]
*  very relevant show. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3079.0800000000004s)]
*  Now he was he was smart enough to figure out what this new media landscape was, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3080.48s)]
*  what people wanted, what type of show he could put on that they'd be good. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3087.36s)]
*  And then you've got the Chris Cuomo's and Don Lemon's of the world who like tried [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3090.76s)]
*  their hand at coming over into this world. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3097.6s)]
*  And it's almost like they're still playing the old game. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3100.64s)]
*  And it's just really funny to watch it just collapse and not work. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3105.16s)]
*  So anyway, on that note, let's go let's first let's go to the one that I sent [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3109.36s)]
*  first. And then if we got time, we'll play some of the other ones as well, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3113.28s)]
*  because there were a few good ones there. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3117.08s)]
*  Let's check in on old Don Lemon. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3118.56s)]
*  Your show's on YouTube. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3123.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a different mechanism. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3124.6800000000003s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3125.88s)]
*  Those are still people watch you on YouTube than watch you on CNN. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3126.52s)]
*  I think now I think they well you don't know the answer to that question. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3130.1600000000003s)]
*  No, no, I do know the answer to that question. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3133.76s)]
*  I think, you know, in my early days on CNN, I would say more people watched me on [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3135.12s)]
*  CNN. And then also when I was there, it was a different time. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3140.08s)]
*  I think more people watched me on CNN. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3143.84s)]
*  I don't know. I think more people watch me now. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3148.2s)]
*  But I think the highest point of CNN was during Covid. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3150.3199999999997s)]
*  And we had Covid and George Floyd at the same time and Donald Trump. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3153.08s)]
*  And that was the height that was the highest ratings, the most profitable CNN. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3157.48s)]
*  And so it was amazing to be there. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3161.2s)]
*  People watched every night. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3162.96s)]
*  Right. And they sort of relied on us because you were stuck. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3164.16s)]
*  Your show's on YouTube. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3167.0s)]
*  It's a different mechanism. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3168.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3169.2s)]
*  Those are still people. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3169.88s)]
*  So, by the way, I do not think he's right about that. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3171.6s)]
*  I think CNN had higher ratings periods before that. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3177.56s)]
*  But regardless of that, Rob, isn't that something? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3180.8s)]
*  Isn't that such an admission? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3184.56s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3186.64s)]
*  Well, it's infuriating to listen to. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3188.08s)]
*  Firstly, he's such a dumbass. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3191.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's funny the way that Bill Maher is a little bit cunty because off the bat, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3193.44s)]
*  he's like, wait, you don't know the answer to that. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3196.8s)]
*  How do you not know you were there? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3198.5600000000004s)]
*  Which he definitely does. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3199.88s)]
*  He definitely knows the answer to that. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3201.0s)]
*  They told you the ratings and you can look at your YouTube counter and you can [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3202.8s)]
*  probably speak to a better expert of how accurate the CNN ratings are and how much [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3206.0400000000004s)]
*  of it is Jim's in airport and how many people are actually watching it. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3209.52s)]
*  Versus the accuracy of the YouTube counter. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3214.36s)]
*  And then also when he talks about that during the covid era, it was exciting [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3217.12s)]
*  because so many people were tuning in. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3221.4s)]
*  But then also the profitability. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3224.08s)]
*  I don't know that that's all ratings as much as that could be. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3227.2s)]
*  The pharmaceutical companies were pretty interested in the continuing selling of [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3230.32s)]
*  that story. And you kind of see the circle of interest all getting along there of [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3233.7999999999997s)]
*  CNN sells the story. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3238.7999999999997s)]
*  They make more money, more people tune in, more people are scared, more people tune [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3240.2799999999997s)]
*  in, they make more money. The advertisers want to spend more there. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3243.92s)]
*  And I'm not saying that Don Lemon's smart enough to participate in that circle [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3247.2000000000003s)]
*  as much as be the face that will slap on the screen and say, read these words [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3251.48s)]
*  and only these words, because if you say anything else, it's pretty clear that [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3255.88s)]
*  you're anchorman. But, you know, I think [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3258.8s)]
*  there's there's something gross about the casualness and Elvis and him being [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3262.96s)]
*  pragmatic and going, well, it was fun to be there at that time because everyone [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3267.0s)]
*  was tuning in for manufactured nonsense. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3271.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's the thing, right? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3274.64s)]
*  You know, I was when I was on Piers Morgan today, I started arguing with that [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3276.6s)]
*  Julie Roginski chick a little bit. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3281.12s)]
*  At one point, she said, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3285.2s)]
*  she said something. I mean, she just doesn't know me. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3287.68s)]
*  We did some shows together back in the day at Fox News, but I don't think she [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3289.3199999999997s)]
*  really knows anything about me. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3291.88s)]
*  But I said something about Fauci and how he should go to prison. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3293.0s)]
*  And she was like, oh, you want to you want to relitigate 2020 now. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3297.2799999999997s)]
*  But what you don't want to talk about is January 6th. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3300.96s)]
*  What you don't want to talk about is Ukraine. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3303.6s)]
*  What you don't want to talk. And I was just like, yeah, Julie, that's [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3305.7200000000003s)]
*  you're barking up the wrong tree with that one. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3309.6s)]
*  Like, I don't know. People could accuse me of a lot, but not wanting to talk [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3311.48s)]
*  about Ukraine isn't one of them, you know. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3314.88s)]
*  And then I said to her at one point, I go, well, you know what? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3316.8s)]
*  I think Julie probably doesn't want to talk about is where were you in the summer [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3319.52s)]
*  of 2020? What were you saying back then? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3323.32s)]
*  Let's let's argue whether you were right or wrong about that. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3326.28s)]
*  And I'll argue with what I was saying back then. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3328.52s)]
*  What were you saying when the vaccine was first rolled out? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3330.24s)]
*  What were you saying? You know, it's like, well, it's so funny that Don Lemon [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3332.3999999999996s)]
*  would say, oh, we had the highest ratings at this time. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3336.16s)]
*  It was such a fun time to be around. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3339.7999999999997s)]
*  And you like the counter is you almost want to go like, OK, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3341.72s)]
*  what were you pushing back then? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3345.24s)]
*  And how much of it can you stand by now? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3347.8399999999997s)]
*  Because like, I'll tell you, man, you go you go look at and look, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3351.56s)]
*  I'm not saying like I've done this recently. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3356.12s)]
*  I'm pretty confident. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3358.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think people have been listening to this show for a while. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3359.88s)]
*  Be pretty confident. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3361.8s)]
*  Like you could pluck an episode out from, you know, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3362.6000000000004s)]
*  August of 2020. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3367.8s)]
*  Me and Rob could sit down and watch it. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3370.0800000000004s)]
*  And we'd be pretty happy with where we were and be like, yep, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3372.0800000000004s)]
*  we were pretty much right about the biggest issues. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3375.92s)]
*  You know, like I'll stand by that. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3378.1600000000003s)]
*  I'll still go argue that lockdowns are wrong and stupid and that they did [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3379.8s)]
*  way more damage than anything positive that came out of them. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3383.88s)]
*  I'll still argue that like the the nationwide riots were like horrific [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3387.08s)]
*  and, you know, shouldn't have been defended. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3392.2s)]
*  I'll still like all of this stuff. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3395.12s)]
*  I remember later in the year, but I remember the week [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3397.52s)]
*  the week of the Hunter Biden laptop coming out. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3400.92s)]
*  I remember me and you sitting down and being like, this is obviously his laptop. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3404.16s)]
*  And the claim that this is Russian disinformation is just clearly a lie [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3408.4s)]
*  to distract people. And it's like, oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3412.52s)]
*  You're like, oh, yeah, the ratings were good when the country was locked down. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3415.52s)]
*  Can you still defend lockdowns because you were defending them at the time? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3420.2400000000002s)]
*  Can you still defend that? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3423.4s)]
*  OK, the ratings were good when you were defending Black Lives Matter [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3424.48s)]
*  and calling them fiery, but mostly peaceful protests. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3428.68s)]
*  You still want to defend that? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3432.44s)]
*  The ratings were good when you were claiming Trump was a Russian spy. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3433.96s)]
*  Do you still want it's like, oh, yeah. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3437.36s)]
*  So you got ratings off a bunch of fucking lies. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3439.28s)]
*  And like, and people woke up to him eventually. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3443.72s)]
*  Anyway, and then there's just the dishonesty of I don't even know [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3446.52s)]
*  what are the YouTube numbers. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3449.12s)]
*  Well, I guess if anyone in this game has no concept of whether their ratings [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3450.48s)]
*  are higher or lower than they were a few years ago, it's all just kind of ridiculous. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3454.3999999999996s)]
*  Here, let's go, go, go to the one that I texted to the group, Natalie. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3459.4399999999996s)]
*  Let's play the the one that because it's so funny how like [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3463.48s)]
*  it's just it's just amazing how much. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3467.9599999999996s)]
*  And this is a huge part of the reason why the podcast world took off [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3470.84s)]
*  and the corporate media world died. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3474.96s)]
*  But just there are so many shows like this now. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3476.76s)]
*  And just like the level of conversation is, I don't know. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3480.32s)]
*  It's at least 30 IQ points higher than whatever the hell is happening on CNN. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3485.8s)]
*  And to look at Don Lemon here again, what's interesting about Don Lemon [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3491.8s)]
*  is kind of like Chris Cuomo is that he wasn't this isn't just like a guy [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3494.56s)]
*  who happened to be at CNN. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3498.92s)]
*  These were the biggest shows. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3500.52s)]
*  These were their marquee names. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3502.48s)]
*  It was Cuomo and Don Lemon, their shows, and then they're back [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3504.56s)]
*  and forth in between the shows. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3508.2s)]
*  This was the highest rated thing that CNN had [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3509.6s)]
*  during these days that he's claiming were, you know, the great ratings days for CNN. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3512.84s)]
*  So it's just interesting to see, like their level of analysis. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3517.68s)]
*  And here is Don Lemon giving you what essentially it's like [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3521.64s)]
*  the Joy Reid level of political analysis. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3525.4s)]
*  It's all they have to offer. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3527.84s)]
*  So here's Don Lemon. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3529.88s)]
*  It's the same thing that I would I see not all black Republicans, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3533.0s)]
*  but I see a black mega person who is carrying Donald Trump's water [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3537.1600000000003s)]
*  and they know that he's lying. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3540.92s)]
*  It is a shortest line to the front, because if you're black and you're whatever, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3542.44s)]
*  any you're just in line with a bunch of other Democrats [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3546.76s)]
*  that are doing the same thing that that you're doing. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3549.52s)]
*  But if you become a black mega person, it's like, whoa, let's book this person. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3551.96s)]
*  Let's put him on television. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3555.7200000000003s)]
*  So you don't think you can be a sincere black mega person? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3556.6800000000003s)]
*  No, no, I just said I don't think that I just said [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3560.04s)]
*  I think there can be sincere Republicans. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3563.6400000000003s)]
*  But you can't be a sincere black Republican. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3567.08s)]
*  I don't think that you can I don't think that you can be a rational mega [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3569.48s)]
*  be black and be a rational mega person. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3574.04s)]
*  I think you can be black and be a Republican. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3576.36s)]
*  I think they would find them very insulting. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3578.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, the truth is often insulting. It's the same. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3580.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes, it is true that the truth is also is often insulting. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3584.96s)]
*  Also, just idiotic statements can be insulting sometimes. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3589.92s)]
*  Isn't it like it's just so pathetic. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3594.56s)]
*  And this is the game that really in the era of the Don Lemons, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3598.12s)]
*  in the era of Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon and Joy Reid, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3603.88s)]
*  kind of in the time that these people became like the anchors, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3607.32s)]
*  that this was the type of just just. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3611.32s)]
*  I don't know how to put it, profoundly stupid poison [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3615.08s)]
*  that they would just pump into America. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3620.96s)]
*  Then it really just can't be stated how destructive this was [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3623.56s)]
*  to always just whittle everything down to a race issue. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3627.7999999999997s)]
*  Constant insinuations of bigotry against anybody who who disagreed with them. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3631.64s)]
*  And it's just the the Joe Biden, you ain't black comment, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3637.3199999999997s)]
*  essentially is what Don Lemon has there. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3640.68s)]
*  Then he tries to attach it to a point, but he's done lemon. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3643.04s)]
*  So he's just really stupid. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3646.52s)]
*  And he doesn't really understand the point even he's making. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3648.0s)]
*  And like, yes, there is some truth to the fact [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3650.88s)]
*  that you cut the line if you were like [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3654.96s)]
*  the if there's less of you, you know, like if you fall into some category [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3660.04s)]
*  where there's like, oh, that's more unique to see. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3665.52s)]
*  It is true that you're more likely to get booked. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3669.08s)]
*  This is also true. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3671.4399999999996s)]
*  It has nothing to do with race. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3674.04s)]
*  I mean, like, for example, like like Dave Rubin has a huge YouTube show. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3675.8799999999997s)]
*  And one of the reasons why Dave Rubin has a huge YouTube show [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3680.3199999999997s)]
*  is because he was the young Turks guy, then became a conservative. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3684.04s)]
*  He left the left. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3688.96s)]
*  And so now that becomes like a story. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3690.52s)]
*  Also, Liz Cheney. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3693.3199999999997s)]
*  What do you think Liz Cheney would have been? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3695.6s)]
*  How many media appearances do you think she would have had [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3698.7999999999997s)]
*  if she hadn't been going after Donald Trump in the way she was? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3701.24s)]
*  There's lots of different angles. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3704.56s)]
*  But for him to sit there and say, you cannot be a since [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3706.52s)]
*  like no black person could support Donald Trump. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3710.68s)]
*  There is no issue you could possibly you couldn't just be. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3714.48s)]
*  Let's say a black dude who was against illegal immigration [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3718.04s)]
*  or who was against fighting forever wars or who was [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3722.04s)]
*  against the inflation of the Biden administration. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3726.0s)]
*  Why? Somehow as a white guy, you can legitimately have those opinions, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3728.52s)]
*  but a black guy couldn't. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3733.44s)]
*  It's just again, it's like it's a profoundly racist statement to make, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3735.28s)]
*  which has always been the case. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3740.1600000000003s)]
*  It's like these guys, they're like there's something out of [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3741.48s)]
*  like. Like a movie that would just like caricature racism in the past, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3746.6400000000003s)]
*  and they would just make some character that's just like a foaming at the mouth. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3753.16s)]
*  Bigot. It's like, oh, that's you. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3756.56s)]
*  That's you. You're just like a vicious racist. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3758.72s)]
*  It's the only lens that you see the world through. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3761.2s)]
*  Is that like, oh, black people are supposed to be over here on this plantation [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3764.56s)]
*  only thinking one way. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3769.6s)]
*  And if you dare cross over there to the other side, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3771.48s)]
*  then you're some type of fucking sellout. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3774.64s)]
*  And who the fuck is Don Lemon to speak for black people, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3776.8399999999997s)]
*  for the least black black man in America? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3780.76s)]
*  Like really, the multimillionaire gay dude [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3784.28s)]
*  who's banging a white dude living in a white neighborhood. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3788.2000000000003s)]
*  Like what you get to decide, you're the arbiter to say like, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3792.1200000000003s)]
*  well, you can support Mitt Romney. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3796.0400000000004s)]
*  I'll allow a black guy to support Mitt Romney, but you can't support Donald Trump. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3799.0800000000004s)]
*  Why? Why do you get to choose that? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3804.2000000000003s)]
*  Like fuck off, Don Lemon. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3806.96s)]
*  I don't know. I'll give you the final word, Rob. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3809.12s)]
*  Then we got to wrap up. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3810.68s)]
*  Well, what am I going to say? That's better than fuck off, Don Lemon. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3811.8399999999997s)]
*  I think you nailed it on that one. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sfnWKiFYQ&t=3814.8399999999997s)]
