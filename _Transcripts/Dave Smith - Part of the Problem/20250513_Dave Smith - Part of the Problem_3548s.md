# Dave Smith | Trump VS. The Neocons | Part Of The Problem 1263
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE)
*  Oh, what's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. I am Dave [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=0.0s)]
*  Smith. He is Robbie the fire Bernstein. Thank you everybody for listening. How are you today, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  Roberto? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=17.76s)]
*  Appleton, Wisconsin, my friend, just a couple days away and I didn't realize this was the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=18.76s)]
*  branch of comedy clubs that has the good whiskey. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=23.92s)]
*  Ooh, that's right. Yeah, I did know that, but I forgot. That's right. We're going to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=26.32s)]
*  the good whiskey comedy club that you know what that means. Watch out ladies. Me and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=30.4s)]
*  Rob are going to be puking all over Appleton, Wisconsin. Yeah, I'm excited to go there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=36.56s)]
*  It's our first time. My first time I think ever going to Appleton. I don't know about [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=42.96s)]
*  you, but definitely the first time we've done comedy out there. So yeah, come on out. There's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=46.84s)]
*  Go to comicdavismith.com to grab them looking forward to a nice weekend to comedy shows. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=51.88s)]
*  And then you got a bunch of stuff going on, right Rob? Oh my God. So many porches, Lord [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=58.92s)]
*  and VA, Virginia Beach, Morristown, New Jersey, and then Austin, Texas and San Antonio and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=62.72s)]
*  one other Texas spot porch store.com. A lot of porches going on. There you go. There you [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  go. All right. So as, as you find people probably know, we did not have an episode yesterday. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  I do apologize for that. I will try my best to, to see if we can't make that one up. But [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=81.76s)]
*  of course I was, I was up in Maine recording with Tucker Carlson, the episode we recorded [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  it yesterday and it came out late yesterday. Great response so far. And it's just, I can't [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  say enough good things about Tucker Carlson. I just love that guy. I could talk to him [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=100.0s)]
*  for 10 hours, just such an interesting guy. And I really, you know, I've been, I've been a big [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=104.8s)]
*  Tucker fan for a long time and I think I, I might be wrong about this. I believe I was the first [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  guest that was on it. Like that was my third time and I think I'm the only one who's been on three [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=118.0s)]
*  times. So that was kind of a cool little thing unless I'm wrong about that, but don't correct [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=123.6s)]
*  me if I am. I want to live in the world where I'm, I'm right. Put it on Tucker numbers. Just [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=128.16s)]
*  let Dave have this. Yes. Yes. That's right. But anyway, it was just, it was, it was really great. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=132.48s)]
*  And I really appreciate the way he's had my back on, on so many of the, the more controversial [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=137.84s)]
*  opinions that I've taken, but really enjoyed the time up there. And I'm glad so many of you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  enjoyed the episode. If you haven't seen it already, it's up on, on, on Twitter and on YouTube. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=149.04s)]
*  And so you go find it if you want to. All right, let's jump into some stuff because I did talk a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=153.76s)]
*  little bit about some of this with Tucker. But I thought like me and you kind of got to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=160.32s)]
*  discuss this a little bit. And it's again, it's one of these things. It's like, there's a lot of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  this with Donald Trump as president. Part of it is because Donald Trump is such an unorthodox [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=173.04s)]
*  president. And as we've discussed a million times, you know, you always got to kind of take [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=180.0s)]
*  everything he says with a grain of salt. You never know which way things are actually going. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=184.64s)]
*  You know, like it's, it's, it's very, you know, when Obama first came in, right, and he ran on [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  healthcare reform, and there was a little bit of a debate over, you know, like at first, if you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=198.4s)]
*  remember back to these days, Obama was very critical of the public option. Hillary Clinton [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=205.36s)]
*  actually ran on a public option and Obama criticized her for it. Obama actually, he died, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=211.2s)]
*  one of his famous lines, which was a very good line in the debate, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=216.8s)]
*  that he said to Hillary Clinton, he goes, mandating that uninsured people buy healthcare [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=221.52s)]
*  makes about as much sense as writing a law to mandate that homeless people buy homes, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  which I always thought was a great line. Like, yeah, that doesn't really solve the problem, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=234.56s)]
*  just forcing someone to purchase something. If they're not purchasing it, it's probably [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  for a reason, meaning like they can't afford it might be a good one. Anyway, my point is that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=242.08s)]
*  generally speaking, you knew Obama was going to attempt to pass some type of healthcare bail. Now, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  it ended up having the public option in it. You didn't know whether that was going to be the case. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=255.52s)]
*  You didn't know if he was going to go for universal healthcare or just settle for the Obamacare that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=259.12s)]
*  he settled for, but you kind of knew the direction he was moving it with Donald Trump. You never know. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you just don't know, and we might get into this a little bit on the show too, but you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=271.36s)]
*  don't know if by the end of the year, we're going to be living in a lower tariff environment or a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=275.12s)]
*  higher tariff environment. Even though he's staking out this position as like, I want to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  raise tariffs, you feel like there could be a reversal. Donald Trump, of course, in his first [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=284.64s)]
*  four years had a tremendous turnover rate within the people around him. It hasn't been quite as [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=291.04s)]
*  crazy in the first hundred days, but he has already gotten rid of his national security advisor. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=297.92s)]
*  Anyway, which is related to all of this. Taking all of that into account, taking all of this with a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=303.76s)]
*  grain of salt, there does seem to be some real friction between the Israelis, the War Party, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  and Donald Trump right now. It seems things are looking much more promising than they were a month [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=321.84s)]
*  ago when things looked quite bad. It seemed like a strike on Iran was imminent. Now it does not [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  seem that way. It seems that there's been some pretty good reporting on this, that there really is [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=337.28s)]
*  a fallout between Netanyahu and Donald Trump, which is just very interesting. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=344.32s)]
*  And look, I don't know for certain how true any of this is, but a lot of people on the inside are [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=350.56s)]
*  saying that this was also a big part of why Mike Walz got fired and that he was basically going [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  behind Trump's back to Netanyahu. Donald Trump found out about this and cut him loose. The reason [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=366.48s)]
*  why I'm tending to think this is real is just because of the way the neocons have been flipping [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=373.04s)]
*  out over the last few days. They are very upset about a few major developments. Obviously, there [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=379.76000000000005s)]
*  was the big one which we talked about that Trump flat out rejected Netanyahu's war plans for going [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  to war with Iran and then started engaging in direct talks with them. However, what really sent [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=393.04s)]
*  them over the line was that then Trump started engaging directly in negotiations with Hamas [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=399.52s)]
*  without Israel being involved. This has led to a bunch of people freaking out on Witkoff, Trump's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=405.44s)]
*  envoy who originally negotiated the ceasefire. He was the one doing the negotiations with Hamas [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  and now he is getting called all types of names by Mark Levin and Ben Shapiro. So that's always a [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=420.32s)]
*  good sign. When Mark Levin and Ben Shapiro are attacking the Trump administration, good rule of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=426.8s)]
*  thumb is something positive is probably going on. Any thoughts on any of this, Rob? Oh my god, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=431.92s)]
*  I got a lot. Let's start with, you never know what the hell is going on with Donald Trump. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=438.56s)]
*  He does two things and they work really well for him. One is he drops extreme anchors in negotiating [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=443.76s)]
*  so he takes purposely unreasonable positions knowing that he's going to walk it back. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=451.84s)]
*  And then the other thing he does is he never gives any specifics. He never actually lays out any [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  like real intellectual theory behind his plan how it's going to work. Instead it's always, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=462.32s)]
*  it's me so it'll be great. And because he plays both those cards, he can always walk back from [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=467.84s)]
*  anything or anything can work out and he can go, that's exactly what it was supposed to be. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=473.44s)]
*  It worked out perfectly. So he does a very good job of kind of creating chaos and never having [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=477.84s)]
*  to own a position, which is what allows for people to say, oh, it's 4D chess and he's always right. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  Please don't forget your thought there, but isn't part of that and what's so interesting [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=491.52s)]
*  about that dynamic is that Donald Trump has no ideology. He has no, like he's not a thing. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  He's not a conservative. He's not a libertarian. He's not a liberal. He's not anything. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=503.12s)]
*  His only ideology is like winning. And so no matter what he does, he can always spin it as that. Yeah, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=508.72s)]
*  no, I'm holding true to my stated principles, which is I'm great and we're winning. That's always it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=516.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, keep going. Like just take tariffs. If you really wanted a concerted plan for more [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=521.44s)]
*  factories within the United States of America and can so, can you outline to me how the tariffs [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=527.52s)]
*  are going to bring us more? And so if tariffs are going to bring us more, why would you walk it down [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=533.52s)]
*  with China to 30%? Are you now turning your back on the idea of tariffs building more manufacturing [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  with the United States of America? Is there some reason why 30% is actually the perfect number? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=544.24s)]
*  The point is he's always flying off the seat of his pants and he's gotten out for declaring a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=549.36s)]
*  victory and he changes his mind quite a bit. But seemingly with the Israel thing, I'm just going [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=553.44s)]
*  to take a wildly speculative guess here that something happened behind the scenes between [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=559.44s)]
*  Netanyahu and Trump. And Trump said, no, you are not going to be bossing me around. And the other [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  thing that happened the other week was they negotiated a ceasefire with the Houthis that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=570.32s)]
*  the Houthis will no longer be striking American ships and we will no longer be attacking the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=575.44s)]
*  Houthis. But we worked out no deal for Israel and that arrangement. And then speaking to the new [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=579.92s)]
*  plan or the new agreement, which got the last American hostage home, I mean, talk about making [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=586.4799999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu look bad. We didn't have to bomb a single kid to do it and we didn't have to get [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  a single concession to do it. We just had to tease that we might back them for further ceasefires, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  as far as I understand, as long as there was a goodwill gesture from Hamas to showcase the fact [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=602.16s)]
*  that I guess they were willing to negotiate or willing to engage in a ceasefire. And I mean, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=607.68s)]
*  you want to talk about a black guy to Netanyahu who's been bombing the hell out of kids saying [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=612.0s)]
*  that he wants to get rid of Hamas. You've got just as many Hamas fighters at the start of the war, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=616.8s)]
*  80% of the tunnel network still intact and the claims that they can't negotiate or deal with [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=620.88s)]
*  Hamas or I don't know why they couldn't get these hostages home, but the fact that the Trump [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=625.76s)]
*  administration in one attempt of direct, not even direct communications through some back channels [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=629.28s)]
*  was able to get it done really leaves some explanation to the Netanyahu team on why they've [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=634.4s)]
*  taken the strategy that they have and why they can't get the other ones home. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=641.6s)]
*  Well, right. I mean, look, it's any time and this is something that's interesting and I've tried, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=644.72s)]
*  you know, because I've done a lot of debates on this subject and I've tried my best to parse [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=650.48s)]
*  this out at times because what will happen is people who are defending the Israeli assault on [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=654.56s)]
*  Gaza, there are two very separate and at times, you know, in competition, there's two separate [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  objectives that they always bring up and one is retrieving the hostages and the other is taking [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=672.24s)]
*  out Hamas. Now, the people who support the war, Benjamin Netanyahu included, you know, and like [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=678.72s)]
*  all the way down to everybody who's just supports what Israel's doing, they like to invoke [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=685.6s)]
*  retrieving the hostages because of course, you know, when you're defending the morally [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=693.44s)]
*  indefensible, that's the better one to bring up. It's much easier to be like, hey, we have to do [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=698.48s)]
*  what we have to do to get our people back because our people are there. But of course, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=702.88s)]
*  these are two different goals and what happens a lot in life when you have two different values [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  when they're in competition with each other, you find out which one you value [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  more. This happens all the time, you know, whatever to us in life, you know, you might, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  you might really want to go grab some food at your favorite restaurant, but like your brakes [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=726.96s)]
*  aren't working in your car and you go, yeah, I'm not, I don't feel comfortable to drive this [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=732.32s)]
*  thing. So I'm not going to go to the restaurant. You know, it's like, yes, you did value going to [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  the restaurant, but when it turns, when it comes to it, you actually value your own safety quite [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=741.84s)]
*  a bit more than that. And so you're like, no, I'm not willing to risk my safety to go get this [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=745.84s)]
*  other thing I want. Now, as far as this has been pretty obvious, I think from the beginning of the [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=749.52s)]
*  conflict, but you don't, if your number one priority is getting the hostages out, you don't [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=754.4s)]
*  start leveling the place. Obviously no one would ever do that. If it was someone they loved in [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=760.5600000000001s)]
*  Gaza, you wouldn't, oh, flatten Gaza. That'll get my, you know, father out safely. So another one of [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=766.8s)]
*  the things that's interesting here with all of this is that repeatedly, and there's been a lot of [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  reporting on this as nothing that I figured out, but Hamas has on multiple occasions offered to [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=780.9599999999999s)]
*  release all of the hostages. Now, what they've demanded for that is a permanent ceasefire. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=787.68s)]
*  So they're basically saying, we'll release all of the hostages on the deal that the war's over, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=794.0s)]
*  that you got to stop bombing Gaza. And Benjamin Netanyahu has been very clear that he's like, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=800.4799999999999s)]
*  no, we're not going to do that. He said in his own words that he goes, the primary objective is still [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=807.5999999999999s)]
*  to eliminate Hamas. And so this is a perfect example of where these two goals are in conflict. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=812.88s)]
*  And it's very clear what the Israeli government values more. They're like, no, we like, I think [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=821.36s)]
*  maybe they'd like the hostages out. But they are like, it's more important to us that we get to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=827.6s)]
*  continue bombing Gaza. So, you know, one of the things that's been interesting here is that [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=834.08s)]
*  you, this has just been very revealed. And in fact, I think it's been very revealed how little [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=841.52s)]
*  your hardcore Israel supporting favorite influencer actually cares about getting the hostages out. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=848.72s)]
*  And the reason I say this is because, look, Benjamin, excuse me, Ben Shapiro, my mistake, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=856.24s)]
*  Ben Shapiro just put a video out attacking Witkoff saying that he doesn't think he knows [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=863.6s)]
*  how to negotiate anything. And he's making a mess of this whole situation. Witkoff is the envoy [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  who went over and got the ceasefire. The original ceasefire negotiated in phase one of that ceasefire, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=875.84s)]
*  something like 20 hostages were returned. And there was supposed to be more return in phase two, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=883.44s)]
*  but Israel violated the ceasefire. But like 20 people's lives were saved over that. Who, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=888.0s)]
*  who sitting here could argue that that wasn't a good thing? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=894.4000000000001s)]
*  It seems like a rich claim. When you actually have success and you get a hostage home, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=897.76s)]
*  and especially for America first, and there's American hostage over there, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=903.44s)]
*  and you're able to retrieve the guy, that sounds like a success. So I don't know how you possibly [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=907.12s)]
*  sell that as disastrous negotiating when it's one more hostage that's out. I mean, if I was [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=911.2800000000001s)]
*  outside of a bank with hostages and I got one out, that's one more than one better. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=917.2800000000001s)]
*  That's one better. Yeah. Yeah. I think what it points to is this constant [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=921.84s)]
*  narrative that the Jews would love to have or Israel would love to have peace, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=927.36s)]
*  but the other side won't engage in a conversation and we can't possibly. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=932.32s)]
*  And so when you actually have a conversation with them and you get a hostage back, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=937.44s)]
*  that undermines this message of, Hey, we need to be in there and bombing kids. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=941.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's what it also is actually complaining about. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=945.84s)]
*  Well, especially when you're trying like essentially what just happened is now, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=948.48s)]
*  right? Like, again, look, let me say, because sometimes often the rejoinder will be people go, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=953.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, so you trust Hamas or something like that. It's like, Oh dude, I don't trust anyone involved [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=958.72s)]
*  in this situation by the way, including my government, including the Trump administration. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=963.76s)]
*  I don't trust anyone involved here, but like you put a ceasefire into effect. Hamas did release 20 [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=967.6s)]
*  hostages in the first phase of it. There's kind of no reason to think like once they follow through [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=975.0400000000001s)]
*  with that, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have followed through with their deal to release [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=980.32s)]
*  all the hostages if for a ceasefire. Now, I don't know, maybe they wouldn't have, but it seems at [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=983.6s)]
*  least like it would be worth pursuing that. But so what happened here, which is just, I think to [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=988.32s)]
*  your point is like what made it so clear is that so first you have these, you have these rounds of [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=994.32s)]
*  negotiations with Israel Hamas and the Trump administration, by the way, in order for Wittkopf [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=999.9200000000001s)]
*  to get that ceasefire, it was Israel who he had to put the pressure on, not Hamas. Hamas agreed. It [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1007.36s)]
*  was the same deal that Biden had been sitting on since last May. So it wasn't like that they were [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1012.0s)]
*  the ones who needed to be pressure. Then after whatever flare up between Netanyahu and Donald [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1016.72s)]
*  Trump, they cut Israel out and Wittkopf just negotiates with Hamas and gets the American [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1024.96s)]
*  out. Now, there's a few things to say on this, but at least look from everything that's being [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1032.56s)]
*  reported, Wittkopf essentially said to Hamas that he was like, look, Donald Trump's coming to the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  Middle East. He's in the Middle East right now. I believe he's still in Saudi Arabia. We got a clip [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1043.52s)]
*  from him over there that we're going to play in a little bit, which is very interesting comment he [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1047.44s)]
*  made. But he goes, look, Donald Trump's coming to the region. It would do a lot for goodwill if you'd [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1051.04s)]
*  release the American citizen who's being held. And they agreed. They got nothing in return. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1059.04s)]
*  This is what's being reported everywhere, as you just alluded to, Rob. They didn't, the US didn't [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1065.6s)]
*  give up anything. They just basically asked them pretty please, will you let the American go? And [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1069.6s)]
*  that will, that will buy you some good faith in the negotiations going forward. And they got him [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1075.1999999999998s)]
*  out. Now it does seem now when I see all of these, uh, neocons who are furious about this, it does [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1080.56s)]
*  seem to me that perhaps they preferred this American being in captivity over there. Now, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1088.56s)]
*  when I say American, we could get into that in a second, because I do actually feel like this is [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1096.08s)]
*  almost necessary to state, but you can understand where they really did like the talking point that [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1100.08s)]
*  there's an American being held there too, because that kind of makes that, that makes America more [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1107.6s)]
*  involved. That frames Hamas as America's enemy, not just Israel's enemy. And it does seem like [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1115.52s)]
*  they really do not like the fact that the Trump administration through Witkoff was able to talk [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1121.68s)]
*  directly to Hamas and, and, you know, uh, negotiate the release of this hostage. And obviously like, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1127.68s)]
*  you know, it's kind of common sense that if you're in a conflict with a group and then there's a [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1134.72s)]
*  third party who's backing you in this conflict, the last thing you want is that third party who's [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1142.48s)]
*  backing you having direct negotiations that are bearing fruit with the group that they're funding [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1147.44s)]
*  you to destroy. So anyway, the whole thing is, is very interesting. I did think one thing that [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1153.52s)]
*  should be mentioned because I do look, I understand, um, if nothing else to remove that kind of [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1159.52s)]
*  pretense that of, Oh, look, Hamas has an American citizen. That's, that's a, um, you know, a hostage [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1167.68s)]
*  right now. I would, you know, the guy, first of all, the guy is a dual citizen. He's an Israeli [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1174.96s)]
*  citizen and an American citizen. And he was also serving in the IDF. And I just, uh, whatever, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1183.44s)]
*  I'm glad he's free. I don't want anyone to be hostages, you know, even, uh, soldiers, but [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1189.76s)]
*  anyway, you get my point where I'm going to this Rob, right? Like it's, it's just a little bit [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1196.72s)]
*  different. I do think that like, if the United States government is to exist and if it has any [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1200.32s)]
*  role, then like, yes, if there's a U S citizen who's held in some other country, we should be [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1205.2s)]
*  trying to negotiate back for them. The calculation on that does change a little bit when you put on [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1210.0s)]
*  a different country's military uniform. I'm sorry. I just don't view that in the same way. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1214.56s)]
*  And again, if, if an American went to go serve in you, I mean, it's different because Russia's not [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1219.6s)]
*  really engaged in pure terrorist attacks, but if you, if the American citizen went over, let's say [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1224.3999999999999s)]
*  to serve in Syria, he's serving in Syria and he gets hot and he gets, and he got taken over by, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1229.36s)]
*  you know, what Al Qaeda or ISIS out there. You could say an American citizens being held by Al [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1234.7199999999998s)]
*  Qaeda or ISIS, uh, but it's not like Al Qaeda or ISIS stormed an American compound. Right. Just [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1239.9199999999998s)]
*  went in and took a citizen. That's not, it's the wrong way to describe it. To your, to your point, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1246.0s)]
*  if an American were to say, Hey, I'm going to go volunteer and join the Ukrainian armed forces and [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1251.9199999999998s)]
*  they throw on a Ukrainian army uniform and they go to war and then like Putin, you know, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1257.12s)]
*  one of his soldiers kills that guy. It's not like Putin killed an American citizen. Like, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1263.36s)]
*  like yes, technically he did, but it's not as if they found some American citizen and just killed [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1269.04s)]
*  him and had no regard for the fact that he was one of ours. It's like, no, you put on an opposing [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1274.8799999999999s)]
*  military uniform and, and likewise, you know, the situation, however you feel about it, Israel has [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1279.9199999999998s)]
*  been occupying guy. I know they say it's not an occupation, but it is. It's the Israel's been [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1286.64s)]
*  occupying Gaza this whole time. If you're an occupying force and you put on that, that military [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1291.76s)]
*  uniform, you are in a different category than an innocent civilian. And sorry, the, the, and this [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1297.0400000000002s)]
*  has always been accepted that there's a difference between military combatants and civilians. And [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1303.0400000000002s)]
*  like, no, you're, you got into a fight, you know, it's like, you can't, if you, if you jump into a [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1307.68s)]
*  bar fight and start throwing punches, you can't be like appalled when a punch comes back at your [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1314.16s)]
*  chin. Like it's not the same thing as if you were just sitting at a bar and someone just hits you. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1320.16s)]
*  It's just different. So anyway, there is that little detail. Sorry, go ahead. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1324.72s)]
*  I think that that it's just an aside to the fact that for a while we've been hearing Israel is the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1328.5600000000002s)]
*  most strategic ally and that we need to have full support for them. And that the Donald Trump [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1333.2s)]
*  administration seemed like it was going to be as bad as the Biden administration and blanket support [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1337.76s)]
*  for Israel. And, you know, there was a lot of chatter of he might walk back the Ukraine war, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1342.64s)]
*  but it looks like the Iran war might be on. And I don't know what happened behind the scenes in the [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1348.0s)]
*  last two weeks, but this feels like when you're at a job and you've got a team that's been working [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1352.8000000000002s)]
*  on a project for two years, and then some other guy finally goes, no, I can close this deal and [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1357.8400000000001s)]
*  just gets on a call and makes the whole team look bad. And so it seems like the Donald Trump [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1362.48s)]
*  administration, I don't know what happened behind the scenes. Maybe it was that Netanyahu got busted [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1367.68s)]
*  talking directly to that guy, or maybe he tried exerting pressure in another way that Donald Trump's [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1371.84s)]
*  like, no, you're not doing that. But it seems like at least at the moment that Donald Trump [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1376.6399999999999s)]
*  administration is putting pressure on the Israelis for, hey, you're not dictating American policy. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1381.12s)]
*  And part of that was getting the American hostage out and saying, look, your whole thing about the [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1387.6799999999998s)]
*  only way of dealing with this situation and saving the hostages is by bombing the region is clearly [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1393.4399999999998s)]
*  not true. Yeah, well, that's right. Yes. And there's, you know, it's interesting, again, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1398.64s)]
*  this is speculation. But one of the things that's interesting, a very interesting dynamic is just [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1406.88s)]
*  who Donald Trump is and who Bibi Netanyahu is. And, you know, I guess the question has always been, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1414.0s)]
*  you know, like, what level of control does Israel have over the Trump administration? I mean, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1420.96s)]
*  obviously, Maryam Adelson gave Donald Trump $100 million or something in that ballpark. There's, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1427.6s)]
*  obviously, like, Pete Haggiseth and Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee, and there's people in his [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1436.24s)]
*  cabinet who are like, deeply committed to Israel. And then of course, there's always like the wild [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1442.0s)]
*  card of like, you know, what type of, you know, who was on what plane when and what dirt they have [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1449.68s)]
*  on anyone. But just in terms of personalities, you couldn't find more of like an oil and water [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1456.32s)]
*  combination because Benjamin Netanyahu is just so brash and so insistent on on flaunting like on [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1463.3600000000001s)]
*  flouting, what was the word I'm looking for. But just unlike any time, if you remember, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1474.32s)]
*  he would do this to Biden constantly, where Biden would publicly say, we've asked Israel not to do [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1478.24s)]
*  this. And then they'd go do that. And like, they'd constantly be like almost publicly humiliating [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1483.68s)]
*  the the US government was something they like to do. And you're like, Jesus, that is not going to [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1489.92s)]
*  fly with Donald Trump. I mean, how could it? And of course, you know, you add in the fact that [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1496.0s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu threw him under the bus after his first administration, congratulating Joe Biden [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1500.4s)]
*  before he was even declared the winner of the 2020 election. And you would just imagine that [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1506.96s)]
*  you're like, Oh, this is the type of shit that's gonna piss off Donald Trump. I mean, you know, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1512.64s)]
*  this is the guy who flipped out on Zelensky. And we all were like, Oh, yeah, dude, you can't talk [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1518.0s)]
*  to Donald Trump the way Zelensky tried to. But perhaps maybe we are kind of at that point. Now, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1522.0s)]
*  it does seem like Donald Trump still is I saw reporting earlier today that he does seem to [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1529.6s)]
*  want to go through with this plan for the US to take over Gaza. Netanyahu also just said recently [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1535.44s)]
*  that the Gazans have to go that this is the Israeli goal is to ethnically cleanse the entire strip. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1541.44s)]
*  And Donald Trump seems willing to help with that. But it seems like war with Iran continued war [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1547.28s)]
*  in Yemen was was a bridge too far. And you were very you were absolutely correct to point out [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1554.8s)]
*  that there was real significance. When Donald Trump announced that he had reached the peace [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  agreement with the Houthis that he said they won't be attacking American ships. Because really, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1568.64s)]
*  that what happened was they were attacking a bunch of Israeli ships, we started bombing them [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1575.52s)]
*  because of that. And then they started attacking American ships. And then they made a deal that was [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1580.56s)]
*  like, Hey, you stop attacking American ships will stop bombing you. But there was never an agreement [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1585.28s)]
*  that they'll stop attacking Israeli ships. And so there is there does just seem to be a little bit [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1589.6s)]
*  of daylight between where the regime in DC and where the regime in Tel Aviv are. And that I think [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1595.6799999999998s)]
*  is a very positive sign. So we'll see what happens. Anyway, the me and Tucker talked about this a little [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1603.6799999999998s)]
*  bit. But it was so Steve Witkoff was in an interview. And he said this is the quote from him. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1610.48s)]
*  He said the neo con element believes that war is the only way to solve things. And Trump believes [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1621.76s)]
*  that his force of personality, the way that he is going to respond to situations can bend people to [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1629.6s)]
*  do things in a much better way. I believe in that too. That was a Steve Witkoff's comment. Mark Levin [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1635.68s)]
*  quote tweeted this and said, by the way, neo con is a pejorative for Jew. Unbelievable. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1644.5600000000002s)]
*  It's not. I mean, it's yeah, of course it's not. But it's so you're like, this is but saying that [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1653.3600000000001s)]
*  you're a Jew. When you're a Jewy, when framing of criticizing everything is, oh, it's just [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1661.84s)]
*  anti semitism. So we can't have a discussion about policy. That's real. It's like the funny [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1666.9599999999998s)]
*  thing about it is, is that I was talking about this with with Tucker a little bit. But the thing [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1673.76s)]
*  that's so funny is that like, for those of us who are like old enough to remember, it is, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1679.36s)]
*  it's interesting when you know, like there are these terms, like, like woke is a good example [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1687.04s)]
*  of this, where woke is a term that is almost it in everyone's mind. At this point, it's almost [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1694.0s)]
*  thought of as a pejorative. Like that's you're insulting someone when you call it woke, you're [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1702.24s)]
*  like, oh, this is woke bullshit. This is more woke insanity. People almost forget that woke started [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1707.6s)]
*  as as a term like it was people self identified as woke, it actually started as like a black [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1713.44s)]
*  awareness thing. And then it became more of like the social justice thing. The same thing with [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1719.52s)]
*  social justice warrior, these were terms that people used themselves. And then they kind of [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1723.92s)]
*  like embarrassed themselves. And then people started using it as a pejorative. And now that's [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1729.52s)]
*  what people remember as similar thing is true with neoconservative. Now it's used almost exclusively [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1734.56s)]
*  by people like us who are criticizing neoconservatives. But like, I'm old enough [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1742.0s)]
*  to remember when that was the name they chose for themselves. They were self identified [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1747.12s)]
*  neoconservatives. And it wasn't until they hijacked US foreign policy, and every single one of their [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1752.8s)]
*  policies was a complete catastrophic disaster, that they started running away from this. But [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1758.88s)]
*  it's really funny to see now them turn around and say that, you know, like, it's a racial slur [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1764.08s)]
*  to call someone a neocon. It I mean, I'm not even it would be on the level of if me and you [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1773.52s)]
*  got complete control of US federal government policy, everything was a complete disaster. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1780.6399999999999s)]
*  And then someone went these libertarians ruined everything. And we went Whoa, whoa, whoa, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1787.76s)]
*  libertarian. That's, that's actually an anti semitic slur to say libertarian. You were like, dude, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1793.04s)]
*  that was your label for yourself. Go, go look at it. Go go read any of the documents from the [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1799.04s)]
*  project for a new American century. They called themselves neoconservatives. They were a bunch of [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1806.48s)]
*  leftists. They were all a bunch of Trotskyites who left Trotsky and stopped following him and [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1813.12s)]
*  came over and started pretending to be conservatives. But they called themselves [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1821.36s)]
*  the neoconservatives. So don't give me this bullshit about how that's a slur. It's only a [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1825.6799999999998s)]
*  slur, because they fucked everything up. And then we started calling them out for it. But also just [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1830.6399999999999s)]
*  the idea that this is somehow, you know, again, it's that I'll just say this, if you really do if [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1838.24s)]
*  you really do hate Jews, then you've got to love this framing. Like, who is this a gift to other [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1847.52s)]
*  than Jew haters to say that, like, oh, if you if you're America first, if you think it's better [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1854.4s)]
*  that we move away from a war of choice, rather than toward a war of choice, that means you hate [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1861.6s)]
*  Jews. Just think about that. Think about that narrative to hand someone. It's unbelievable [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1867.68s)]
*  that people like Mark Levin, it's like, dude, you're doing more to promote Jew hatred than [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1873.28s)]
*  anyone I could think of. But isn't that something Witkoff, the guy who just saved the life of a [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1879.04s)]
*  fucking IDF soldier who saved 20 Israelis before that, this guy somehow is a Jew hater for saying, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1886.72s)]
*  yeah, we should be negotiating the release of these guys and not waiting for Israel to fuck the whole [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1894.8799999999999s)]
*  thing up. And by the way, Israel is actively trying to fuck the whole thing up as it's going on. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1899.04s)]
*  It's truly unbelievable. Well, they try and spin it however they can. And sometimes when nothing [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1904.48s)]
*  else fails, just declare them anti-Semites. Yep. It is. It is also interesting to me how much, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1911.76s)]
*  you know, I mean, it's just Twitter, but Mark Levin just getting wrecked on Twitter for posting [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1920.08s)]
*  this. Everyone's seen through this bullshit. Wasn't Mark Levin in some sort of advisory role [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1925.12s)]
*  to the administration specific to Iran? Wasn't he granted? Maybe. You know, I don't remember. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1931.36s)]
*  I'm not sure. Maybe we can look that up. But anyways, we can move on. Yeah. But there does [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1938.7199999999998s)]
*  seem to have been some progress with the negotiations with Iran and does seem like [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1945.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's being fairly reasonable about it. It'd be interesting. We'll see where all of this [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1949.4399999999998s)]
*  goes. But I do. I want to play. I'm going to have to listen to the show to hear how he sells this [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1953.6s)]
*  one because it's just so funny. And when you brought that guy home and removed him from the [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1958.16s)]
*  tunnels, you endangered our entire country. It's just how do you even sell this one? And the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1962.4s)]
*  anti-Semites who were able to negotiate a deal. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it'll be something like I'm glad [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1968.32s)]
*  he's home. It's wonderful that he's home, but you cannot negotiate with Hamas. They're animals. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1975.28s)]
*  You can't negotiate with animals. Like, OK, well, he just did. I saved a guy's life. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1981.76s)]
*  This is all the there was an old Dick Cheney line about. So essentially for people who don't know. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1987.52s)]
*  So and Scott does a really good job covering this in enough already. Or maybe it was in [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=1995.28s)]
*  fool's errand. Actually, I can't remember now. But so, you know, when 9-11 first happened, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2000.16s)]
*  and essentially the Taliban were the ruling regime in Afghanistan and they had given they [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2007.68s)]
*  had led Al Qaeda stay. That was their crime. They were about as guilty. I always say as like [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2013.44s)]
*  a landlord is if one of his tenants murders somebody like they didn't do anything. They [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2019.92s)]
*  weren't involved in 9-11. They just like gave him a place to stay. And the and the Bush administration [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2025.44s)]
*  demanded that that they extradite Osama bin Laden and his men directly to the US that they hand them [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2032.88s)]
*  over. No questions asked. And the Taliban said no. And this is ultimately why we invaded [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2040.48s)]
*  Afghanistan. And so the Taliban said no, but they offered to extradite them to like a third [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2047.6000000000001s)]
*  country. I forget what their their thing was, but they were like, well, we'll send them to Egypt or [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2055.04s)]
*  whatever it was, and who clearly would have just sent them to us like we could have just done that. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2060.96s)]
*  And Dick Cheney said, you can't negotiate with evil. That's why he was his argument was you can't [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2066.48s)]
*  even talk to that because they're evil. And all that stuff. This is like, this is the bullshit [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2073.44s)]
*  that war hawks love to hide behind. You can't negotiate with evil. Meanwhile, they negotiate [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2079.44s)]
*  with every evil regime on the planet. If you can't negotiate with evil, then you can never resolve [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2085.2s)]
*  any conflict because most governments in the world are pretty fucking evil. So that's whatever. It's [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2092.8799999999997s)]
*  all just bullshit. I do want to play it. Natalie, I sent you the video. Let's play Donald Trump's [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2099.52s)]
*  comments today in Saudi Arabia. I thought this was was very interesting, especially with all the stuff [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2104.3199999999997s)]
*  that we're talking about kind of going on in the background while he's saying this. So let's play [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2110.24s)]
*  that clip. I'm not getting any volume on this. There we go. Yeah, let's just bring it from the beginning. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2114.96s)]
*  And it's crucial for the wider world to know this great transformation has not come from [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2132.08s)]
*  Western interventionists or flying people in beautiful planes, giving you lectures on how to [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2138.64s)]
*  live and how to govern your own affair. We boosted more camera layered marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2147.04s)]
*  were not created by the so-called nation builders, neocons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2153.76s)]
*  trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop cabal, Baghdad, so many other cities. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2160.96s)]
*  Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought by the people of the region themselves, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2170.4s)]
*  the people that are right here, the people that have lived here all their lives, developing your own [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2176.96s)]
*  sovereign countries, pursuing your own unique visions and charting your own destinies in [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2181.76s)]
*  your own way. It's really incredible what you've done. In the end, the so-called nation builders [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2188.48s)]
*  wrecked far more nations than they built and the interventionists were intervening in complex [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2194.96s)]
*  societies that they did not even understand themselves. They told you how to do it, but they [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2202.16s)]
*  had no idea how to do it themselves. Peace, prosperity and progress ultimately came not from a [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2207.52s)]
*  radical rejection of your heritage, but rather from embracing your national traditions and [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2214.56s)]
*  embracing that same heritage that you love so dearly. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2220.4s)]
*  So interesting comment there. Donald Trump takes a shot at neoconservatives and interventionists. I [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2229.04s)]
*  mean, he called them interventionalists, but that's okay. We'll let that slide as long as [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2236.4s)]
*  you're trashing neocons. He talked about how the nation builders destroyed more nations than [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2240.16s)]
*  they ever built, took a shot at the kind of liberal interventionism. Just, I don't know, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2246.96s)]
*  look, it's Donald Trump. You can only ever judge him so much by what he said today, but I would say [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2255.2s)]
*  number one, he's in Saudi Arabia. A president's words, even Donald Trump's words are a little [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2263.92s)]
*  bit more meaningful when you're delivering them to a foreign audience. He's not just riffing, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2269.84s)]
*  like this is what he wanted to say to them. And number two, it's just with all of the stuff that [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2274.0s)]
*  we just mentioned going on, it is interesting that that's where his mind is. That when he went [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2279.44s)]
*  there, he was like, eh, you guys can build this up better than we ever could and we shouldn't be [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2284.6400000000003s)]
*  involved. I think what happened is some Jew told Donald Trump that terrorists were a good idea, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2289.28s)]
*  and he nearly trashed his presidency and now he's going the other way. Listen, like I said, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2294.48s)]
*  I can't prove it. I think something happened behind the scenes between Netanyahu and Donald [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2302.48s)]
*  Trump takes extreme positions, particularly when he's trying to bully someone. And I don't know [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2307.12s)]
*  what happened over the last two weeks and I don't know how that might change next week if you see [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2312.64s)]
*  another attempt on Donald Trump's life. But it does seem like at the moment, Donald Trump is really [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2316.4s)]
*  poking at Netanyahu and saying, you're not bossing us around. And that perhaps the cooler heads [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2322.16s)]
*  within the Donald Trump administration have had his year last because he's a little bit ADD and [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2327.92s)]
*  it's who last spoke to him. We've seen incidents of that before. So it could be at the moment that [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2333.2799999999997s)]
*  some of the cooler heads have gotten his ear. And that's why, like, I don't know that this is [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2339.68s)]
*  going to be his position in two weeks from now, but at the moment, he's beefing with Netanyahu [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2343.92s)]
*  and he's going full Trump of, hey, you're not going to push me around and we're going to start [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2349.44s)]
*  exerting some pressure on you guys to get what we're looking for. Yeah, it does. Right. It seems [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2353.36s)]
*  like that again. It's a look. These things are it's Donald Trump. So you just never know. You never [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2359.92s)]
*  know who might he might fire the awful person who he was listening to and then start listening to [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2367.28s)]
*  the good person might fire the good person, start listening to the awful person. You just don't know. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2373.36s)]
*  But it's hard to not look at this and go, all right, that's pretty good. He does seem to be [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2377.6s)]
*  moving in the right direction. And, you know, there's it was Joe Biden who told Netanyahu early, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2382.88s)]
*  uh, early last year, if you remember, Rob, he said, you have days, not months to get this done [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2393.68s)]
*  because the whole global opinion was turning so hard against what Israel is doing. The poor people [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2401.36s)]
*  of Gaza anyway, years later, this note turns out they're just like, no, sorry. And the U.S. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2406.16s)]
*  has been backing them the whole time. And I do think that while this has always existed, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2413.52s)]
*  it does seem like the hubris and the kind of uncompromising demands, unwillingness to even [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2420.56s)]
*  take the most modest steps to just not hurt U.S. interests, even if that's just optics. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2431.84s)]
*  I think that probably is really catching up to Netanyahu. I agree with you. My read of this is [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2443.1200000000003s)]
*  that somewhere behind the scenes, that guy Trump just had enough of this guy, like kind of trying [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2448.4s)]
*  to alpha him in a lot of ways. All right, let's, uh, let's switch gears here for a moment because [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2453.76s)]
*  I do, we just, I think we haven't really talked about this and I do just think it's really, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2460.64s)]
*  it's worth, uh, it's worth mentioning because I find this to be fascinating. But so Joe, uh, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2465.3599999999997s)]
*  Jake Tapper, um, uh, has written a book about Joe Biden's cognitive decline and the coverup about [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2473.7599999999998s)]
*  it on both sides of it, make money on, uh, selling the fact that he's completely sharp [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2484.7999999999997s)]
*  and then make money on how, uh, how dare the administration lie to us because you're a [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2489.6s)]
*  journalist and you're supposed to do your own journalism, not just feed the information that [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2494.72s)]
*  the propaganda that the administration gives to you, to the American people. And so you're really [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2499.6s)]
*  just outing yourself for not doing your job, which is looking at reality and going, Hey, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2504.48s)]
*  the information that you're giving me doesn't really align with what I'm seeing right in front [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2509.2s)]
*  of my face. Well, what a remarkable complaint to go, Oh, the administration lied to me when [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2513.52s)]
*  they gave me propaganda talking points and the propaganda talking points turned out weren't true [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2519.68s)]
*  because I wasn't doing my job. That's what you're telling us. Pretty much, pretty much. You know, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2525.12s)]
*  I've said for a while now, um, and I got in an argument with some people ahead of time, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2530.48s)]
*  but I really think I was pretty clearly have been proven right on this prediction that I said that [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2535.04s)]
*  Donald Trump winning again was going to just be the death of the corporate media. And people would [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2539.92s)]
*  point out that like, Oh, they had very high ratings when Donald Trump won in 2016. And I was like, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2545.04s)]
*  yeah, but so much of that relied on the fact that they were telling you that they had the biggest [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2550.0s)]
*  story in the history of the nation, that the Donald Trump was a Russian spy. All the evidence [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2555.28s)]
*  was about to come out, but you got to stay tuned in to find out what the latest evidence is. And so, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2560.0s)]
*  but then when that flopped and then COVID, it was like, dude, I don't think they can go back to this [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2564.8s)]
*  well again. But the truth is that probably just as big as those two, even as, as big as COVID was [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2569.6s)]
*  the coverup of Joe Biden being senile because it was just so true. It was such a transparent lie. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2577.2s)]
*  It's really an, uh, more, it's a more unbelievable lie than even the COVID stuff or the Russia gate [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2585.12s)]
*  stuff, because you could just see it. You could look right in front of you and be like, obviously, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2590.72s)]
*  but it is like, they'd have to make you think you're crazy to convince you. You're not seeing [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2594.72s)]
*  what you're seeing anyway. Here is, let's go, um, because it's, it's pretty funny to watch these, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2602.56s)]
*  but let's watch them in the order that I sent them to you, uh, Natalie. So let's watch, uh, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2608.3999999999996s)]
*  the first one is the, um, uh, the Geiger Capitol, uh, tweet here's Jake Tapper on, uh, on, on Biden's [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2612.64s)]
*  cognitive decline. I'm just curious as to whether or not this kind of trying to hide [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2622.16s)]
*  what was happening with the president at the time had an impact on the press corps. Like, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2630.16s)]
*  why didn't we hear some of these details from what they actually saw and were dealing with trying to [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2635.2799999999997s)]
*  get information? Well, Alex Thompson and I, uh, were on the case as were lots of other reporters [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2640.24s)]
*  trying to figure out what was going on behind the scenes. Um, but bottom line is the white house was [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2648.24s)]
*  lying not only to the press, not only to the public, but they were lying to members of their own [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2654.16s)]
*  cabinet. They were lying to white house staffers. They were lying to democratic, uh, members of [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2658.24s)]
*  Congress, to donors about how bad things had gotten. And in fact, Alex and I started writing [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2664.08s)]
*  this book, uh, after the election of 2024, and we spoke with more than 200 people, most of whom, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2669.3599999999997s)]
*  almost all of whom were Democrats, uh, and almost all of whom wouldn't be honest with us or wouldn't [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2677.36s)]
*  be candid with us until after the election. And then after the election, we found out all of these [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2682.7200000000003s)]
*  things that when you looked at what was going on with president Biden at the time, it probably, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2688.08s)]
*  uh, doesn't surprise you the extent to which he was deteriorating, but now we have anecdotes and [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2693.84s)]
*  facts about what was really going on behind the scenes, uh, with details that Democrats wouldn't [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2698.08s)]
*  share with us until after election day. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2702.8s)]
*  All right. So this is what Jake Tapper is saying now again, Rob, I mean, I think you kind of hit [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2706.88s)]
*  the nail on the head before we even got into the clip, but this is already, even if we didn't have [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2712.8s)]
*  the track record of what Jake Tapper was actually doing, which we're going to play a little clip of [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2719.44s)]
*  in a second, but this is just, it's so transparently pathetic. I mean, like this is how you're going [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2723.36s)]
*  to attempt to shield yourself from criticism and place all of it on the Biden administration, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2732.72s)]
*  which is very convenient because the Biden administration is gone now, so they can be the [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2740.9599999999996s)]
*  fall guy, right? I mean, they already fell in the worst way possible, Joe, but he had to drop out [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2744.9599999999996s)]
*  of the race, couldn't even finish the, his election. Um, and then of course Kamala Harris got blown [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2750.3199999999997s)]
*  out. But like, again, Rob, this is on the level of if you go like, oh, well, um, I had no way [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2757.12s)]
*  of reporting on the fact that Rob is bald because he told me he had big, beautiful hair [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2767.68s)]
*  and all the people around him said he had very long hair. And you're like, yeah, but you could [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2772.7999999999997s)]
*  have just looked at it and told the truth like we did, but this isn't rocket science. Like we do this [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2777.6s)]
*  like it's very easy. How many times over the years did we play clips of Joe Biden and just be like, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2784.72s)]
*  yeah, obviously he's going through severe mental decline. We were talking about this in 2019, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2790.0s)]
*  in 2019, when he first announced he was running for president, we could all obviously see that [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2797.9199999999996s)]
*  like, yo, this was a different guy than the guy who was vice president. Um, and it got much worse [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2803.3599999999997s)]
*  between 2019 and 2024, but it was very clear already. It was very clear that the guy was [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2809.28s)]
*  losing it by the end. It was just impossible to deny, but for you to say this, oh, it turns out [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2816.7200000000003s)]
*  they were lying. Turns out they did know shocker. What a, what a shocking admission to, oh, they were [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2823.36s)]
*  aware. They were aware that this clearly senile man was not up to running for president again. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2831.52s)]
*  It's, I'll tell you too, the issue that they have is we, we kind of addressed this on the last show, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2838.16s)]
*  especially now when you see Joe Biden go out and this is going to be something that man is it, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2844.3999999999996s)]
*  it's devastating to the Democrats and the corporate media that Joe Biden could still go, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2850.08s)]
*  is still an ex president and might go do some interviews like he just did with the view, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2855.7599999999998s)]
*  because you've got to look at that and think to yourself, right? That this, where he is right now [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2859.2799999999997s)]
*  would have been a hundred days into his second term that they were all trying to get him to run [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2865.7599999999998s)]
*  for it. And they, you're telling me this dude still has over three and a half years left as president. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2871.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, what do you think Joe Biden's going to look like in three and a half years? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2879.6s)]
*  And, and this is not with the, as grueling of a schedule as he would have had if he was president, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2883.8399999999997s)]
*  the answer is not good. It's not going to look good. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2889.3599999999997s)]
*  Um, anything else you want to add, Rob? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2892.48s)]
*  Yeah, I would love maybe, uh, maybe I can speak to the people on the back end of the website, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2895.2799999999997s)]
*  but, uh, there were for sure moments on this show where I had said that there should be [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2899.52s)]
*  accountability for those that, uh, covered for Joe Biden, uh, in the same way. If you had a relative [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2903.92s)]
*  who was working as a lawyer or a doctor and they had dementia and you covered for them so that they [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2909.92s)]
*  could continue to make their paycheck and, uh, you know, they messed up, uh, they mess something up [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2914.72s)]
*  that cost a client or someone's life. There should be accountability for the family members [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2920.32s)]
*  or, and there was a whole squad of people that saw things that we did not see that [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2925.04s)]
*  showcased severe dementia. I am sure behind the scenes. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. They should have to, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2930.0800000000004s)]
*  they should be held accountable. And this is classic news where they'll tell you the truth, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2935.6000000000004s)]
*  where it's no longer relevant. Yep. And also while absolving themselves of any guilt of it, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2940.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, like in four years from now, if the topic comes up again, they can go, no, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2946.6400000000003s)]
*  we covered the fact that he was clearly, uh, yeah, not when it was relevant. When things are no [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2949.84s)]
*  longer relevant, you're happy to comment on it. It's exactly right. So that in two years from now, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2954.8s)]
*  when you go, well, no one ever said anything about Joe Biden, you can go, Jake Tapper wrote [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2961.04s)]
*  a whole book about this. What are you talking about? It's like, right, right, right. Yeah, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2964.96s)]
*  he did, but he didn't, you know, anyway, let's play this next clip. Cause it's just, it's, it's, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2969.1200000000003s)]
*  there is something where it's like one of the most fascinating details about, or details, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2974.56s)]
*  one of the most fast, not details, but one of the more, more fascinating kind of overarching, uh, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2980.96s)]
*  themes of where we are exactly in the state of our politics and news is that like, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2986.7999999999997s)]
*  it does seem like the corporate journalists just can not adapt to the new world. They just [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=2994.8799999999997s)]
*  can not adapt to the new reality. And one of the, you know, I like using this example a lot. Um, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3003.68s)]
*  but it was the, with the Tony Hinchcliffe, uh, thing when they were trying to go, you know, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3009.84s)]
*  a speaker at a Trump rally made a comment and not, you know, a shock jock comedian was roasting [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3015.2s)]
*  everybody at a place, you know, which you could argue is inappropriate, but you can't pretend [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3022.24s)]
*  it's a person making a, but when you look at this thing and like the Trump rally is streamed [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3026.88s)]
*  live to YouTube, millions of people watch it. It's then chopped up. It's all over Twitter. I mean, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3033.28s)]
*  by the time you could try to account for all of the clips, I mean, it's in the tens of millions [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3040.4s)]
*  of people have seen Tony Hinchcliffe do his thing. Tony Hinchcliffe also has one of the biggest shows [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3046.2400000000002s)]
*  in the world. Um, every week he gets more views than pretty much anybody in cable, cable news. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3051.76s)]
*  And so like people know who Tony Hinchcliffe is and they've seen the act. And then you're trying [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3060.16s)]
*  to go on TV and go, it was a speaker at an event, trashing Puerto Ricans. And you're like, dude, but [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3066.8799999999997s)]
*  like so many more people have seen this already. It's also like, they haven't figured out that [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3072.3999999999996s)]
*  there's like that game that you were just alluding to where if in three years they go, no one in the [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3077.52s)]
*  media ever said this. And then you go, what are you talking about? Jake Tapper wrote a book on [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3083.52s)]
*  this subject. That kind of would have worked at one time, but now we live in the era of internet [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3086.56s)]
*  clips. And so of course people have gone and found all this stuff. So let's play this next, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3094.16s)]
*  this next clip just to give you a taste of how Jake Tapper is right now saying it was the [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3100.48s)]
*  administration. They lied to us, absolving the media of blame. Here's Jake Tapper himself. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3104.56s)]
*  When it mattered. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3111.44s)]
*  How do you think it makes little kids with stutters feel when they see you make a comment like that? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3113.44s)]
*  It's very clearly a cognitive decline. That's what I'm referring to. It makes me uncomfortable. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3118.48s)]
*  You are no, it's so amazing. It's so amazing to me that- [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3123.44s)]
*  Try and figure out an answer. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3128.4s)]
*  A cognitive decline. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3130.4s)]
*  Biden embraces his stutter, talking about it while Trump mocks it, exaggerates it, belittles it. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3131.44s)]
*  He's sharp physically. I mean, mentally. I think the question is physically, right? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3136.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3141.6s)]
*  More so? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3141.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3142.24s)]
*  Right. And the guy who's his chief opponent is only three or four years younger than him. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3142.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3146.08s)]
*  I mean, you have questioned President Biden's age, mental fitness, ability to lead, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3146.3199999999997s)]
*  of those supporting Biden. You said, quote, shame on all of you, pretending everything is okay. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3150.3199999999997s)]
*  You're leading us and him into a disaster. Do you worry that you damaged him at all? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3154.0s)]
*  I don't doubt that you got hugs and handshakes behind closed doors today. And maybe even [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3158.24s)]
*  publicly, some of them, because they like you personally. But I've heard a lot of really nasty [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3164.08s)]
*  stuff about you from your Democratic colleagues. I mean, just like, what is he thinking? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3169.7599999999998s)]
*  Exercise and narcissism. I mean, false claims to the Wall Street Journal [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3174.72s)]
*  about President Biden's mental fitness and acuity. He's 81. And his memory, you know, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3178.48s)]
*  it doesn't seem great. It's not horrible, but I don't understand the outrage. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3184.3199999999997s)]
*  Quote, behind closed doors, Biden's shows signs of slipping. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3188.24s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is owned by News Corp, which is run by the Murdochs. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3192.48s)]
*  Beyond the headline, there is some critical nuance here. The article is mostly based on [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3196.0s)]
*  observations of Republicans, with former speaker Kevin McCarthy, the only one going on the record. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3200.08s)]
*  They do note in the article that most of the criticism comes from Republicans. Have you heard [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3205.6800000000003s)]
*  any concerns from anyone who has met with President Biden about him seeming a little slower? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3210.96s)]
*  No. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3216.64s)]
*  The Russians are trying to do to make us and the public not trust our election integrity. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3216.96s)]
*  Joe Biden has dimension, all this stuff. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3222.48s)]
*  All right. Rob, what can you say here? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3227.28s)]
*  He had his marching orders to sell a story. And so until the election, he was selling the story of [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3232.0s)]
*  how dare you make someone with a stutter feel bad? Firstly, if you have extreme stutter, maybe [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3238.7200000000003s)]
*  presidency is not the best job for you. But listen, how dare you make someone with a stutter feel [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3244.8s)]
*  bad? That's not mental decline, that's a stutter. And that's the extent by which he was going to [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3251.12s)]
*  sell this story and not actually look at reality and be honest with the American people. So look [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3256.72s)]
*  at him. He's profiting on both sides. When he was told to go sell it, he went ahead and sold it. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3263.44s)]
*  And then the second that he got different marching orders, now he's turning around and going, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3268.4s)]
*  how dare they tell me to have sold that story? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3273.36s)]
*  It's really unbelievable. It's like, look, dude, like you can sit here. And again, it's, I guess [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3276.8s)]
*  we've seen examples like this before. I guess it just never, you know, it's really, I suppose I [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3283.84s)]
*  should get over. I mean, it's kind of like a me issue or something like that. But you're like, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3292.1600000000003s)]
*  it reminds me of like Fauci saying he never recommended lockdowns. Like you, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3296.32s)]
*  you really think you can just come in here. I, I mean, sure. When I was on television, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3302.24s)]
*  but not me, that was the other organization. And it's, it's like, when you know, it's on video, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3307.2s)]
*  you know, it reminds me of Chris Cuomo telling me that he, he never mocked Joe Rogan for taking [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3313.12s)]
*  ivermectin. And then like they played the clip of him doing it. Like it's right here. We have it [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3319.8399999999997s)]
*  on video. Like, what do you think you could get away with this? It's unbelievable. But like [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3325.3599999999997s)]
*  there it is. It's not like, it's not that the administration was lying. It's that you were [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3331.36s)]
*  lying. Then not only that, but that you, you know, if you're going to say the administration was [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3337.6800000000003s)]
*  lying and they just didn't tell us, it's like, okay, but then anytime anyone tried to blow the [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3342.96s)]
*  whistle, you could count on Jake Tapper to be the attack dog who was going to put them in their [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3347.76s)]
*  place and say, Oh my God, what you're doing is terrible. You're mocking someone for having a [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3353.44s)]
*  stutter. There's no evidence. I mean, sure. There's some physical decline, but there's no [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3357.76s)]
*  mental decline or something. It's just, it's so absurd. And it's just a, it's fascinating [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3362.2400000000002s)]
*  to think that there's any chance that they can brush the stink of this off them. And there's [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3372.0800000000004s)]
*  just, I really think there's just no way they can. It's not there. The one, you know, as, as [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTIt9czbmE&t=3378.48s)]
