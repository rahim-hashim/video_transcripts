*  What is up everybody? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=90.0s)]
*  Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=100.76s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=103.24s)]
*  He is Robbie the Fire Burnstein. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=104.52s)]
*  How are you today, my good friend? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=106.44s)]
*  I am doing well. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  How are you, Mr. Smith? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Doing well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=110.72s)]
*  I am looking forward to our weekend in San Diego. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=111.72s)]
*  I am not so much the traveling part, but I am very much looking forward to the shows. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=116.0s)]
*  So come on out if you are in the San Diego area. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=120.72s)]
*  Come on out to the American Comedy Company this weekend. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=124.64s)]
*  Comic Dave Smith dot com for those ticket links. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=127.68s)]
*  Actually, we have a lot of gigs coming up in the pretty near future that I am very much [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=129.92s)]
*  looking forward to. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=134.6s)]
*  So go over to the website and check it out and come see us. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=136.34s)]
*  And Rob, you got to... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=139.12s)]
*  We are in the porch season. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=141.12s)]
*  I will be playing porches countrywide and the next runs are West Palm Beach, St. Augustine, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=142.24s)]
*  Florida, Austin, Texas, some other places in Texas. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=148.4s)]
*  Go to porchstore.com. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=152.36s)]
*  There are like 40 porches. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=153.36s)]
*  I will be playing a porch near you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=155.36s)]
*  Very cool. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Very cool. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  So all right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's get into some stuff for today's episode. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  Typically on the show, it is a rule of thumb that we both try our best to live up to that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=165.28s)]
*  we act as if Canada does not exist. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=173.2s)]
*  Good policy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  It's just a common sense policy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  It's a matter of survival. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  Well, okay. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=183.72s)]
*  But in all seriousness, we don't talk too much about Canadian politics because... [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=184.72s)]
*  We don't care. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=191.6s)]
*  Yeah, obviously. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=192.6s)]
*  There will be things sometimes that kind of break through. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=195.24s)]
*  Obviously the most notable stuff would be like when the trucker protests were going [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=198.32s)]
*  on during COVID, we did a lot talking about that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=202.68s)]
*  I mean, obviously this is our neighbor to the north and it was a very interesting dynamic. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=205.04s)]
*  I mean, really, you know, debatably like the largest freedom protests in modern America. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=209.84s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=218.56s)]
*  There I go again, making it American, but in recent history. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=219.56s)]
*  And of course, the government crackdown of that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=223.68s)]
*  Like there have been things that are kind of interesting. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=225.24s)]
*  And I do want to just preface by saying that, you know, I don't know that much about like [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  Canadian internal politics and it is difficult. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  Even though Canada is our neighbor, there is a distinct culture. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  There is a different politics up there than there is down here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=246.36s)]
*  Nicer people, dumber politics. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=250.12s)]
*  That's how I would sum it up. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=251.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=254.12s)]
*  And there's some connection between those two, by the way, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=255.12s)]
*  Like there's almost like, you know, a weakness that comes along with the kindness there. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=258.16s)]
*  But anyway, so if you guys aren't paying attention, evidently, or not evidently, the liberals [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=266.24s)]
*  had a big victory yesterday. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  And there's several things that are kind of interesting about this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=278.04s)]
*  Again, obviously, neither one of us are nearly as fluent in Canadian politics as American [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=283.04s)]
*  politics. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=289.56s)]
*  And I know I have been accused before, and it's probably true to some degree that I'm [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  somewhat guilty of making everything about America. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=295.88s)]
*  You know, there's a reason for that, though. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=301.6s)]
*  I mean, largely, I think it makes sense. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=303.92s)]
*  You know, I focus on the country that I live in. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=306.56s)]
*  And honestly, even when I'm focusing on like Israel, Palestine, it's because the country [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=309.36s)]
*  that I live in is so implicated in this conflict. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=314.32s)]
*  And you know, like it's a, you know, it's number one, that just makes sense to me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  America is what I really care about. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=326.88s)]
*  I have two little children and I do not plan on leaving this country. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=328.72s)]
*  So like my children are going to grow up in this country. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=333.24s)]
*  And what I care about much more than anything else is what kind of country they're growing [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=336.2s)]
*  up in. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  I remember Noam Chomsky had this old line. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  He was something like, which I always thought was, he was talking about how, and this is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=346.8s)]
*  all true, by the way, but that there was like, you know, there was during the Cold War, there [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=352.52s)]
*  was a ton of like Soviet propaganda about how racist America was. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=357.24s)]
*  And we're talking like right in the aftermath of World War II. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=363.0s)]
*  So like late 40s, early 50s, they would talk about, you know, segregation and how horrible [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=365.36s)]
*  Americans treat black people in the deep south and things like this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=371.16s)]
*  Now, okay, all of that was true. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=374.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=377.56s)]
*  Like they weren't making it up. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=378.56s)]
*  It was a real thing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=379.56s)]
*  But you could also like look at that and be like, really Joseph Stalin? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=380.56s)]
*  Like that's your deal is that you're focusing on how far as you're, you know, like throwing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=384.72s)]
*  people in gulags. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=388.72s)]
*  You're talking about how awful it is. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=390.14s)]
*  There's an interesting game that people can play where they always want to focus on the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=392.92s)]
*  crimes of others rather than the crimes of their own society and therefore somehow kind [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=397.12s)]
*  of like, you know, skirt their own responsibility. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  It's you see this all the time. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=404.36s)]
*  Almost everybody I've ever debated on foreign policy is guilty of this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=407.24s)]
*  It's all day they want to talk about Hamas or Hezbollah or Vladimir Putin or, you know, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=410.68s)]
*  these horrible crimes that other governments commit. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=416.36s)]
*  And then you've got to sit there and be like, yeah, but like, okay, but what is our government [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  done? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=423.6s)]
*  So I do think as a general starting point, it's good to focus most on your own society. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=424.6s)]
*  Then on top of that, you know, we just happen to live under the world empire. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=431.64000000000004s)]
*  Like our government happens to be the most powerful government that's ever existed. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=436.04s)]
*  So it just makes sense. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=439.42s)]
*  In this case with these Canadian elections, I really don't think I'm being American centric [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=441.88s)]
*  or I'm overplaying how much of an impact American politics had on this result. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=449.96s)]
*  And I do think it's something that is important enough to think about. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=456.76s)]
*  And when I say this, like, literally, all of including the biggest campaign ads and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=464.24s)]
*  the victory speech were all about Donald Trump. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=473.72s)]
*  And so essentially, from my understanding is basically this. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=479.2s)]
*  The liberals have dominated Canada, Canadian politics for quite a while now. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=483.76s)]
*  And of course, Justin Trudeau was like the poster child of this. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=490.42s)]
*  He was there, Obama down to the blackface. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=495.14000000000004s)]
*  They were basically the same. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=500.42s)]
*  And this was essentially everything, everything that you could think of during the rise of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=503.54s)]
*  what is now known as wokeism in America, a social justice warrior kind of Democrat type [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=511.58000000000004s)]
*  shit. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=517.54s)]
*  Canada was always a couple clicks to the left of us on that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=519.7s)]
*  If we were the transgender kind of stuff that really rose up over the last 13 years or so, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=524.46s)]
*  15 years, Canada was like straight up, they were having the Bill C-16 that Jordan Peterson [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=535.22s)]
*  rose to fame opposing was like mandating speech, like mandating that you have to call trans [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=541.5200000000001s)]
*  people by one of their 72 different genders or whatever. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=548.76s)]
*  They had there were incidents that I'm sure you remember one comedian who got fined like [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=552.9200000000001s)]
*  three hundred thousand dollars for making an offensive joke. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=560.2s)]
*  They were always like they were several clicks woker than America ever got. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=563.5s)]
*  And this just kind of persisted. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  And it was really it seems like covid kind of broke this and that covid really gave the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=573.08s)]
*  conservatives in Canada like a lifeline because the liberals were in charge and they [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=580.08s)]
*  mismanaged everything. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=586.0400000000001s)]
*  And this old and it really looked to a lot of people. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=587.5200000000001s)]
*  And I've heard from a lot of Canadians that they really thought the liberals were done and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=590.6s)]
*  that they were going to come back and the polling seemed to back that up. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=595.6s)]
*  And then, of course, Trudeau resigned in disgrace and it seemed almost like in a very similar [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=599.04s)]
*  parallel to America in the same way that Obama kind of seemed like almost, you know, this [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=604.68s)]
*  rock star political force that was like so popular. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=611.04s)]
*  And now you see Obama today and everyone just kind of looks at him as like a scammer, like [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=616.1199999999999s)]
*  it's he doesn't have that same like aura anymore. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=620.1199999999999s)]
*  And. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=624.04s)]
*  It does seem, at least according to certainly the campaign ads and the victory speech last [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=625.76s)]
*  night, that what really happened here was that there was a reaction to the stuff Donald [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=631.88s)]
*  Trump's doing. And this is something that I've you know, I've been reading a bit about [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  this this morning. And again, I'm really approaching compared to other issues that I [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=642.52s)]
*  talk about, I'm just much more of a novice on Canadian domestic politics. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=646.16s)]
*  You know, not that I'm an expert on other things, but I have a much deeper, you know, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=652.72s)]
*  understanding of some of these other topics. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=659.68s)]
*  But basically all these Canadian journalists that I'm reading today, they're all saying [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=662.8s)]
*  it's not even the tariffs. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=667.84s)]
*  It was the 51st state thing. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=670.8s)]
*  And that really struck a nerve with a lot of Canadians. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=673.8s)]
*  And you know how these elections work, you know, it's like if you move the middle, a [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=677.92s)]
*  few clicks, that's the difference. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=681.24s)]
*  And people in the middle seem to really respond poorly to the idea that even though [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=683.2s)]
*  he's kind of hiding behind the joke, but then keep saying it and then says he's not [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=689.32s)]
*  joking, they really did not like this idea that they were getting bullied by this this [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=693.6s)]
*  new American president and being talked down to in this way. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=700.96s)]
*  And look, feel however you feel. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=704.2s)]
*  I'm not necessarily saying that therefore Donald Trump shouldn't do something he's [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=707.3199999999999s)]
*  doing. I mean, it's, you know, I kind of am saying that, but it's quite possible that [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=711.4s)]
*  this behavior from Donald Trump just took our neighbor to the north from actually moving [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=716.88s)]
*  in a much more positive direction and sent them back into the opposite direction that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=722.56s)]
*  even Donald Trump would want to say. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=727.28s)]
*  So I do just think just to start off, I think there's something and I'll let you jump in [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=729.04s)]
*  here, Robin, give your thoughts. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=733.64s)]
*  But there is something in politics. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=734.68s)]
*  This is something I've noticed a lot over the years where almost everybody, almost [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=736.92s)]
*  everybody has a has has a real issue. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=742.56s)]
*  They have trouble taking into account in their worldview that no matter what political [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=748.4s)]
*  goal you have, there will almost certainly be a counter reaction to that. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=757.8000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, there's some political equivalent of like Isaac Newton's laws of [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=765.4s)]
*  physics, like every reaction has an equal and opposite reaction. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  Like there is just like, you know, it's like it never seemed to me that in the years of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=773.16s)]
*  like, like, woke insanity that any of these like young social justice warriors ever [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=779.4s)]
*  thought to themselves like there's going to be a snap back to this. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=785.76s)]
*  Like if we push this much radical change this quickly, there will be a counter movement. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  There will be a resistance to this. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=795.04s)]
*  And I think that's that's true for liberals and conservatives, left wingers and right [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=796.88s)]
*  wingers. But I just think it's a very because it's like it's a higher order of thinking. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=801.8s)]
*  It's much easier to just think about the policy you're trying to get into play right [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  now. This is also something I've been thinking about because I'm getting ready to do [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=811.12s)]
*  an immigration debate at the Soho Forum coming up in a couple of weeks. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=815.68s)]
*  And it's one of my you know, one of the things I think about a lot with immigration for [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=821.0799999999999s)]
*  people who advocate for like open borders, you're like, well, what do you think the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=824.9599999999999s)]
*  reaction to that would actually be like, you know, like have you thought that through? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=828.0s)]
*  Have you considered that? But it does seem to me and at least again, this is what I'm [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=833.0s)]
*  reading from Canadian journalists and pollsters and stuff that it does seem that like [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=837.7199999999999s)]
*  that's what we just saw in Canada was that there was a counter reaction to Donald Trump's [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=841.76s)]
*  tariff policy and 51st state rhetoric. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=846.92s)]
*  Any thoughts on this, Rob? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=850.5999999999999s)]
*  Feel free to think Canada can vote in whoever they want because they're going to end up [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=851.88s)]
*  under Donald Trump's rule anyway. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=855.56s)]
*  So, you know, what does it matter? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=857.4s)]
*  Fifty first date. I I think I listen, I don't love Donald Trump's tariff policy. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=859.0799999999999s)]
*  But, you know, if Donald Trump's lunacy pushes other countries to elect leaders to try [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=867.3199999999999s)]
*  and, you know, be more at odds with Trump, whatever. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=873.64s)]
*  I and Donald Trump does have a way of bullying people. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=877.92s)]
*  And I'm not listen, I'm not forecasting this to be a win, particularly in our trade with [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  Canada. I think we get a lot of cheap energy from them. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=885.76s)]
*  And that's where most of the Canada trade surplus comes from. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=888.52s)]
*  And so I don't know that pushing for a change in arrangements with Canada is even a win [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=893.52s)]
*  for our country. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=898.76s)]
*  But the way those idiots up there want to vote and bring back Trudeau or whatnot because [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=900.4s)]
*  they're annoyed with Trump, it's just it's not on my list of criticisms of Trump. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=904.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, I certainly understand that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=909.88s)]
*  As I prefaced at the beginning, Canada is not that important. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=911.52s)]
*  But it does it does suck for the decent people under up there that they're going to have [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=916.12s)]
*  to live under this government again, although, you know, that is that is the way it works. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=920.56s)]
*  By the way, did you see this is a kind of separate point from Canada? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=924.92s)]
*  It's such a it's like Trump just has a different strategy for playing the game. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=931.0s)]
*  And to say, hey, if Donald Trump had more diplomacy, look at what would be going on [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=936.16s)]
*  in other countries. It's like, you know, so he might he might have lost the Canada. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=941.8s)]
*  He might win another one. I don't know. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=945.88s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's that's fair. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  That's a fair point. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=949.3599999999999s)]
*  On the tariff stuff, did you see this rub that and I didn't even have this on my list of [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  things to talk about today, but it just popped into my mind as we were talking about the tariff stuff. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=956.1999999999999s)]
*  Did you see the the back and forth between Bezos and the Trump administration on what [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=960.04s)]
*  Amazon's doing here? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=965.4s)]
*  You know, I got to say this just because look, when it comes to like. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=966.8s)]
*  Jeff Bezos versus Donald Trump, my my dog in the fight is like, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=973.52s)]
*  I tend to want to side with Donald Trump, generally speaking. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=980.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. You know, I don't like Jeff Bezos and I really don't like him as a political [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=984.0799999999999s)]
*  figure. I think the Washington Post was tremendously degraded under his leadership. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=988.8s)]
*  But like, essentially what happened is like Amazon said that they're going to like [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=994.68s)]
*  basically show you in the price what part of it is from the tariffs. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1001.3599999999999s)]
*  And then the White House is flipping out about how this is an attack on the Trump administration [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1006.24s)]
*  and all of this. And I'm just looking at it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1010.4s)]
*  I'm like, I just really don't see how the administration has a leg to stand on here. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1011.92s)]
*  That just seems like a totally reasonable thing for Amazon to do. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1016.84s)]
*  Like if you're enacting a policy that is forcing their prices to rise for them to just point [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1019.6s)]
*  out this percentage of it is because of the tariff policy, like they're putting a tax on the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1025.04s)]
*  stuff that we're selling to you. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1030.0s)]
*  So we have to raise our prices. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1031.4s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what's the counter to this. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1033.64s)]
*  I'm just like, that seems totally reasonable. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1035.76s)]
*  It'd be like objecting to like somebody breaking down the tax on your bill of anything. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1038.32s)]
*  Would we do that with lots of different bills? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1045.4s)]
*  And I don't see any like if you were furious at a hotel for saying like, oh, the room is [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1047.8799999999999s)]
*  250 bucks plus 30 dollars in tax. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1053.8s)]
*  And you were like, just say two hundred and eighty dollars. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1056.6s)]
*  You're not allowed to say that or whatever. You know what I mean? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1058.6s)]
*  It's like this just seems silly. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1060.68s)]
*  So I actually have a bunch to say on this. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1063.28s)]
*  I was talking to a buddy of mine this morning and I do think that there is a great opportunity [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1065.16s)]
*  in the market right now for someone to create a Amazon like website that only sells [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1070.72s)]
*  American made products and gives consumers an opportunity to know that things are made in [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1076.28s)]
*  America. Now, when it comes to Amazon letting you know the price increases because of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1080.96s)]
*  tariffs, first is I think the regime did quite well with Amazon and that it disguised a lot of [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1086.68s)]
*  the inflation that would have existed in the market by being able to make use of cheaper [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1092.96s)]
*  foreign labor and importing goods that otherwise would have increased more substantially in [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1098.2s)]
*  price. And they might be cheaper goods. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1102.8000000000002s)]
*  They might be goods that don't last as long and that are of the same quality. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1104.64s)]
*  But I believe that foreign manufacturing has helped the regime disguise what would [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1108.6000000000001s)]
*  otherwise be a larger tariff problem in terms of them turning around to Amazon and saying [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1113.04s)]
*  that this is what like they were they didn't quite use the word treason, but they were [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1118.92s)]
*  using it was pretty strong language. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1122.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, very aggressive language of them undermining the regime. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1124.68s)]
*  I was reading this book for a while and it didn't really quite grab my interest, but it's [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1127.92s)]
*  called Propaganda and it was from like Freud's, I think, son or grandson. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1131.72s)]
*  Bernays, Edward Bernays. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1135.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's a really good book. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1137.5600000000002s)]
*  So I read it on plane rides over the course of too long for how short of a book it was. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1139.2800000000002s)]
*  But there was one piece in there. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1144.4s)]
*  This was prior to the Donald Trump tariffs where he was taught where the author was [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1145.44s)]
*  talking about how to sell the American public on the tariffs are bad. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1148.92s)]
*  And one of it was like a department store that had dual pricing of like the with tariff [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  pricing. And I was almost surprised that a brand hadn't done that yet and that this is [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1158.0s)]
*  a very good way to educate customers or the voting public for, hey, here's the cost [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1162.72s)]
*  of tariffs and this is what this is now going to cost you. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1168.04s)]
*  I'm surprised that somebody hasn't done that sooner. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1171.0s)]
*  I think Amazon is, you know, people are trying to complain, oh, well, why didn't why [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1173.52s)]
*  didn't they do that during Biden's inflation? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1178.36s)]
*  Well, too, that's not just Biden's inflation. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1181.28s)]
*  A lot of that came from Donald Trump's policies during covid of shutting down and sending [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1183.6799999999998s)]
*  money to consumers. That wasn't just Biden. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1188.24s)]
*  And this someone has to fact check me on if you're in the business of cheap goods. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1190.9599999999998s)]
*  I don't know that inflation is definitely bad for your business. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1195.8799999999999s)]
*  Like, I don't know that Amazon is killed by inflation because they're the provider of [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1199.52s)]
*  the cheaper goods and services. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1204.28s)]
*  They might actually pick up customers and make better use of the supply lines. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1205.72s)]
*  I don't know that. So in other words, they're advertising something that actually [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1209.84s)]
*  affects their business model, which is tariffs. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1213.52s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Not the same thing as them advertising [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1216.24s)]
*  price increases because of inflation. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1221.76s)]
*  I don't I don't see them being as that. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1224.0s)]
*  That to me is not a consistent criticism. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1227.0s)]
*  And I think just to put a point on it, the Donald Trump administration [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1229.3999999999999s)]
*  criticizing them for pointing out, hey, this new policy from the government [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1233.36s)]
*  is increasing your cost of goods. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1238.32s)]
*  Seems like fair play to me. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1240.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's a lot of interesting points there. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1241.6399999999999s)]
*  And on that point about whether price inflation actually helps Amazon, I mean, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1244.48s)]
*  I guess we'd need Gene Epstein or Bob Murphy maybe to like school us on on one of these. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1248.8799999999999s)]
*  But I will say that this is somewhat anecdotal, but I think it gets to the point. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1253.12s)]
*  But like I know in in my town where I live, I know there are three, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1256.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, what you would call mom and pop stores that have been here for, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1263.6000000000001s)]
*  I believe all of them were around at least 30 years that have closed [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1267.52s)]
*  in the last two years. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1272.64s)]
*  Like I knew there was like a shoe cobbler and there was a toy store [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1273.92s)]
*  and a bookstore and all of them closed in the last few years. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1278.3600000000001s)]
*  And so I do think it's like, yeah, I think that's who really gets screwed. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1282.64s)]
*  By the price inflation is like we all kind of know, like, you know, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1286.48s)]
*  there are these kind of like nice little neighborhood stores [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1289.72s)]
*  that just don't have the economies of scale of these giant, you know, companies. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1292.3999999999999s)]
*  And they got to charge a few bucks more for every product. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1296.56s)]
*  And typically people kind of know that, but they like supporting their local store [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1299.92s)]
*  and they think it adds to the charm of the town or whatever. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1305.32s)]
*  But when you have areas of high price inflation, like when people's like, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1308.68s)]
*  you know, if your mortgage is going up and your energy costs are going up [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1312.36s)]
*  and your car payments are going up and your groceries are going up, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1316.56s)]
*  it just puts a lot more people are like, yeah, if we got to get toys for the kids, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1320.56s)]
*  I'm going to order them on Amazon because they're just going to be cheaper. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1323.9599999999998s)]
*  You know, it's like you got to find ways to cut where you can. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1327.0s)]
*  And you could directly see these these small businesses just like could not, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1330.52s)]
*  you know, figure out a way to make that work. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1335.4399999999998s)]
*  And so at least in that example, it does seem to kind of back up [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1337.32s)]
*  what you're saying that like, oh, no, it's good for Amazon [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1340.64s)]
*  because they're the cheap alternative. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1343.0400000000002s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1345.68s)]
*  which is Monetary Metals, a phenomenal company. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1348.88s)]
*  I've been telling you guys about for a while. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1351.68s)]
*  If you own gold, you've probably been happy to see prices [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1353.76s)]
*  hitting new all time highs over this last year. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1357.3200000000002s)]
*  But your gold can do more than just sit there waiting for the price to go up. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1360.3200000000002s)]
*  It can also generate passive income for you now because of Monetary Metals. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1364.1200000000001s)]
*  You can earn up to five percent interest on your gold and silver [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1368.72s)]
*  paid in more ounces of metal and accredited investors can even achieve [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1371.8799999999999s)]
*  double digit returns in their bond offerings. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1376.24s)]
*  All interest payments are made in ounces of gold and silver [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1378.72s)]
*  stored in your account free of charge. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1382.2s)]
*  Whether your metal is gathering dust at home or costing you annual storage fees, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1385.24s)]
*  it's time to stop paying to own gold and start getting paid to own it [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1389.6s)]
*  and put it to work with Monetary Metals. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1394.08s)]
*  Go check them out at Monetary-Metals.com to learn more about how you can start [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1396.5600000000002s)]
*  growing your wealth in ounces today once more. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1401.88s)]
*  That's Monetary-Metals.com. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1404.8400000000001s)]
*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1408.2s)]
*  You know, your example or your point about like a department store [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1411.0s)]
*  doing it or something like that is that you're right. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1415.3200000000002s)]
*  I completely agree. It's almost surprising more haven't done it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1417.1200000000001s)]
*  But Amazon doing it is just so devastating [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1420.5600000000002s)]
*  because it is like the biggest goddamn virtual store that almost everybody uses now. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1423.84s)]
*  And look, again, it's like, I don't know. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1431.04s)]
*  I think the administration is in a weird spot where they're just basically going, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1434.48s)]
*  like, don't let people know about this bad economic policy. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1438.6799999999998s)]
*  Don't let them know that this is the reason prices are going up. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1442.8799999999999s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1446.6799999999998s)]
*  That to me seems. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1448.3999999999999s)]
*  Pretty. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1450.76s)]
*  Pretty weak. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1453.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just a really weak argument. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1454.4s)]
*  I don't understand what like it. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1456.28s)]
*  I'm just saying, like, if you were going to make this argument, wouldn't you also have to say [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1459.76s)]
*  that it's again, they didn't use the word treason, but I read, you know, they did use very strong language. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1464.56s)]
*  And it was like, would you say the same thing about a hotel? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1469.32s)]
*  Every hotel room I ever got, or I think just about all of them, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1472.1200000000001s)]
*  they always show you what the tax costs, you know, are they also? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1476.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, like in defiance of the state government or something like that, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1481.24s)]
*  because they're letting you know that this part of the price is artificially imposed by the government. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1485.44s)]
*  Are they not allowed to let you know that, like, even if you defend the taxes on hotel rooms, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1492.8s)]
*  that is still what's accounting for this raise in pricing. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1499.28s)]
*  And so why should we not know this? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1502.4s)]
*  Like, is your argument somehow that like, this is a good policy? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1504.16s)]
*  You know, you're he's he's bragging on one hand about the revenue that it's going to generate. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1507.96s)]
*  But then, like, you're not allowed to point out where that generated revenue is coming from. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1513.0800000000002s)]
*  This is just too nutty to me. I don't know. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1520.0400000000002s)]
*  So I just really it's just one of those things where it's like. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1522.5600000000002s)]
*  It just seems like a really bad fight for the administration to pick, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1526.2800000000002s)]
*  especially when over the years, when Donald Trump was crashing Bezos, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1530.2800000000002s)]
*  he was doing it from the position of having the, you know, the the moral high ground, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1536.76s)]
*  you know, trash in the Washington Post for running all these articles about the Russiagate nonsense. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1546.3999999999999s)]
*  It was totally just humiliating. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1551.0s)]
*  I mean, all of Washington Post and the New York Times, you know, we probably give [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1552.84s)]
*  we probably give over the years we've given like CNN and NBC more shit [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1556.8s)]
*  because they're they're so much more egregious in the way that they would cover it. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1562.88s)]
*  But the Washington Post and the New York Times just totally, I mean, like [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1566.8400000000001s)]
*  severely degraded their own reputation on the Russiagate stuff. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1573.3200000000002s)]
*  Just totally, you know, like they ran with the story, too, and never. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1579.0800000000002s)]
*  Then it was such an opportunity for either of those papers to blow the lid open on the whole thing, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1582.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, and just be like, you know, this is all this is all complete horseshit. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1588.3600000000001s)]
*  It was all right there in front of us. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1592.2s)]
*  There's no reason why me and you could do it. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1593.72s)]
*  And nobody at the Washington Post or the New York Times could other than they didn't want to. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1595.96s)]
*  But so when Donald Trump was trash trash and Jeff Bezos for running a fucking propaganda rag, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1600.28s)]
*  he was doing it with the moral high ground. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1606.32s)]
*  But now he's trashing them for letting the consumers know where the increase in prices come from. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1608.4s)]
*  I don't know. I can't really get behind that. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1615.48s)]
*  Just seems to too ridiculous. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1618.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1621.8799999999999s)]
*  OK, all right. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1623.28s)]
*  Moving on to the let's get into this because this is an interesting topic. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1625.08s)]
*  There were articles of impeachment were introduced against Donald Trump. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1630.2s)]
*  Shocker. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1638.96s)]
*  This is it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1640.9199999999998s)]
*  It really is. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1642.96s)]
*  I don't know, Rob. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1644.1599999999999s)]
*  It's I'm curious to get your thoughts on this, but I find this kind of. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1644.8s)]
*  There's a lot of things that are hilarious about this. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1649.32s)]
*  And before we play this video, I just wanted to be clear. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1651.0s)]
*  I'm not going for the cheapest joke here alone. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1654.2s)]
*  We will probably cover that, too. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1659.52s)]
*  But there is a broader point to this. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1661.96s)]
*  But I guess I would just preface even before we get into this this video. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1664.12s)]
*  There is an unbelievable dynamic that's been at work between like, you know, you have the [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1670.72s)]
*  corporate media and the Democrat Democratic Party basically one, you know, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1677.16s)]
*  apparatus and verse Donald Trump has basically been going on since 2016. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1682.56s)]
*  It is amazing, amazing. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1691.16s)]
*  The ability that the that the Democrats and the corporate media have to snatch [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1694.8s)]
*  defeat from the jaws of victory. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1701.68s)]
*  It's like as soon as Donald Trump does something where you're like, oh, he played [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1704.64s)]
*  it bad there, this is a weak move for him. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1709.0s)]
*  They go, hold my beer. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1711.48s)]
*  We will over dramatize this and make complete fools out of ourselves while doing [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1713.8000000000002s)]
*  it to the point that he'll start looking better. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1718.3600000000001s)]
*  Like it's just always the dynamic constantly. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1721.48s)]
*  Um, and so, you know, we were saying like, yeah, you know, the way Donald Trump is [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1724.4s)]
*  going about these deportations sure does seem to be like the dumbest way to do it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1728.64s)]
*  It sure does seem to be the way that's going to get the most pushback and the least [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1734.16s)]
*  amount of illegals actually deported. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1738.16s)]
*  Like what the fuck is the strategy here? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1740.88s)]
*  But then there's this, it's like to introduce articles of impeachment over the [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1743.16s)]
*  case of a guy, it just seems to me to be like, look, dude, I don't know how to say [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1748.44s)]
*  this. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1758.3999999999999s)]
*  If tone deaf was a clip, the clip we're about to play is the personification of [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1758.7199999999998s)]
*  tone deafness. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1766.1999999999998s)]
*  Just nothing. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1767.9199999999998s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1768.6799999999998s)]
*  You get like literally the, um, what is it? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1769.6799999999998s)]
*  I sent the, in a video, uh, it was from chief nerd, great Twitter account to go [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1772.6799999999998s)]
*  follow, uh, but he, he posted this and just said, this is not a Saturday night [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1777.12s)]
*  live sketch. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1782.12s)]
*  Um, it is, uh, here's the video of a democratic rep, Shiri, uh, ton of [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1783.52s)]
*  dar, ton of dar, um, on why he's introduced articles of impeachment. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1789.04s)]
*  This is Congressman Shri Tana Dar. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1795.96s)]
*  Donald Trump has already done real damage to our democracy, but defying a [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1798.72s)]
*  unanimous nine or Supreme court ruling that has to be the final straw is time. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1804.6s)]
*  We impeached Donald J. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1810.76s)]
*  Trump. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1812.96s)]
*  The court said the wrongfully deported Kilmer Garcia must be allowed to return [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1813.84s)]
*  and receive due process. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1819.48s)]
*  Trump ignored it. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1821.68s)]
*  He ignored the constitution. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1823.4s)]
*  He ignored the very checks and balances that keep our democracy intact. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1825.6s)]
*  This isn't an isolated incident. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1831.68s)]
*  It's part of a dangerous deliberate pattern. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1834.0s)]
*  That's why today I introduced a resolution to impeach Donald J. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1837.52s)]
*  Trump outlining seven articles of impeachment article one obstruction of [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1844.24s)]
*  justice and abuse of executive power. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1853.4s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1856.48s)]

*  Japanese culture allowed me to move there like there was a legal pathway [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=1999.76s)]
*  where I could go live there now and I wanted to live there because I thought it [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2003.72s)]
*  was a better place to have a life for my family and my kids. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2006.64s)]

*  and that's fine. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2020.08s)]
*  There's a whole lot of people who came here illegally and we do not allow that [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2020.96s)]
*  like we get to choose who comes and doesn't come and we want the people who [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2024.56s)]
*  came here illegally to get out and someone was like I think it's really wrong [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2027.44s)]

*  You should lead the charge against this. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2033.04s)]
*  I'd be like no dude I can't lead the charge against this. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2035.28s)]
*  Like maybe I'll support you and your effort if I don't agree with the policy [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2038.92s)]
*  but like obviously I can't be the one to do that because you guys just let me in [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2042.76s)]
*  here. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2047.88s)]
*  Like what this is crazy. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2048.56s)]
*  It's absolute madness and it really does. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2050.56s)]
*  It kind of it just gets to like the fact that there's a much bigger picture here [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2055.64s)]
*  especially when it comes to immigration more broadly. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2062.28s)]
*  And the reason why like immigration is has become one of if not the biggest [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2066.7599999999998s)]
*  issue across the West not just in the United States of America this is all [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2075.72s)]
*  throughout the West. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2081.08s)]
*  Immigration is one of if not the biggest issue and there's a reason for that. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2082.04s)]
*  And like when you kind of zoom out and you look at it there's look for for many [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2086.56s)]
*  years in America obviously like as people kind of know like the caricatured [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2094.68s)]
*  version of American history is this kind of like we're a nation of immigrants. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2099.48s)]
*  We're all descendants of immigrants and there is some truth to that. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2104.72s)]
*  Like there were huge waves of immigration into America. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  But you know like the truth is that if you actually look at American history it's [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2113.68s)]
*  much more like it's much more like a chart that ebbs and flows like there were [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2119.96s)]
*  big waves of immigration and then there were there were periods of time with very [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2125.2400000000002s)]
*  low numbers of immigration and essentially pre before 1965 I believe it [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2129.28s)]
*  was 65 double check me on this but I believe in the immigration act in 1965 is [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2139.0s)]
*  what really altered like the way immigration is done. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2145.32s)]
*  There it used to be before that period that the government explicitly gave favor to [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2149.52s)]
*  European and Christian countries that were immigrating here. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2155.92s)]
*  And this is part of the reason why we had giant waves of immigration from Ireland [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2160.36s)]
*  and Italy and you know places in Europe and not from South America. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2165.52s)]
*  That changed in the mid 60s. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2172.6000000000004s)]
*  And now I again you'd have to go check the numbers but for for a long time now I [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2175.2400000000002s)]
*  mean immigration is overwhelmingly I mean I think it's 80 plus percent is like you [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2181.0800000000004s)]
*  know from third world countries and it's you know brown people of different types. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2187.4s)]
*  Now I'm not nothing against brown people nothing against their world countries. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2193.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm just saying like this is how the immigration policy changed. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2197.0s)]
*  And the thing about it is right is that the American people never supported it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2200.36s)]
*  Ever you know in 1965 I know that Ted Kennedy I believe was one of the people [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2210.44s)]
*  leading the charge for the 65 immigration act and the way he sold it was by [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2216.48s)]
*  explicitly saying that this will not change the racial composition of America. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2220.76s)]
*  That was how he sold it in the mid 60s. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2225.72s)]
*  Now he was lying through his teeth. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2228.8799999999997s)]
*  That's not actually what ended up happening. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2230.52s)]
*  But I'm just making the point that there's never been a time where there was a vote [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2232.4399999999996s)]
*  on this or where the American people were asked and said like hey do you wish to [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2237.3199999999997s)]
*  radically and drastically change the racial and cultural composition of the [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2242.56s)]
*  United States of America. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2246.68s)]
*  And if they ever had been it would have been a very resounding no. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2248.08s)]
*  And that's why Ted Kennedy had to sell this as it's not going to be that because [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2251.92s)]
*  look think about it like this right. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2258.16s)]
*  So in the year we're talking about the 60s here. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2260.24s)]
*  OK. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2263.4s)]
*  So in 1960 the country the racial dynamics of the country where the country was 90 [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2263.92s)]
*  percent white 9 percent black 1 percent other something right around those [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2270.68s)]
*  numbers. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2276.92s)]
*  I mean I have that exactly right. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2277.2s)]
*  But it's very very close to that. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2278.28s)]
*  And OK. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2280.0s)]
*  You essentially had a bi-racial country not a multiracial country a bi-racial [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2281.1600000000003s)]
*  country. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2287.08s)]
*  And what is what do we all know. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2287.96s)]
*  Like what is the biggest story of the 1960s. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2290.2400000000002s)]
*  Civil rights movement. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2294.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2295.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean like it was already in that environment. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2296.28s)]
*  There were major conflicts and problems that were a result of having a bi-racial [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2298.88s)]
*  country. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2304.96s)]
*  Now that's not to blame anybody. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2305.92s)]
*  That's not to say like. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2308.2s)]
*  And by the way the black people were the victims in this scenario. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2309.2s)]
*  I'm not blaming them for the racial. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2312.56s)]
*  I'm just saying it is something that comes along with having more than what with [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2314.7999999999997s)]
*  having a non-hamajane. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2319.16s)]
*  What am I saying. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2323.64s)]
*  Yes there you go. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2325.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm saying like there are there are issues that come along with [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2327.36s)]
*  that. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2329.68s)]
*  And then if you're talking about like drastically changing the there's issues [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2330.08s)]
*  that come along with that. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2334.24s)]
*  And the people never supported this. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2335.64s)]
*  No one ever said they wanted it. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2337.88s)]
*  And in fact we've seen just over the last four years how unpopular huge amounts of [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2339.52s)]
*  unfettered immigration is. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2344.12s)]
*  And you know just in terms of the optics I'm not even talking about the case. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2345.92s)]
*  I mean we could get into that you could give your thoughts on that. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2350.7599999999998s)]
*  But just in terms of the optics of like having somebody who speaks like a foreigner [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2352.68s)]
*  lecture you about how the president who just won every swing state and the popular [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2359.2s)]
*  vote can't go through on his immigration policy. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2364.12s)]
*  It's just like dude look there is there's a lot of dynamics going on here. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2368.12s)]
*  There's a lot happening. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2374.72s)]
*  But on top of all of that right. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2376.16s)]
*  But you could look up the the like census projections and stuff like that and like [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2377.7999999999997s)]
*  America I think is supposed to be a majority minority country in the next couple [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2383.3599999999997s)]
*  decades. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2389.64s)]
*  And I think ultimately we're going to be a majority Hispanic country. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2390.92s)]
*  No that's a big change. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2394.64s)]
*  You might be all for it. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2396.3199999999997s)]
*  You know you might think that's great. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2397.8399999999997s)]
*  And maybe there's an argument for why that's a good change. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2399.92s)]
*  I don't know to be honest what that argument is but like maybe you think that's [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2403.3199999999997s)]
*  that's a good thing. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2406.92s)]
*  But it is a drastic change. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2408.16s)]
*  And for all the people who scream so much about democracy yes there's some time [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2410.24s)]
*  between 2041 and 2046 is what Natalie just put in the chat and that's about the [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2415.84s)]
*  way this is not that far off in the future you know as you get older you realize [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2421.7200000000003s)]
*  like that time creeps up pretty quickly. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2425.6800000000003s)]
*  But like even if you think this is an overwhelmingly good thing if you believe [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2427.76s)]
*  in democracy or whatever as many people claim to I'm just saying the people don't [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2433.2000000000003s)]
*  want it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2437.2000000000003s)]
*  If there was a referendum on this tomorrow it would be an 80 20 issue easily. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2438.2400000000002s)]
*  You know like it is not there has been no point for the American people have said [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2442.9599999999996s)]
*  this is what we want. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2447.3199999999997s)]
*  And so while you're doing this OK. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2449.3199999999997s)]
*  And this is true like all across the West. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2453.72s)]
*  I don't think there's any population in the West any white population that's like [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2457.24s)]
*  has a sustainable reproduction rate. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2462.6s)]
*  Like it's all fault you know what I mean. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2464.9599999999996s)]
*  And like OK feel however you feel about that. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2466.68s)]
*  Again as the example that I used to use all the time was like if you went if you [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2470.04s)]
*  go to Italy and you were to say hey guys I've got some fantastic projections OK. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2475.04s)]
*  Italians listen up. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2482.24s)]
*  Look in the next 30 years this isn't going to be an Italian nation anymore. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2484.68s)]
*  Italians will be the minority here it's going to be a mostly French nation. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2492.16s)]
*  Isn't that awesome. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2497.12s)]
*  I think most Italians would go no we don't find that awesome. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2498.96s)]
*  We don't wish to be France. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2503.4s)]
*  We wish to be Italy and that doesn't mean they're racists. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2505.4s)]
*  It doesn't mean like they hate French people or anything like that. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2509.0s)]
*  It just means that like it's a very normal human reaction to be against that. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2512.3199999999997s)]
*  And what you're what you're seeing here right now and this is a huge factor in [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2516.52s)]
*  American politics is that like there OK at the same time as we're looking down [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2521.68s)]
*  and getting closer and closer to the projections of this drastic change there [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2528.16s)]
*  was like from the entire establishment there was this rise in like anti white [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2531.8399999999997s)]
*  racialism where like it in all of like Hollywood in corporate America in [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2538.56s)]
*  academia everything was about demonizing straight white men. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2545.2799999999997s)]
*  We had these kind of like hyper affirmative action DEI policies that are [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2549.4399999999996s)]
*  just openly saying hey we're we're going to through the force of law. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2554.4399999999996s)]
*  We want to see more women of color in positions of power. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2560.0s)]
*  We want to see more black people in positions of power more Latinos in [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2564.8399999999997s)]
*  positions of power more gay people more trans people like with the force of law [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2568.12s)]
*  behind it translated you know in plain English. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2572.64s)]
*  Everyone except straight white men we want to give favor to wall your [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2577.88s)]
*  demographic which is used to being the majority is getting smaller and smaller [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2583.08s)]
*  and smaller. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2588.0s)]
*  Now again to the point that I made earlier could you have predicted that [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2588.88s)]
*  there might be a counter reaction to that. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2592.28s)]
*  That's that a movement that opposes that might rise up. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2594.96s)]
*  And you know I guess essentially what I would say is that all of this all of this [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2598.88s)]
*  stuff whether it's like the declining birth rate or unfettered immigration. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2606.52s)]
*  These are all policies like this. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2613.4s)]
*  This didn't just happen. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2616.8s)]
*  These are because of specific policies that were enacted intentionally by [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2618.6s)]
*  politicians that all of this is happening and there was never a vote on it. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2624.36s)]
*  Never a vote. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2629.64s)]
*  In fact every time there's a referendum at all it goes completely in the other [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2630.6s)]
*  way. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2634.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a Donald Trump. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2635.08s)]
*  Donald Trump winning you know like demonstrates this even people who didn't [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2636.8s)]
*  like Donald Trump very much just like I'm going to vote for this guy because fuck [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2640.7599999999998s)]
*  you know I don't like. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2645.24s)]
*  And so like I just I'm almost like I'm I'm like floored by the optics of this video [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2646.12s)]
*  about introducing articles of impeachment to Donald Trump. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2652.96s)]
*  It's just like bananas to me. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2655.72s)]
*  The like this is why I said it's like if tone deafness was a video clip it would [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2657.56s)]
*  be this. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2661.72s)]
*  It's just like that. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2662.12s)]
*  Read the room man like have some have some understanding of the optics of all of [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2664.6s)]
*  this even if you're for the policy. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2669.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know Rob anything you want to jump in there. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2671.8399999999997s)]
*  It's the same shenanigans where you know you can make the argument for example [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2674.7599999999998s)]
*  when Donald Trump starts telling Amazon that they're not allowed to give [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2679.4s)]
*  consumers information that that's somewhat authoritarian. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2683.3199999999997s)]
*  But then when the Democrats come around and they go listen voting public you [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2688.08s)]
*  can't have the person that you voted in. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2691.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2693.2000000000003s)]
*  And after all these trials and a month after the election we're going to try and [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2693.6000000000004s)]
*  impeach him. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2697.0800000000004s)]
*  That's also cartoonish. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2698.0s)]
*  And the reaction you're going to get to the Democrats once again trying to not [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2700.5600000000004s)]
*  allow him to actually orchestrate his presidency and bogging him down with this [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2705.6400000000003s)]
*  nonsense. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2711.1200000000003s)]
*  It's worse. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2711.76s)]
*  It's what I was talking about the other day. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2712.5600000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump administration throws bullshit at you and then all of a sudden [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2714.2400000000002s)]
*  the Democrats and leftist media throws even bigger bullshit at you and your [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2717.2400000000002s)]
*  not even sure who to be more annoyed with stepping in now with what Donald [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2721.28s)]
*  Trump's done. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2725.6400000000003s)]
*  There's nothing that should be impeachable. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2726.1200000000003s)]
*  There should be no conversation about impeachment. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2728.0400000000004s)]
*  You know it's funny I was going to send this to you as a topic yesterday because [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2731.1200000000003s)]
*  came up with Chuck Schumer that he wasn't going to rule it out. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2735.0400000000004s)]
*  But I was like all right they're not really talking about it. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2737.28s)]
*  It's not even worth discussing. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2739.2400000000002s)]
*  This is the first I'm seeing of someone actually putting it forward. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2740.88s)]
*  So I think conversation from the Democrats about impeachment and impeachment right [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2743.84s)]
*  now is lunacy. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2748.84s)]
*  And then the fact that this guy's a congressman who barely speaks English or [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2750.8s)]
*  doesn't articulate it well for me to be able to follow him. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2754.8s)]
*  The optics of that seem unless I don't know is this guy did he cure cancer in his [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2758.88s)]
*  region. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2763.4s)]
*  And so he's the immigration story of why we need more immigrants. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2764.2000000000003s)]
*  Is there some storyline I don't know right about how this guy is the the savior of [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2767.2400000000002s)]
*  Illinois or some area where he cured the poor and that this is this is why he's [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2771.84s)]
*  the person to lead the charge. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2777.2s)]
*  Or does this guy somehow have a job in our government and doesn't speak English. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2779.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2783.3599999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2783.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2784.56s)]
*  And I'm leaning toward the latter although please prove me wrong if there is some [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2784.8399999999997s)]
*  story like that. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2789.0s)]
*  But yeah you know and of course like this isn't in a vacuum. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2790.08s)]
*  I mean Donald Trump got impeached twice in his first in his first term over just [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2794.16s)]
*  like. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2802.9199999999996s)]
*  Your bullshit like pure bullshit and there's things that Donald Trump did in his [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2803.36s)]
*  first term that you could argue were impeachable offenses. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2808.36s)]
*  But the two things he got impeached for were not them. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2811.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean it's it is insane like he got impeached for. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2814.28s)]
*  What they called a quid pro quo with Zelinsky and the only problem with calling [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2820.96s)]
*  And the only problem with calling it a quid a quid pro quo was that he didn't get [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2828.8s)]
*  anything. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2834.0s)]
*  He didn't get anything. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2836.0800000000004s)]
*  You know a quid pro quo means I give you something if you give me something. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2837.5600000000004s)]
*  He never got anything. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2842.52s)]
*  He he basically called Zelinsky and kind of like you know it was a little like mob [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2843.8s)]
*  type shit like he was like oh you know I want you to look into the Bidens and [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2849.92s)]
*  maybe you don't get these this weapons package that I was going to send to you. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2853.92s)]
*  And then Zelinsky never looked into the Bidens and Donald Trump gave him the [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2857.84s)]
*  weapons. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2861.6000000000004s)]
*  So like there was just absolutely nothing there by the way. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2862.32s)]
*  By the way isn't it fucking crazy that that story gets buried when it's like oh [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2865.0s)]
*  the story is that there was a civil war on the country on Russia's border and [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2868.6400000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump poured weapons into it. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2873.0s)]
*  Hey how'd that end up working out. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2875.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah Russia invaded. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2877.6400000000003s)]
*  Not so good. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2879.28s)]
*  But that's the story there. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2880.44s)]
*  Not that he for a second asked for the very real fucking corruption to be [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2882.04s)]
*  investigated. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2886.76s)]
*  Like it's just whatever is nuts. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2887.92s)]
*  And then the January 6th thing was just ridiculous just totally ridiculous. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2889.6400000000003s)]
*  And so now you're going to you're going to impeach the guy or you're going to you [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2894.32s)]
*  know I don't think this is actually going to you know get take off but you're [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2897.44s)]
*  introducing articles of impeachment over this. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2900.96s)]
*  You know the guy just got back in. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2904.28s)]
*  He was enjoying record high approval ratings. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2907.0s)]
*  His his numbers are coming down now and you think rather than let him continue to [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2909.96s)]
*  hurt himself. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=2915.8s)]

*  All right. Let's get back into the show. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3010.88s)]
*  I was just going to say in those calls he was slick enough to say can you [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3013.44s)]
*  investigate crimes and say can you create a crime. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3017.1200000000003s)]
*  Can you fabricate evidence. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3019.76s)]
*  That's right. Evidence. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3020.92s)]
*  And then if you flash forward to the fact that the Biden administration actually [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3022.2000000000003s)]
*  ran five court cases against Donald Trump which goes beyond just trying to [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3025.2s)]
*  investigate crimes. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3030.12s)]
*  I mean what they did to Donald Trump was a lot dirtier and it was with our own [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3031.52s)]
*  court system. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3036.7599999999998s)]
*  So I have a lunacy of that particular claim against Donald Trump. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3037.7599999999998s)]
*  And he did the same thing also in Atlanta where he was like can you look in and [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3042.92s)]
*  find me the votes. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3046.3599999999997s)]
*  He was the Georgia's right. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3047.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. Great votes. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3049.24s)]
*  He was saying can you go look this over. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3050.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that there was voting fraud here. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3052.16s)]
*  Yes. And I just need you to find this. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3053.88s)]
*  You could argue certainly that both of the phone calls were inappropriate but [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3056.1600000000003s)]
*  there's nothing criminal in either of them. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3062.08s)]
*  You know and yeah like you could argue like hey you're getting into a gray area. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3064.32s)]
*  What you know it was like it reminds me of the do you remember the scene in Wolf [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3068.4s)]
*  of Wall Street where the FBI guys come on his boat and he's talking to the FBI [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3073.2400000000002s)]
*  guy and he's like he's like oh you know it's crazy. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3080.04s)]
*  He's like my my brokers start at two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3082.72s)]
*  if you ever wanted to do it like I can I can give that job to anybody I want to. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3086.64s)]
*  Like if you wanted to get out of being in law enforcement and get into that you [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3090.6s)]
*  could you start making money right away. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3093.68s)]
*  And he was like did you just attempt to bribe a federal officer. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3095.3599999999997s)]
*  And he's like no no no if you read the law that actually is not. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3098.08s)]
*  Then he's right. That's not actually bribing an office. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3101.48s)]
*  You know like now you could argue like you're kind of brushing up against it a [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3103.9199999999996s)]
*  little bit but it's very clearly not a crime. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3107.3599999999997s)]
*  Like they don't get him for that in the movie because that's not a crime. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3109.8399999999997s)]
*  You could say to somebody like hey Pete this is what you make working for me and [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3112.6s)]
*  that's what you make working for the government. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3115.7999999999997s)]
*  What do you think. But that'll try to even come that close if we're being honest. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3117.4s)]
*  And yeah just you know again with all the other stuff taken into account by the [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3122.2s)]
*  way the other thing which I thought was fascinating about that little detail we've [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3126.52s)]
*  talked about over the years that it didn't come out till years later. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3129.88s)]
*  But when Donald Trump made that phone call to Zelinski the FBI was investigating [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3133.2s)]
*  Hunter Biden and partially dealing with his his business in Ukraine. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3138.7999999999997s)]
*  So it's not like to say that it was like on its face corrupt to ask for an [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3146.3599999999997s)]
*  investigation into the shit our government was investigating too. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3152.3999999999996s)]
*  So it's clearly they thought it warranted an investigation. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3155.7599999999998s)]
*  And how amazing is that that there was not one leak by the FBI. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3158.2799999999997s)]
*  You know all these leaks. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3162.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh always you just can't help it. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3164.4399999999996s)]
*  Everything gets leaked. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3166.12s)]
*  But not that one. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3167.16s)]
*  That one they they kept quiet the entire time. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3168.56s)]
*  I also don't think Donald Trump has done anything blatantly criminal in terms of [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3171.96s)]
*  not acting quick enough to bring people back that the Supreme Court asked him to [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3178.16s)]
*  try and bring back. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3183.12s)]
*  I don't think there's any. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3184.56s)]
*  The Supreme Court. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3186.0s)]
*  Yes it's not like the Supreme Court said you're in violation of the law. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3187.4s)]
*  He needs to be brought back right now and it has to happen. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3191.3199999999997s)]
*  It was much vaguer than that. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3194.64s)]
*  Right. Like I remember you were kind of a step away from this conversation in that [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3196.16s)]
*  you know I don't know that I'm going to speak with the most clarity on this but [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3203.2799999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump seems to be escalating these court cases in a way that you might have [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3206.2799999999997s)]
*  courts mandating something from him and then he defies courts and then we have a [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3210.7999999999997s)]
*  new conversation about what happens if the president is openly defying courts. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3215.36s)]
*  And we might get there and that might become a conversation which is almost along [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3220.84s)]
*  the lines of what was taking place the last time of what happens if the president [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3225.04s)]
*  does break the law. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3228.48s)]
*  And you know if there's presidential immunity what happens not that Donald is [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3229.56s)]
*  doing this but what happens if he decides to predator drone political opponent. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3234.7599999999998s)]
*  And then the conversation was well there is a mechanism for that which is [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3238.84s)]
*  impeachment. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3241.8s)]
*  So all of this seems very poll preliminary because Donald Trump I don't think has [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3242.92s)]
*  actually defied a court order yet to have to start having the conversation about [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3247.4s)]
*  the criminality of the president and whether or not I guess there should be an [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3252.52s)]
*  impeachment charge. This is just nonsense that's coming like far too early. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3258.88s)]
*  Yeah. No 100 percent. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3264.56s)]
*  But I just I guess I just can't get over the like the optics of having this guy [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3266.48s)]
*  lead the charge. And you know just to be you know as we talked about a few months [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3272.56s)]
*  back character on an Indian version of Sesame Street. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3278.8s)]
*  I can't yes literally a real guy got a job in government. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3281.2799999999997s)]
*  It's unbelievable. And right. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3284.8799999999997s)]
*  That's unbelievable enough. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3286.2s)]
*  But that he's doing this on the topic of immigration. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3287.56s)]
*  Like I just don't listen to be clear. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3290.96s)]
*  We talked a few months back when the Vicarama Swami had that viral tweet that [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3293.2s)]
*  really seemed to lose him a lot of favor amongst like his base. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3298.96s)]
*  And and he was out of Doe's shortly after. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3303.8799999999997s)]
*  We don't know for sure if those two things were related but that certainly seems [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3306.96s)]
*  like they might have been. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3310.32s)]
*  And I did think while I thought that the vague missed the mark a little bit on [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3312.36s)]
*  that tweet I did think the backlash he received was unfair. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3317.0800000000004s)]
*  And some of it was just like straight out like bigoted. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3322.92s)]
*  And I don't like is the back of the question. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3327.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3332.32s)]
*  I just want to make sure it wasn't coming through the mic. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3333.32s)]
*  I'm not I'm not hearing it at all. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3335.1600000000003s)]
*  But so like I did think it was unfair the backlash he got and like personally like [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3336.76s)]
*  as I've always said I'm not a racialist I don't really like racialism. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3342.6s)]
*  I also I'm just not pretending it's not a factor doesn't exist I think is stupid. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3346.6400000000003s)]
*  But look I don't want if there's any movement that doesn't have room for the [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3351.28s)]
*  Vicarama Swami or Sagar and Jetty or someone like that then fuck that. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3358.48s)]
*  I don't want to be a part of that. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3363.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think those guys are like those guys have been goddamn heroic on so many [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3365.0s)]
*  fucking issues. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3370.28s)]
*  And so like I think it'd be stupid to like you know base things off of like race or [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3371.0800000000004s)]
*  you know not even nationality because they're both American. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3378.8s)]
*  But you know what I mean like ancestry or whatever. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3381.92s)]
*  But there's just something about having this thick of an accent and leading the [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3384.7200000000003s)]
*  charge against immigration restrictions. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3389.0400000000004s)]
*  And I understand you could say technically no he's talking about violating the court [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3392.56s)]
*  but like yeah but what's the whole policy actually over. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3396.08s)]
*  It just seems to me like even you know like you know like when you were when [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3398.96s)]
*  you're younger sometimes people live with like a bunch of roommates or something [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3402.7599999999998s)]
*  like that right. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3406.68s)]
*  Like you'd have a place that has like six people living together like a big [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3407.7999999999997s)]
*  apartment with a bunch of people living in it. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3411.44s)]
*  It's almost like like if one of the rooms opened up and then you asked you were [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBOSBwR1U4&t=3413.52s)]
