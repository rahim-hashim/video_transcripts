*  lined up. I do. Well, I was I filled in for cigar and jetty this morning on breaking points [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=26.86s)]
*  and hosted it with crystal ball. Yeah, I had a full day. I did that first thing in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=33.82s)]
*  morning. They're a morning show. But you know, I'm I'm all up early anyway. So these days, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=39.06s)]
*  I'm not naturally a morning person, but these kids, they really force you to bake. But it [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=45.82s)]
*  was a lot of fun. I think that should be as you guys are listening now, that should be [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  up. They usually they put it up, I think on their site first, like much like kind of the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  way we do it. They put it up on their site, and then it's out on YouTube later. But it [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  was really fun. I really, really enjoyed it. So yeah, go check that out. And then of course, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=62.34s)]
*  tomorrow is the big debate. So I will be debating at the Soho forum. I'm making my return to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=66.74000000000001s)]
*  the Soho forum, which was my, you know, kind of feels like a homecoming. I miss I miss those [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=78.66s)]
*  guys. So looking forward to that. Of course, Robbie, the fire Bernstein will be there opening [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  up the show with some comedy. So some comedy, a debate, and then an after party over at [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=88.02s)]
*  Jane Epstein's place. So looking forward to that. And then [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=93.86s)]
*  Robert dates everybody. Check out the run your mouth podcast. And of course, portstor.com [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  this weekend in DC Jersey in Virginia Beach coming out in the next weekend, a bunch of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=103.7s)]
*  Texas dates and go to portstor.com I'm everywhere this summer, you name a city, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=110.18s)]
*  probably visiting it, go to portstor.com and grab those tickets. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=114.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah, go see and I have consistently heard nothing but great things about the porch tour. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  So make sure you go on out to one of those if they're near you. And then of course, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  me and Rob will also be on tour together. Comic Dave Smith.com for all of those ticket lengths. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=128.9s)]
*  Our next stop is Salt Lake City in Utah party in with the Mormons. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=135.62s)]
*  Were they they were they messed with you? Don't they mess with the beer there or something like [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  that? Right, Rob? Doesn't the beer have less alcohol in it? Yep, they have lower DUI limits [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  and their typical beers, I think like a Budweiser is 5% and there it's like 4.2 or something stupid [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=154.9s)]
*  like that. It's you're just making me drink more beer, Utah. It's not I think you can get normal [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=161.46s)]
*  beers, but it's like your typical Budweiser your Pippicle Miller light all that's been downgraded [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=168.5s)]
*  just a little bit for no reason. I was talking to a guy popping pills anyway. So how's that working [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  out for you? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, it's it's all ridiculous. But dear. Yeah, listen, we like the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=180.66s)]
*  Mormons. But it's this the alcohol thing we really got to talk about as I was talking to this guy [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=187.22s)]
*  who owns like a couple dispensaries out here in in Jersey. And I thought, I don't know, it was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  interesting. He was telling me this, so I didn't know this, but evidently in like in New York, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=201.3s)]
*  you can sell edibles that like whatever dosage, you know, you can get like 10 milligrams or 50 [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=207.62s)]
*  milligrams or 100 milligrams or whatever the THC count in it is. But in Jersey, it's legal. You [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=215.3s)]
*  can have the businesses, but you can only sell 10 milligram edibles. You can't sell any more than that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=221.46s)]
*  And so I, you know, he was telling me this is like the rule in Jersey that of course, my, I thought [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  kind of obvious follow up question. I was like, but can't people just eat more of the gummies? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=233.7s)]
*  And he was like, oh yeah, no, that's what everybody does. And then it was just like a great [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=239.61999999999998s)]
*  little example of like government rules and how stupid they are. But so he goes, he goes, oh, my [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=243.54s)]
*  father is on is on chemo. He goes, and the gummies really help them. Like they really help with his [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=249.22s)]
*  appetite and his sleep and just like not feeling so shitty. And he goes, but he's also diabetic [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=256.02s)]
*  and now he's got to eat five of these gummies instead of one of them. So he's still doing it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=263.3s)]
*  He's still eating the 50 milligrams. So anyway, I don't know. It's just like, for some reason, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=269.78s)]
*  it reminded me of that with the lowering the alcohol level in beer. Like it's like, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=273.62s)]
*  is someone who has a problem just going to be like, ah, too bad. I really, I really would have liked [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=277.94s)]
*  a little bit more alcohol, but I, they only put so much beer. He's just gonna have another beer. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=282.82s)]
*  You're just making them, you're just making people fatter. That's what all of this does [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=287.14s)]
*  is just makes people fatter and equally as impaired as they otherwise would be. But you know, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=291.14s)]
*  government's bad at everything. Okay. So for today's episode, I did think it made sense to get [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=297.78s)]
*  into this. You know, it's we, I guess I've been doing more like response episodes lately than [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=305.53999999999996s)]
*  we typically do. But I do think they're kind of necessary and they seem to get very good [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=316.02s)]
*  numbers. So, you know, whatever, I don't know if this one's going to be quite as, as juicy as some [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=320.98s)]
*  of the other characters, but, uh, Mark Levin did go off, uh, partially on me. I think it was more [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=325.62s)]
*  on Tucker Carlson, but you know, it's anti-Semites. Yes. It's a real problem. I am the Jewish, uh, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=334.18s)]
*  face of anti-Semitism or whatever. I've, uh, taken the Larry elders title and morphed it a little bit [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=344.1s)]
*  but it's kind of hard. Number one, I mean the, the, I'm responding to people who are influential [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=351.06s)]
*  people and they're talking about issues that are, you know, the, the issues that we talk about. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=358.02000000000004s)]
*  And I guess just because over the last, you know, month, my, my profile has been a bit higher, uh, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=363.22s)]
*  than it ever has before. It's just been more often the case that I personally am involved in this, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=368.5s)]
*  but it's really not, you know, and I mean this, um, it's really, it's not about me. It's about the, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=375.22s)]
*  what matters. It's about the argument that's being made here. Um, and it has been, it's just, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=382.1s)]
*  it's been interesting. You know, I was a guy who became, you know, obsessed with politics about [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  20 years ago and you know, it's, it's a, I've seen some people say over the last, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=396.42s)]
*  uh, month or so that, uh, you know, people be like this Dave Smith guy came out of nowhere, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=403.62s)]
*  um, which is I'm sure true from their perspective, but it is a little bit different from my [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=409.22s)]
*  perspective. Like 20 years doesn't feel like out of nowhere, but if you could try to imagine it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=413.3s)]
*  from my perspective, it's kind of, it's a little bizarre when you've got these people who were like [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  huge figures now coming after me, you know, all these years later, like it's a little surreal, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=425.3s)]
*  but it's also been, you know, I think I've, I've talked about this dynamic in the past. Um, and I [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=431.86s)]
*  really felt it when I, when I debated Dennis Prager, um, when I remember going into that debate [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=441.22s)]
*  and, you know, I've, I've debated a bunch of people on Israel already at the point, but I [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=448.66s)]
*  debated like Laura Loomer and Austin Peterson and these people who were like, they just don't [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=452.74s)]
*  really know anything. They're, they're not, they're not readers, you know, and they're like, it, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=459.3s)]
*  it was just kind of like my, my depth of knowledge on the issue just far surpassed theirs. And they, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=466.1s)]
*  and that's just very clear to anyone who watches the debate. And when I was debating Dennis Prager, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=471.3s)]
*  I just kind of felt this pressure. Like I was like this guy, I've been watching this guy on TV, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=477.06s)]
*  since I was a kid. I remember watching him on politically incorrect, Bill Mars old show, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=483.06s)]
*  where I must've been like 16 years old or something like that. The guy has been doing [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=489.06s)]
*  a radio show since I was born. Like he's my entire life. And this is his number one issue. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=493.54s)]
*  As I remember feeling this pressure going into the debate, like, okay, I got to really, I better be [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=499.78000000000003s)]
*  on point. I'm, I'm debating a guy who's been doing this my entire life and I'm debating him on his [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=503.54s)]
*  number one issue, you know? And then like right as the debate started, it was during his opening [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=509.38s)]
*  statement, I was just like, Oh, and I had this realization. And then I was just calm for the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=514.82s)]
*  rest of the thing. And the realization was just simply that he had nothing. Like I just couldn't [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=522.26s)]
*  even believe it. It was like, Oh, he actually, he has nothing. He has no argument to protect, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=528.82s)]
*  to present. And of course the same has been true in all the big debates since then. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=534.5s)]
*  I'm just kind of blown away by how much, Oh, they don't actually have an argument. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=539.46s)]
*  And that was kind of how I felt as, as this happened. But anyway, Mark Levin, I guess still [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=542.98s)]
*  has a radio show and I'm sure there are, there are a decent amount of 80 year olds who still listen [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=547.86s)]
*  to it. But I don't know. You've, I'm sure known who Mark Levin is over the years, Rob, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=553.46s)]
*  So I used to very occasionally listen to Mark Levin on the radio. And I, I mean, very occasionally, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=560.5s)]
*  we're talking about in the years where I was not following politics, but every once in a while, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=568.42s)]
*  I'd be bored on the radio happens to be in the car, I think at 7 P.M. And the first 10 minutes [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=572.3399999999999s)]
*  of Mark Levin, before he started taking calls, he had something interesting to say was usually [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=577.54s)]
*  rooted in his constitutional analysis. And I just thought his voice was hilarious. Like [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=582.74s)]
*  if I was doing a cartoon where you're supposed to turn on the radio and hear someone screaming [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=586.74s)]
*  about war, he's, that's the voice I would cast. And it was always a constant and Mr. President, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=591.38s)]
*  it's an outrage. And that's just the voice that should be coming out of your radio, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=597.62s)]
*  pitching to you that the president's ruining the country and we need to be fighting a war. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=604.18s)]
*  It's like if you had to draw a picture of who that guy should be and create a voice of who [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=608.9s)]
*  it would be that voice. Anyway, Mark Levin has been a long time right wing radio talk, radio host, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=616.1s)]
*  has a show on Fox News. He's kind of, he's one of the biggest, you know, right wing radio guys. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=622.74s)]
*  And for a long time, obviously Rush Limbaugh was always the biggest and him and Hannity, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=628.58s)]
*  I think we're fighting it out for like the number two spot in right wing radio for a long time. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=636.02s)]
*  But for a long time, this is kind of forgotten now, but right wing radio was the only game in [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=640.74s)]
*  town for critics of liberals. And then obviously Fox News blew up, but that was, it was kind of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=649.86s)]
*  like the, you know, these, these terms that they're kind of sound like dinosaur artifacts [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=657.86s)]
*  or something now, but like, you know, the, the liberal media. And so the, which was true, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=663.46s)]
*  but it wasn't just the news. It was everything. Like all, all TV and movies were made in New York [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=669.3000000000001s)]
*  or LA. And so they always inherently just reflected a kind of cultural political bias. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=679.78s)]
*  You know, if you like grew up around my age, like I'm 42, when you grew up the, the, even the big [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=687.4599999999999s)]
*  shows, like things outside of, of politics, but like Seinfeld or friends or, or something like [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=694.5799999999999s)]
*  that, it was all, all of the characters. There was no, there was no religious person. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=703.14s)]
*  No one ever believed in God. There was never a thing. No one went to church. No one went to [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=709.6999999999999s)]
*  temple. Like they, they all had sex out of wedlock. They all, you know what I'm saying? Like, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=715.38s)]
*  it was just like culturally speaking, it was not a conservative world. It was a very [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=722.26s)]
*  secular liberal world. And so right-wing radio became kind of like the thing that they had. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=726.5s)]
*  That was, that was one of their very few outlets. And so he was one of the big guys in that and is [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=734.74s)]
*  still around. I don't know. I don't know like what his ratings are these days, but it's not, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=740.18s)]
*  I'm sure what it used to be. But anyway, he's a part of that kind of Neo con war hawk. He's a [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=747.06s)]
*  George W. Bush conservative, and of course staunchly pro-Israel and shockingly, not a [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=755.14s)]
*  huge fan of me. Never saw that coming. Okay. Anyway, let's, let's get into this and, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=764.02s)]
*  and respond to a little bit of our, our boy here, Mark LeBan. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=771.54s)]
*  The underground command post deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=785.14s)]
*  steel of a non-descript building. We've once again made contact with our leader, Mark LeBan. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=790.98s)]
*  All right. Can you pause it already for a second? I didn't even realize this is it here. Man, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=798.66s)]
*  how much did podcasts just expose how stupid radio is? Isn't it just dumb? You know, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=803.14s)]
*  you really don't need any of that. I remember that intro from 20 years ago. That's funny [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=809.22s)]
*  that it's still going. That is something it's always, why, why was there in radio? First of [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=813.46s)]
*  all, I know like I've done radio a lot over the years, like it's serious studios and stuff. And [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=818.98s)]
*  it is, first of all, it's always, it's so short. There's commercials all the time. You just talk [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=824.6600000000001s)]
*  for like a few minutes and then they're like, okay, take a break. And then there's always this like, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=829.14s)]
*  back in the kids, like why, why you're just cutting into our time. No one's [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=834.4200000000001s)]
*  tuned in to listen to that. Okay. I'm sorry. I should do this. Let's keep playing. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=840.74s)]
*  America Mark LeBan here. Our number 877-381-3811. 877-381-3811. I want to thank you for being here. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=845.7s)]
*  Greatest audience of all audiences. Now I'm here five days a week, three hours a day, Mr. Producer. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=856.9s)]
*  Five days a week, three hours a day. And that's just on radio. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=864.98s)]
*  So a schmuck picks a fight with me. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=871.22s)]
*  Doesn't call me. He's got this sidekick, sort of a, I don't even know who this guy Smith is. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=875.7s)]
*  What was his guess? He's not like an Ed McMahon figure or something. I don't know why all these [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=884.02s)]
*  big time smart hosts always have to have a sidekick or somebody or a guest. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=890.26s)]
*  Guess that's what they need. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=894.34s)]
*  Neo conservatives, ladies and gentlemen, as I was briefly stating, these were mostly, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=898.98s)]
*  it's, it is, it is sort of a, a nebulous term or was, but you can see it would be like the weekly [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=905.86s)]
*  standard where Chatsworth Osborne Jr. actually worked with his good friend Bill Crystal. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=914.42s)]
*  Didn't they find texts or something where he called Trump a dumb F to Mr. Pritz, something [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=920.82s)]
*  like that. If I'm wrong, Chatsburn, you can put a footnote on that one. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=925.38s)]
*  But he thinks he runs foreign policy in America. Anybody who disagrees with him [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=932.58s)]
*  has to be smeared. And he brings in these brilliant experts who rewrite World War II and the Holocaust [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=938.34s)]
*  economists who know history, then apparently comedians. So nobody's ever heard of, certainly [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=944.58s)]
*  I haven't, but that's okay. That's his gig. He can do whatever he wants. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=950.58s)]
*  All right. Let's pause it already for a second. I don't even know. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=955.14s)]
*  Do you get, you get my point about how shocking it is, how they all have nothing, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=958.4200000000001s)]
*  like just what is this? This is just unbelievable to me to watch. It's like, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=963.7s)]
*  all is that. Yeah, I get it. No, I know. Listen, I think it's ridiculous too. I know it's ridiculous [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=968.26s)]
*  that I'm just some comedian who you've never heard of. And yet I'm better at this than all of you. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=981.8599999999999s)]
*  It's insane. I also think it's crazy. Now that we're over that, can you take on anything? I said, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=988.18s)]
*  can you take on one argument? Does it? Why is it necessary every time for this constant poisoning [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=995.0600000000001s)]
*  of the well? I don't even know who this guy is. And then he has the nerve to start this off by [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1000.4200000000001s)]
*  saying anyone who disagrees with you on foreign policy needs to be smeared. Well, what exactly are [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1006.1800000000001s)]
*  you doing? What is this? What is it necessary to open up with a, I guess a comedian knows about [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1014.1s)]
*  history and I don't even know his name. I don't even know who he is. Like, okay. All right. It's [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1021.46s)]
*  like they all, they all have to pretend to not be able to remember the simplest name in the fucking [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1026.9s)]
*  world. Like every one of them, not one of you can get Dave, right? Like not one of you to figure out [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1033.7s)]
*  Dave, it's a biblical name, Mark Levin. It's a pretty common one. The last one is like my last [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1042.66s)]
*  name is a little bit tricky. It's hard to pronounce, but it is just so it isn't it kind of like, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1050.02s)]
*  I don't know. It's very, it's revealing in a sense. I mean, I've had so many of them now who have [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1055.86s)]
*  done this. They all, by the way, they're all smearing me simply because I disagree with them [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1061.06s)]
*  on foreign policy. That is the bottom. If I didn't, let's get real here. Mark Levin, Mr. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1066.42s)]
*  constitutional conservative. If I saw eye to eye with you on war, you'd have nothing but great [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1072.74s)]
*  things to say about me. That's the truth was, you know, it's, it's the whatever it's this like dumb, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1078.1s)]
*  most pathetic game. And it's, it is like, there's something that's there's like an irony or something [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1084.4199999999998s)]
*  where I'm the comedian podcaster, right? So like you're essentially the whole point. What is always [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1096.26s)]
*  the point is like, we're the professional people who talk about wars and cheerlead all of them. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1103.54s)]
*  You're just some comedian podcaster. The argument being like that we're the serious professional [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1109.7s)]
*  people. You're like the, the class clown type character. And yet every single time I'm attempting [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1114.8999999999999s)]
*  to present arguments backed up by historical facts with sources and they are playing mean girl games. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1123.86s)]
*  Like it's fucking, it's the gayest shit I've ever seen in my life. Like they argue like 16 year old [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1132.98s)]
*  girls. I just couldn't imagine ever showing up to any type of political debate or take down or [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1139.3000000000002s)]
*  whatever you want to call this. And starting with no one even knows yet. We don't even know your name. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1146.74s)]
*  I don't even know your name. What is it? Some comedian guy. I mean, who even needs a sidekick? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1152.8200000000002s)]
*  Why can't you just do it yourself? It's like sidekick. It's it was an interview. Interview? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1158.4199999999998s)]
*  Is this like some, this is some novel like idea? I don't know. Anyway, rather what I'm sorry if [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1165.3s)]
*  there's not much substance here, but what can I, what did he give me to contend with? But isn't [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1172.98s)]
*  it just something? It's just interesting how it always goes the same way. And if you got three [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1177.9399999999998s)]
*  hours to fill with no sidekick, you can always replace it with long pauses. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1182.98s)]
*  Also, you don't, by the way, you don't have three hours to fill. That's the other comment I was [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1188.9s)]
*  making at the beginning of that. You don't have three hours to fill. You have commercials, then [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1193.54s)]
*  it comes in. You have that, that, you know, sound graphic thing. And you say that. It's literally [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1197.38s)]
*  30 minutes of Mark Levin up front if even. And by the way, I forgot about Karl Mark Levin. I only [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1204.34s)]
*  like Yelly Mark Levin when he's here. This is the calm Mark Levin. That's not my impression. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1209.94s)]
*  It always that's right. It always it's one or the other. He goes two speeds, you know, slow you down [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1215.7800000000002s)]
*  or jerk fast. But he's a yeah. It's like you don't talk for three hours. You probably spend [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1221.22s)]
*  20 minutes saying the phone number. You know, they do that constantly in radio. They have to keep [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1230.2600000000002s)]
*  telling you the number over and over and over again. So anyway, whatever. And as you've already [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1236.34s)]
*  demonstrated, you fill a lot of it with fluff and zero substance. But OK, let's keep playing. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1241.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, his platform. Is it subscription rich? I don't know. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1249.3799999999999s)]
*  It is. So he needs to have hits. He needs subscribers. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1253.54s)]
*  That's all well and good. I believe in capitalism, too. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1258.98s)]
*  But that said, reading is fundamental. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1261.78s)]
*  We have this site media, which is really a low life bunch of morons [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1266.4199999999998s)]
*  and quote me on that. Will you for once media low life bunch of morons, pre-vibescent low IQ [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1272.5s)]
*  individuals who actually don't produce any substance, but take the words of other people, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1280.02s)]
*  slap headlines on them and in many cases twist them out of context. So the other day they said [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1286.4199999999998s)]
*  I called the envoy. But let's pause it right here because he's about to get into it. Obviously me [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1291.62s)]
*  and me and Tucker talked about his comments about Wittkopf on the show. But I will say this. I just [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1297.62s)]
*  I found this to be hilarious. What he's saying about media and I don't I'm not like a very [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1304.26s)]
*  regular, you know, a few times I've clicked on their videos and, you know, like they're one of [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1310.1000000000001s)]
*  the sites that's out there. He's right that they're an aggregate. Like they just take content from [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1320.1000000000001s)]
*  other things and then run like it's not really a story. They're just kind of like story. Tucker [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1324.66s)]
*  Carlson said this on his podcast and you're like, you could just go to the podcast. Like you don't [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1331.78s)]
*  really need that. But that's their their business model. Without any comment on that business model. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1336.74s)]
*  I just found it hilarious that Medi-ite ran this. Like I thought that was the ultimate response. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1342.98s)]
*  Media just did it again with this content. It's like no matter how much you try to fight them. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1349.94s)]
*  They're like, great article right there. So just post this video. This is why I saw it. It was from [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1355.38s)]
*  Medi-ite or you sent it to me Rob actually at first. But it was a Medi-ite link. Anyway, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1360.66s)]
*  I just thought that was kind of funny. Okay, let's get into the substance here. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1367.6200000000001s)]
*  Twist them out of context. So the other day they said I called the envoy a traitor in the title. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1372.26s)]
*  And then in a body the piece they said he called them the essentially he essentially called him a [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1380.02s)]
*  traitor. I never called him a traitor. I know how to say traitor. I know how to write traitor. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1385.22s)]
*  So in comes Chatworth Osborne Jr. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1393.3s)]
*  And hold on. I got to find exactly what I wrote here. I should ask him because he wrote it down. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1399.38s)]
*  He thought it was so important. Oh, speaking of the envoy who talked about the neocon element. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1403.54s)]
*  And I'm guessing he used that phrase because he has no idea what it means. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1413.06s)]
*  You see all the neoconcertives are dead. They were old time Democrats who banded the Democrat Party [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1416.4199999999998s)]
*  and were hawks when it came to foreign policy. And many of them were quite brilliant. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1427.7s)]
*  And as I said, Chatworth Osborne Jr. was of that ilk or part of that ilk [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1434.98s)]
*  as a senior writer, maybe even an editor at the non-existent Crystal magazine. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1450.1000000000001s)]
*  Fox News Mark Levin ripped Witkoff, you see, called him a traitor. I never called him a traitor. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1460.18s)]
*  In fact, I never would call him a traitor. But he posts this and then I posted this. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1466.6599999999999s)]
*  By the way, neocon is a pejorative for Jew. Unbelievable. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1472.8999999999999s)]
*  You see all the neocons are gone. So why do they keep using the word neoconservative? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1479.94s)]
*  Why do they keep using the word neoconservative? Note that they don't use hawk, interventionist, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1485.7s)]
*  neocon. Why do they keep saying neocon? Because many of the neoconservatives were old time [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1491.7s)]
*  left wing Democrat Jews. Can we just pause here for a second? Sure. Chatworth knows it. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1499.14s)]
*  You see, this to me is, I, all right, I'm going to be the gay Jew on this one. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1506.98s)]
*  And this to me is dangerous for Jews. Because when you say a neocon, you're criticizing the idea [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1513.1399999999999s)]
*  of pro-war individuals. And now you could probably get into the history better than I can of who were [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1521.3s)]
*  the neocons and the damage that they've done to this country. I'm not as intelligent. I don't [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1526.6599999999999s)]
*  know the history. You say the word neocon and I'm thinking of the largely conservative individuals [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1531.06s)]
*  who are always looking for and preaching for war. There is no affiliation to Jewish people. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1536.74s)]
*  When I hear that word, that's not what people are criticizing. If they wanted to criticize, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1541.94s)]
*  hey, there's an issue with Jewish people, then they're jumping into anti-Semitism. And now [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1546.66s)]
*  you're saying Jews. And that's not even necessarily an affiliation with war. You could say all of these [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1550.98s)]
*  Jews who are pitching war. When you say the word neocon, you're conveying one thing, which is I [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1555.78s)]
*  am actually just calling them the title of the group of people that are very pro-war and advocate [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1561.54s)]
*  for war. And that almost became an insult to people of, oh, you're just a neocon because they [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1566.5s)]
*  were so wrong and they led us to so many disastrous wars that it almost becomes embarrassing to have [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1571.78s)]
*  the title neocon because now you're easily dismissed and being within this category that was so [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1576.82s)]
*  drastically wrong on so many things and just likes war. But when you say the word neocon, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1582.9s)]
*  it has zero affiliation with Jewish people until someone like Mark Levin steps in and goes, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1588.66s)]
*  oh, the Jews are so highly affiliated with being pro-war in this country. Then when you say neocon, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1594.66s)]
*  you're actually trying, no one had this affiliation until I'm hearing it introduced here. And now [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1600.8200000000002s)]
*  you're actually actively affiliating Jewish ideas and Jewish people with the horrible war machine of [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1607.14s)]
*  our country that people are actually trying to criticize. Right. Well, okay. So I think that's [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1614.18s)]
*  exactly right. He's also just wrong when he says all the neocons are dead. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1620.42s)]
*  It's the anti-Semitism thing. He's trying to hide behind not having an argument for his ideas [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1626.5s)]
*  and instead dismissing people that want to criticize the actual ideas of being pro-war [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1633.94s)]
*  as, oh, you're just being anti-Semitic or you're just being anti-Jew, which then allows him to not [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1638.3400000000001s)]
*  actually have an argument over the issues that he's probably wrong about but would like to preach to [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1643.3000000000002s)]
*  you. Right. Exactly. So just to be clear here, because this is something that's quite funny [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1648.42s)]
*  about it. This was in my debate with Douglas Murray, as many of you saw, at one point I said [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1656.5s)]
*  something about neoconservatives and he said, ah, the N-word. And then he wrote a book called [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1665.14s)]
*  Neoconservatism, Why We Need It. So this is not, you know how there are like terms like, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1672.18s)]
*  I never liked this one. I never used it. But do you remember the branch covideans was a term [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1678.26s)]
*  that people used? It was a term for the COVID insane lockdown. The reason I didn't like the term [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1683.8600000000001s)]
*  because like the branch Davidians weren't the bad guys in that story. I didn't like, you know what [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1688.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm saying? Like the bad guys were the ATF and the FBI, not the Davidians anyway. But you'd kind of [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1694.3400000000001s)]
*  come up with a term for like, say, the people who wanted to lock down the country. And then you use [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1701.62s)]
*  that as a pejorative because they were wrong about everything. And it had a disastrous consequence [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1707.78s)]
*  when their policy was implemented. This is something different. This is their term. This is what [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1712.6599999999999s)]
*  they called themselves. They self identified as neoconservatives. Okay. And they wrote, they wrote [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1718.4199999999998s)]
*  books and books and books and articles, and they had think tanks. And this is what they called [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1726.82s)]
*  themselves. Now, when he says the old neocons, the neocons are all dead. No, the first generation of [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1733.06s)]
*  them are dead. Those guys really did not get much political power. Almost all of the neoconservatives [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1740.02s)]
*  are still alive. Now, it is true that like, for example, like Irving Kristol is dead, but Bill [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1746.74s)]
*  Kristol is still alive. Norman Potthart is dead, but John Potthart is still alive. And calling Thomas [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1754.82s)]
*  Massey anti-Semitic filth for saying we're $36 trillion in debt, we can't afford to fund Israel's [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1761.46s)]
*  war. So there's still, but look, it is true that somewhere along the line, neoconservative just [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1768.1s)]
*  kind of became a pejorative for Warhawks. It's kind of, maybe there's a comparison there, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1777.62s)]
*  but it's kind of like the word woke. Now woke and the term social justice warrior, these were [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1785.86s)]
*  self descriptors at first, like the people who were woke called themselves woke. Then [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1793.4599999999998s)]
*  it became a pejorative. These days, if you hear the term woke used, you're almost always hearing [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1801.54s)]
*  it as an insult towards somebody. But okay, you don't get to just say the word is offensive [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1807.3s)]
*  when you embraced the word. Like, I'm sorry, this is too goofy. And so, okay, there were a lot of [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1814.18s)]
*  self described neoconservatives. They were not all Jewish, although disproportionately, there were a [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1821.3s)]
*  lot of Jews involved. But there were people like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, and there were [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1828.9s)]
*  always people in the group who were not Jewish, but they agreed with their views on foreign policy, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1836.1000000000001s)]
*  which as Mark Levin said, were extremely hawkish. Now, what happened is that the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1842.02s)]
*  neoconservatives, the self described neoconservatives, they hijacked US foreign [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1847.06s)]
*  policy in the George W. Bush administration. So they were really the ones calling the shots [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1853.78s)]
*  right after 9 11. And it's the greatest tragedy of the 21st century that they were in positions of [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1859.54s)]
*  power at this time. And they're the ones who launched the war on terrorism. And this now they [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1864.74s)]
*  it is true that of the self described neoconservatives, the a lot of them are no longer in [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1873.62s)]
*  power now meant some of them are not that far from being out of power. Of course, the architect [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1881.14s)]
*  of the entire catastrophe in Ukraine was Victoria Newland, who was hired by Dick Cheney, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1886.9s)]
*  and then promoted by Hillary Clinton. And she this is the wife of Robert Kagan, who was a [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1894.66s)]
*  project for a new American century self described neoconservative. So no, it's not like, Oh, this is [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1902.8200000000002s)]
*  ancient history. None of them have been around. They're all dead. That's just a lie. But it is [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1910.26s)]
*  true that essentially, while while Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and a lot the guys from the [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1914.42s)]
*  project for a new American century, with the exception of Robert Kagan's wife, who was just [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1920.1s)]
*  in power until Donald Trump came back in. It's true, most of them aren't in power anymore. But [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1924.26s)]
*  the policy continued nonetheless. And somewhere along the line, neocon became a pejorative for [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1931.86s)]
*  the guys trying to get us into the next stupid war. But this term was applied. And look, you could [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1939.7s)]
*  argue like this term was applied to people who don't self describe as neocons. But it was applied [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1945.14s)]
*  to people like john mccain, or Lindsey Graham, who were not self identified neocons, but had foreign [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1950.98s)]
*  policy that was indistinguishable from the neoconservatives. By the way, both john mccain and [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1958.26s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, not Jewish. But people still throw the term out at them because they're stupid war [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1963.54s)]
*  hawks. There's like, it's just it's ridiculous to say that this term is off limits, because now, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1970.42s)]
*  which is what essentially all of them are doing, right? Is that they all they like the neocon [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1978.26s)]
*  agenda, but they know that the term neocon is kind of associated with catastrophe. And so they're [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1983.7s)]
*  like, Hey, stop using that word that we used to use it like people like Mark Levin, right? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1992.26s)]
*  Defended the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. And I'm sure it was critical. I mean, I don't [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=1999.14s)]
*  know enough about him, but I'm sure it was critical of Obama for not being harsher, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2004.26s)]
*  or for not being more of a hawk. And you know, it's like, okay, but like, no, I'm sorry, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2007.86s)]
*  because essentially what they're saying here on top of like, your point is completely right, Rob, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2013.3s)]
*  but on top of just this thing where you're making it a Jewish thing when it's not, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2017.3s)]
*  or not entirely, at least, it's also a desperate attempt to get away from your own track record. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2021.62s)]
*  You know, to be like, no, no, no, we don't talk about that anymore. You're not allowed to have [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2029.78s)]
*  a word that you use to dismiss all of us based off of our history of disaster. All right, guys, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2033.94s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is monetary metals. I've [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2041.86s)]
*  been telling you about this company for a while. They're a great company run by great people, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2045.7s)]
*  and they are revolutionizing the precious metal space. As many of you know, gold has hit historic [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2049.78s)]
*  highs over the last year, and many people are excited about that. Of course, people own [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2056.5800000000004s)]
*  precious metals for different reasons. One of the major reasons is as a hedge against inflation. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2060.5800000000004s)]
*  But a lot of people are doing it all wrong. You're either holding your gold at home, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2066.34s)]
*  and it's collecting dust, or you're paying storage fees to have it professionally stored for you. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2071.1400000000003s)]
*  Now, because of monetary metals, there's a different superior option, which is you can [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2076.5s)]
*  put your precious metals to work for you. So not only are you owning gold or silver, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2081.38s)]
*  but you're owning gold and silver that generates interest paid in additional ounces. So your total [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2086.18s)]
*  amount of gold is growing or your total amount of silver is growing. If that sounds like something [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2092.02s)]
*  you're interested in, go check out monetary metals at monetary-metals.com. That's monetary-metals.com. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2096.26s)]
*  Let's get back into the show. The funny thing is that none of them even have a response to that. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2105.7799999999997s)]
*  They sit there and say what they will about, I'm just a comedian, or I don't know what I'm [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2115.54s)]
*  telling you. It's like, oh, okay. All that stuff. Fine. You could pretend to not know my name. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2119.22s)]
*  I don't really give a shit. As Mark Levin said at one point there, he goes, I like capitalism. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2123.46s)]
*  He kind of threw this weird little insult at Tucker. Oh, he has a subscription model. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2129.3s)]
*  I guess that means he needs subscribers. Yeah, and you have a radio show. You need listeners. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2133.14s)]
*  But what are you talking about? We're all in the same business. But if you are a capitalism guy, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2138.66s)]
*  that means that kind of the market gets to determine whose voice ought to be heard. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2145.54s)]

*  that they got to keep, but then they also got a job that they got to keep. So they're caught in [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2943.86s)]
*  this kind of weird spot. And at one point, Michael Knowles is saying, he's like, look, I've heard a [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2947.22s)]
*  lot of people make arguments, but no one's really made a convincing argument to me of why Israel [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2952.02s)]
*  doesn't have a right to go to war over October 7th. Now, leaving that aside, because I think a lot of [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2956.9s)]
*  people, including myself, made pretty damn convincing arguments about why Israel doesn't [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2963.2999999999997s)]
*  have a right to do what they're doing, but whatever. That's what he says. And then in a certain, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2966.74s)]
*  and then at a point in that it's almost like he just says it without really thinking of the [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2970.02s)]
*  implication. But he goes, he goes, look, I want the war to end tomorrow. Just like as an American, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2973.2999999999997s)]
*  I think it's better. And it's in our interest for the war to end. I mean, it's just causing all types [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2978.9799999999996s)]
*  of problems, you know, but still Israel has a right to do this. And then you like, you almost like, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2983.22s)]
*  you're like, Oh, wait, hold on. But so you just subtly admitted that even from your point of view, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2988.8199999999997s)]
*  it's in America's interest for the war to stop. So you're telling me we got to fund an arm, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=2994.74s)]
*  a war that is against our interests. Give me a break with this bullshit. Mark, you know why? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3000.66s)]
*  Listen, man, Mark Levin has a 40 year headstart on me in this game. Literally. I bet he's been [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3007.9399999999996s)]
*  doing it since I was two years old. Okay. And he has tens of millions of dollars and he works for [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3015.06s)]
*  billion dollar companies and has syndicated all across the country. And in the marketplace, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3021.22s)]
*  I have not only caught but beat him due to one simple fact. The American people are not where [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3026.98s)]
*  you are. They're just not. It's born out in every single opinion poll that you can find. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3033.8599999999997s)]
*  The American people do not recognize that the Islamo Nazis are our biggest concern. The American [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3039.54s)]
*  people recognize that like, you know, people pouring into the country by the millions illegally, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3045.9399999999996s)]
*  that's our big concern. That are losing the purchasing power of our dollar. That's our big [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3050.26s)]
*  concern. Why are we losing all this purchasing power in our dollar? Well, a big part of it is [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3054.82s)]
*  we've spent $10 trillion on maintaining an empire over the last 25 years. Had to print a lot of money [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3059.46s)]
*  to make up for that. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3065.78s)]
*  which is Moinc, a great company. They've been a longtime sponsor of this podcast. And I think in [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3070.82s)]
*  a lot of ways, the country has kind of caught up to where Moinc's been for a long time. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3076.66s)]
*  I don't know about you guys. I do not trust the meat that is at the supermarket. Even the ones [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3083.62s)]
*  that say, you know, they're organic or say they're this or that. You just never really know where [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3090.02s)]
*  that stuff's coming from. But now you don't have to worry about any of that because you can just [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3094.98s)]
*  go right to Moinc and then you get your meat directly from family farms. Their business is [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3098.8999999999996s)]
*  simple. Moinc meat comes from animals raised outdoors where a pig is free to be a pig. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3104.26s)]
*  Their farmers are given an honest day's pay for an honest day's work and they deliver meat straight [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3109.86s)]
*  to your doorstep at prices you can actually afford. I've been getting this stuff for a while. The [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3114.7400000000002s)]
*  meat is absolutely delicious and it's very convenient that they deliver it right to you. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3119.38s)]
*  Support American family farms and join the Moinc movement today at moincbox.com slash p-o-t-p right [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3123.78s)]

*  only for a limited time. They've had a lot of giveaways. This is the best one that they've [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3138.2599999999998s)]

*  into the show. So no Mark Levin, the people are not with you. And I'll say on top of that, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3157.86s)]
*  the people by and large don't hate Jews. They just hate forever wars. I'll give you that final [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3163.94s)]
*  thoughts on this, Rob. And then I know you do. You got to run out for a call, but I encourage you to [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3170.98s)]
*  keep on going because I feel like Mark Levin, it deserves more trashing here and you're doing [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3174.7400000000002s)]
*  an excellent job. All right. Thank you, sir. We will talk to you guys. Make sure you go check out, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3179.6200000000003s)]
*  run your mouth, go to the porch tour.com. Okay. Let's keep playing. I'll do another [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3183.54s)]
*  few minutes on this without Rob. Let's keep playing. You're dead. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3189.38s)]
*  Now people use neocon. Many people innocently, they don't know what it means. He knows what it [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3197.86s)]
*  means. And my point to our envoy was, why are you using word like that? Because you don't even know [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3203.54s)]
*  what it means as do others. And so the point was to let them know that it's a pejorative, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3212.82s)]
*  what it's a pejorative war and it's unbelievable that he spews it and he'll keep spewing it in [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3222.26s)]
*  others well too. But I don't have to pretend I'm Helen Keller that I don't see and I don't hear [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3227.46s)]
*  and neither do you and neither do you. And there's a whole pattern over there [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3235.54s)]
*  with Chatsworth Osborne Jr. A whole pattern. Now he's free to do what he wants. I believe in free [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3241.14s)]
*  speech. Go ahead, buy a subscription, do whatever you want. It's perfectly fine by me, but don't [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3250.1s)]
*  screw with me a little bastard by twisting my words. All right. Let's pick up the phone. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3257.22s)]
*  Don't don't screw with Mark Levin or what or what you old soft man, what are you going to do? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3266.1s)]
*  Launch the dumbest rant I've ever heard. Listen, Steve Witkoff knows exactly what the term [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3274.74s)]
*  neoconservative means. And more important than that, he knows what it means in common parlance. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3280.42s)]
*  Like he knows what it means today. What he means is Warhawk. Yes, it's a pejorative for Warhawks [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3285.22s)]
*  because Witkoff is trying his best, it seems, to make peace around the world. And you know, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3291.86s)]
*  okay, it's not going perfectly, but actually he's had some very real, very tangible success, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3298.98s)]
*  saved some human beings lives. Again, as I know, this is a running theme on the show at this point, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3304.98s)]
*  but isn't it interesting how none of them seem to care about that? Isn't that so goddamn fascinating [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3310.7400000000002s)]
*  that me here as the self-hating Jew Hamas sympathizer or whatever the fuck I get called [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3315.94s)]
*  on Twitter, I'm the one who's celebrating that 20 hostages got returned over the last few months. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3321.46s)]
*  21, when you count the American. But so yes, he knows again, you know, woke it like the term woke [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3327.78s)]
*  is what I made the enough, you know, it first started as like a black consciousness term. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3336.34s)]
*  It started as like black people. The idea was to get woke to wake up to like this is the systemic [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3342.98s)]
*  oppression and the kind of false narratives that have been created. And then, as is typically the [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3349.54s)]
*  case, it started in the black community. And then a bunch of white liberals were like, Oh, that's [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3355.46s)]
*  cool. We want it. And so they took it. And then they did really, really stupid things with it, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3360.58s)]
*  like argue that, you know, gender is made up and all types of ridiculous stuff. And now it's [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3365.94s)]
*  pejorative used to smear that. But if anyone were to say to you, they go, you don't even know what [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3373.14s)]
*  the term means. The term means black consciousness. It's like, eh, it once did. It doesn't anymore. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3380.26s)]
*  That's the way words work. You know, language evolves like that. And yes, the term neocon is [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3385.94s)]
*  now just a pejorative for war hawk because you guys have lost the fucking argument. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3391.7s)]
*  That's the truth. You know, there's a real, there's a real irony in the, in the whole, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3398.8999999999996s)]
*  you know, last month, the whole nonsense about like experts and, you know, you've never been [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3405.7799999999997s)]
*  and all, all that ridiculous stuff. It's like, look, I will be the first to admit it. It's true. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3414.02s)]
*  It is ridiculous. It is. It is ridiculous. There should be better people. There should be better [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3421.94s)]
*  people. It's just that you guys suck so much that I can fuck all of you up. It is why I wreck these [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3426.9s)]
*  guys every time they're willing to debate to the point that I don't think too many of them are [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3436.7400000000002s)]
*  going to be willing to debate anymore. There's someone was trying to set, oh, it was Josie, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3441.22s)]
*  the redheaded libertarian on Twitter. She was trying to set up a debate on the woke, right? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3445.9399999999996s)]
*  And between me and James limbs, James Lindsay, and I was like, yeah, absolutely. I'll do it. And he [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3451.14s)]
*  was like, no, we're not doing that. And of course not. Why would they is none of you guys have lost [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3455.7s)]
*  the fucking argument because your argument is built off lies and blood. That's it. No one's going [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3461.7s)]
*  to stop using neocon as a pejorative because Mark Levin threatened them. Keep ranting. Keep, keep, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3469.94s)]
*  keep your dumb rants coming. Please. It's just more content. Please keep them coming. Sorry. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3476.5800000000004s)]
*  You guys it's in, listen, I've say what you will about me. There's far more educated people than [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3482.5800000000004s)]
*  me. I've read like everything the neocons have ever fucking written. I know all the shit they [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3487.78s)]
*  wrote in the project for a new American century. I know their whole clean break strategy and their [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3492.26s)]
*  whole seven countries in five years strategy read everything they've written. And you don't get to [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3496.58s)]
*  walk away from that now, especially people like Mark Levin who fucking supported it from a, from [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3502.66s)]
*  a position of power, you know, there's somebody having a real influence. One of the biggest [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3506.9s)]
*  right-wing talk radio show hosts in the country. You supported every one of these catastrophic [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3511.86s)]
*  wars. And now that they've all ended in disaster, you got to deal with being called the neocon for [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3515.94s)]
*  it. So fuck neocons and we're never going to stop saying that word. Okay. That's the show for today. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3521.46s)]
*  Thank you guys so much for listening. I do appreciate it. I'll see some of you guys out [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQnKhMQTXo&t=3527.38s)]
