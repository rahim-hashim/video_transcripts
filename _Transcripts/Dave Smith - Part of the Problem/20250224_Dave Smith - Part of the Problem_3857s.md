**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8)
*  What's up. What's up everybody. Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=0.0s)]
*  It's good to be back home. We are live back from Houston. Thank you to everybody who came [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=11.84s)]
*  out. We had a great time out there. And of course I'm joined by Robbie the fire Bernstein [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=17.12s)]
*  as I was in Houston. How are you, sir? I'm doing well. How are you, Mr. Smith? Very, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=21.32s)]
*  good. I cannot complain. I'm a little, well, you know, I can now that I thought about it [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=27.0s)]
*  that let I can complain a little bit. Now I'm just, uh, you know, Monday's after a long [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  weekend for whatever reason, it's always like, you know, I have a long weekend and a lot of travel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  And then Monday I have to go in to the city for Legion of skanks. I have art podcasts and it's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=44.36s)]
*  always like clockwork that Monday coming off of a weekend of travel is always when [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=50.04s)]
*  Pierce Morgan calls or whoever wants to add a show and always for whatever reason that Sunday [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=56.52s)]
*  night my kids won't sleep. So I'm just up all night and then for after, after being up all night, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  cause you know the way so like we'll be, I got back to the hotel at like one in the morning on [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=69.4s)]
*  Saturday night and then I had to leave for the airport at three in the morning. So there's no [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=73.72s)]
*  sleep that night. And then I come back and I got a pack day on Monday and I'm like, all I need is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=78.28s)]
*  a good night's sleep on Sunday. And my three year old just somewhere in his soul, he hears that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=83.16s)]
*  and he was like, all right, let's wake up 15 times tonight. How about that? Anyway, I eat, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=89.4s)]
*  that's it. I can't complain. Pee can pie from the supermarket and went to sleep around 9 PM. It was [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=95.48s)]
*  great. Well, there you go. I mean, that's listen, there's a, there's benefits to the single life. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=99.64s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. There's one of them. I do not have the opportunity to do that. Anyway, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=105.96s)]
*  though, it was a lot of fun and I, we had a particularly great time. A lot of our people [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=111.24s)]
*  were out there in Houston. So it was great to see Tom woods and all those guys. So that was, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  that was a lot of fun. And then our next stop is in Buffalo, New York. And it looks like I got a, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I have the go ahead to promote it yet, but it looks like there's, we're going to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=128.6s)]
*  attach a Canada show to that as well. But comic Dave Smith.com for the ticket links there will be [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=132.28s)]
*  up at a helium Buffalo and then doing a show in Canada. It looks like after that. So please come [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=138.44s)]
*  out and see us there. Comic Dave Smith.com. Okay. So there's a few things that I was thinking about [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=143.8s)]
*  talking about on today's show. I guess we could just, we could start with the fact that since the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=153.64s)]
*  last, since our last episode, um, cash Patel has been confirmed as the FBI director. Uh, Dan [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=161.32s)]
*  Bongino has been added as the deputy director, which was a, that I had not heard floated out [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=171.0s)]
*  before. So kind of interesting. Um, and so, yeah, this is a, a big development at this point. I [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  think it's kind of safe to say that, uh, basically Donald Trump got all of his controversial [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=186.84s)]
*  appointments through minus Matt Gates. And by the way, when I say controversial appointments, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=194.04s)]
*  I don't mean that at all as a slight, these were the only guys that I liked were the ones who were [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=198.6s)]
*  controversial. Um, but I, but so he did get cash Patel and he's got Bongino there at the FBI now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=202.84s)]
*  I don't know. I'm kind of curious what your thoughts on this are, Rob. Uh, certainly at least [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=210.28s)]
*  it seems that Donald Trump 2.0 compared to the first, uh, four years of Donald Trump's term has [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=217.0s)]
*  certainly done a better job protecting himself. If nothing else, that he's got some guys who do seem [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=227.16s)]
*  to be loyalists who were outside of the cabal of people who were weaponizing the government against [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=234.2s)]
*  him. You know, keep in mind how integral the FBI was to shutting down Donald Trump's agenda in his [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=240.68s)]
*  first four years. So it's a whole different situation at least currently. What do you, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=247.16s)]
*  what do you think about cash getting in there, Bongino or any of this stuff? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  Firstly, Bongino getting in there is a big win for bald, loud mouths. Uh, so [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=257.24s)]
*  in terms of, you know, just looking at the economic landscape and seeing what your career [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=264.44s)]
*  trajectory could be the fact that a podcaster who talks a lot of shit just got a job in the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=268.44s)]
*  political administration and a real job at that is pretty cool. I never thought about it like that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=275.48s)]
*  That's a good point. All right. You have finally, it's like people, when Kamala Harris is running, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=279.8s)]
*  they're like, think of the little girls who will think they can be president. But this is, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=283.8s)]
*  you're saying for you, this is like shattering a glass ceiling. Exactly. I mean, just a couple [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=287.0s)]
*  years ago, they were keeping us out of all jobs and industries and, uh, you know, it's nice to see [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=291.32s)]
*  a turnaround as we get rid of the DEI. So that, that makes me feel good. Uh, I'm not too familiar [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=295.32s)]
*  with his work, but I know he talked a lot of shit about, uh, when they tried to kill Donald Trump. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=301.24s)]
*  And I think he, uh, really dove into the, uh, Russia collusion story. And so I think Trump's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=305.64s)]
*  doing, like you said, a much better job of making sure that he has loyalists around him. Uh, and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=311.32s)]
*  I mean, we're seeing him actually push forward with his agenda this time around in a way he never was [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=316.36s)]
*  able to when they concocted that bullshit Russia story the last time. So it's, uh, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=321.0s)]
*  and it's also fun to have all these just good looking television personalities surrounding him. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=326.6s)]
*  I do like the just TV element to what Donald Trump does. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=331.4s)]
*  He's always had that. He's always had this obsession with like central casting and like, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=335.0s)]
*  you know, the people having the right look. What was his first press secretary? Sean Spicer? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=340.2s)]
*  Was that his first, uh, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=345.16s)]
*  he got canned immediately for some hot blondes. Yeah. At first it was the heavy set, uh, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=346.68s)]
*  Huckabee. And then he gave us, right. And then he went to the blondes, but it was, but literally [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=352.36s)]
*  him and Sean Spicer, like, like this was their big thing that he'd be like, you don't look good [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=357.64s)]
*  in that suit. You got to wear this suit. You don't look good on TV and this, but you know, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=362.12s)]
*  it's he's got an interesting mind that Donald Trump, I do think you make a very good point. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=366.36s)]
*  There's something to me that I mean, particularly like in a self-serving kind of way, maybe that I [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=371.8s)]
*  find it a little bit fascinating because like we're in whatever this world of shows on the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=378.44000000000005s)]
*  internet talking about politics, whatever that world is, and that there's been so many people [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  who are like fixtures in that world now coming into these positions. Now don't get me wrong. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  Um, you know, like Pete Hagstead, for example, wasn't just a Fox news show host. He had other [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  things on his resume and, and Dan Bongino was in the secret service before he was a Fox news host [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=401.4s)]
*  and then a TV and then an internet personality or whatever. And Cash Patel was a regular guest on [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=406.52s)]
*  a lot of podcasts and stuff. So it's just, I guess one of the things that I'm thinking about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=412.52s)]
*  is like, we've got these guys, particularly with say Bongino and, and Cash Patel who have like, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=418.67999999999995s)]
*  as you started alluding to then you're absolutely right about Bongino. In fact, I I've never been, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=428.12s)]
*  um, like I know who Dan Bongino is. I don't think I've ever met him, but I know, I know him and I [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=433.4s)]
*  knew who he was when he was up Fox news and stuff. Um, but I've, I never like watch his podcast [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=438.12s)]
*  except for after the, uh, the assassination attempt, because I did just find it interesting [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=443.4s)]
*  because he was a secret service agent for many years. So it was kind of interesting to have [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=449.23999999999995s)]
*  his perspective on it. And he was, look, he w I'm not trying to overplay what he said. Like he [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=453.24s)]
*  wasn't like, this is a conspiracy. And they did that, but he was pretty leaning on that side of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=460.52s)]
*  like, there's, there's something missing of this story here. There's no way they failed this [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=466.52s)]
*  blatantly. And like something's going on here. Um, both of them wildly outspoken about Russia [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=470.92s)]
*  and how, I mean, they would literally at least what they've been saying over the last years, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=478.52s)]
*  they'd be right where me and you are, not just saying that the story was wrong, but saying that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=483.64s)]
*  this was an intentional attempted coup by the deep state using known lies to try to frame the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=489.08s)]
*  president of the United States for treason. And I gotta say, from my perspective, you know, I had [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=498.2s)]
*  a rant about this a few episodes ago that ended up going viral. And, you know, I appreciate everybody [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=505.72s)]
*  who shares the content. I will say in some way, I think putting these guys in there, at least in my [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=511.48s)]
*  mind, it almost kind of sets a higher bar now. And I don't think, you know, like, I think this [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=521.08s)]
*  is fairly reasonable of me. I am, I'm somebody who was a fierce critic of Donald Trump through [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=527.88s)]
*  his first four years and then through the four years of Joe Biden's administration, while people [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=534.68s)]
*  were defending what he did. And I could, you know, I've gotten into that many times over the years. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  We could get into that if people want to. I was willing to come on board and throw my support [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  behind him in this last election, because, you know, I adjusted to the facts on the ground. And [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=550.92s)]
*  it seemed to be like a lot of things had changed. Kamala Harris was a uniquely horrible and terrifying [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=555.4799999999999s)]
*  candidate. And Donald Trump was all of a sudden in a unique position where it looked like, oh, he [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=561.72s)]
*  might actually mean it this time. And he might actually be trying to do some positive things. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=565.72s)]
*  And I will say so far, I feel pretty justified in that decision, even though there are some things [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=569.88s)]
*  I don't like in the new administration. But there are massive positives. And this is like a first [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  for me that I've ever felt this way about the sitting president of the United States. And so, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=582.6s)]
*  okay, I'm willing to like, kind of get on board and I'm willing to even accept that, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=587.72s)]
*  okay, some stuff I don't like is going to happen, but maybe we'll get some positives out of this. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=592.52s)]
*  But once you're giving the FBI to Cash Patel and Dan Bongino, it just seems like it's kind of a [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=597.88s)]
*  reasonable expectation now that you're going to prosecute some of these criminals. I mean, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=605.72s)]
*  you guys have the FBI now, you've talked about the crimes that have been committed, and these are not [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=610.2s)]
*  minor infractions. This is not Donald Trump paid off a hooker, but he had his lawyer do it. And I [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=614.6s)]
*  guess if we use this novel concept, we could say it was a campaign event, and then it wasn't [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=622.2s)]
*  disclosed on his business record. Like, I'm not talking bullshit like that. I'm talking like, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=627.4s)]
*  oh, the CIA and the FBI framed the sitting president of the United States for treason, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=631.64s)]
*  and then interfered in the 2020 election. It's like, okay, well, you're in charge of the FBI now. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=636.76s)]
*  How is it not? This isn't even like, it seems like this is the moderate position to take, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=642.1999999999999s)]
*  you know what I mean? Like, I'm taking the very reasonable position of like, okay, you said it, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=646.84s)]
*  you have the FBI now, you got Tulsi over there as the director of national intelligence, if you need [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=651.88s)]
*  any more of the information. You know what you guys are in charge of? You know, I mean, people [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=656.6s)]
*  might forget it. But the FBI is technically supposed to be in charge of investigating crimes. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=662.84s)]
*  So is it too crazy for me to expect that to happen? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=668.76s)]
*  I think you're right. And it's probably owed to the American people in some capacity with these [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=674.28s)]
*  picks. However, you know, there's that old saying the best revenge is a life well lived. And I think [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=680.04s)]
*  if the FBI were to turn its focus into actually prosecuting all the pedophiles that exist in this [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=685.8s)]
*  country, maybe cleaning up the fentanyl, and then just reporting, you know, there was a, I forgot [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=690.76s)]
*  what the number was, but there was a massive amount of the FBI that was allocated just to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=696.28s)]
*  prosecuting and rounding up the January six people. And now four years later, let's just say [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=700.4399999999999s)]
*  you put 100,000 pedophiles in jail, and you're able to go look at what the Biden administration [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=706.12s)]
*  left on the streets. And so I think if they while prosecuting, there's a lot of mess to be cleaned [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=710.92s)]
*  up. And if I had to pick what should be prosecuted, it would be the COVID-19 scandal, and going after [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=718.12s)]
*  Fauci and the relationship between big pharma and government. In terms of the FBI and CIA, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=724.28s)]
*  I think a lot of those people will probably get fired. And if you actually just start using those [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=730.04s)]
*  agencies for good, I think that becomes the, like just the biggest condemnation of the way that these [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=733.48s)]
*  agencies have been used in the past. Because look at the terrible crimes that went unpunished and [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=740.68s)]
*  unnoticed as you just use the resources to basically prosecute political prisoners. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=745.24s)]
*  Yes. Okay, look, there's a fair point there. But I think that point only works if you actually [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=750.4399999999999s)]
*  permanently get rid of all of these people. And there's almost like, because the baked in [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=757.72s)]
*  assumption there is that in four years, a Democrat doesn't come in and then just put all those same [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=763.96s)]
*  people back in the deep state apparatus. Because if that's the case, if that ends up happening, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=768.52s)]
*  then it's like, no, you blew it by not prosecuting when you actually had the opportunity to. So I get [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=774.2s)]
*  your point. Like there is something to that. Look, I am, I gotta say, I'm somewhat, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=779.24s)]
*  I'm a little bit torn sometimes on some of these issues. I'll tell you this one, by the, it's pretty [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=787.88s)]
*  rare that there's an issue of the day that comes up. And I'm like, I do not actually know how I feel [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=792.52s)]
*  about this. Like, I really got to think about this. I mean, I just like you typically at this point, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=797.8s)]
*  I have an opinion on what's going on, but I was reading about this apparent friction between [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=802.76s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard and Elon Musk that that's been going on. And so if people aren't familiar, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=809.9599999999999s)]
*  evidently Doge sent emails out to like everybody in the intelligence community, asking them to [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=816.3599999999999s)]
*  report on what they've been doing. And Tulsi has instructed everybody not to respond to this Doge [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  email. And so I'm sitting here, I'm reading about this and I'm like, okay, on the one hand, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=831.0s)]
*  I love what Doge is doing. I love the idea of government secrecy being exposed. And man, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=836.28s)]
*  I going after the intelligence community. You're like, yeah, that's like, that's the mother load [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=843.32s)]
*  of the evil secrets. On the other hand, I can totally understand where Tulsi Gabbard is coming [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=849.4s)]
*  from. But she's just like, Whoa, hold on, wait a minute, I just got this job. And now you are in [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=857.08s)]
*  effect, asking all of my underlings to give out classified information to people who do not have [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=862.84s)]
*  the security clearance. And you would think like, she might be in a situation like, like, I'm open [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=870.76s)]
*  enough to the possibility that you would go like, okay, look, like, even though all of this evil [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=876.44s)]
*  stuff has probably gone on, and there's a whole bunch of secret stuff that never needed to be [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=882.6s)]
*  classified to begin with it, you might need somebody there to decide what we're going to [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=886.2s)]
*  declassify and in what order and who's you know what I mean? Like, there's just, I could understand [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=891.8000000000001s)]
*  where Tulsi Gabbard is going to have to be like, Oh, no, but then you're totally like, just like, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=898.36s)]
*  usurping my authority to actually look at this as a patriotic veteran and go like, okay, what is in [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=903.32s)]
*  the national interest? Let's expose this, maybe this, you know, like needs to wait, or something [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=909.1600000000001s)]
*  like that. So I don't know, I'm curious if you have a strong opinion on that, but I'm actually [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=914.92s)]
*  genuinely torn on it. Off the bat, when I saw that he requested everyone in government has to send a [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=918.28s)]
*  short email with five things they did in the prior week, what they were working on. And if they don't, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=924.36s)]
*  it's considered as if they're handing in their resignation. And as much as I like what Doge is [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=929.24s)]
*  doing, that is some fuck you boss activity. Because firstly, you can fire me, or I can quit [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=934.1999999999999s)]
*  not doing something is not me resigning. So that's just like a nasty boss move of, no, you have to do [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=941.08s)]
*  this or you're resigning. Like, no, you can fire me for not doing the thing. It's not considered. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=949.08s)]
*  So I don't like that little game. And there's also just something about the pettiness of having to [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=954.36s)]
*  sit down and just do homework because the boss says, Hey, I need you to do this homework. So at first, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=958.92s)]
*  even as much as I don't like government employees, and a lot of them shouldn't have their jobs, I saw [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=964.52s)]
*  that from Elon Musk, I was like, fuck you, boss. I'm not writing this fucking email. Then Elon Musk [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=968.68s)]
*  claimed because that was the attitude of a lot of people of this is shitty boss behavior, that [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=974.4399999999999s)]
*  they're trying to clear. I don't know if this is true. He said they're trying to clean up for fraud. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=980.3599999999999s)]
*  And they think that there's a lot of dead email addresses that are collecting paychecks and that [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=983.88s)]
*  this was a simple way to at least figure out who's on payroll, and who might just be I don't know [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=988.12s)]
*  that that's true. And then you had cash. It's also unless that's what is coming from Donald Trump, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=995.16s)]
*  that seems crazy to automatically fire government employees if they're not doing a specific Elon [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1001.8s)]
*  Musk regarded homework assignment. That doesn't seem like the best way to be finding fraud and [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1007.0s)]
*  abuse that seems like boss behavior for Hey, I'm in charge here and you're going to be compliant [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1011.88s)]
*  towards me. So it's tough to get Elon Musk back on this particular way of finding the fraud and [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1016.28s)]
*  abuse. I'm all for finding the fraud and abuse. I'm all for firing, you know, shitty government [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1024.36s)]
*  workers. I can't imagine that this is the most sophisticated way to do it. Yeah, I mean, the thing [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1028.6799999999998s)]
*  is, what I try to remind myself all the time is that government employees aren't people. And so [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1034.6799999999998s)]
*  you can't feel emotion for them the way you would for normal people. I do get your point about the [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1040.6799999999998s)]
*  dickhead boss. I guess I just think even for me, when it started coming to like, classified [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1046.04s)]
*  information, but you know, at the CIA or the NSA or something like that, I guess that is where I [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1053.16s)]
*  was just like, this really kind of has to be done by putting a good director of national intelligence [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1059.72s)]
*  in there and having them make the decisions. And it seems like perhaps we just got that. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1066.2s)]
*  I could understand why Tulsi is going to resist this kind of I think that's a nonsense weasel out [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1071.88s)]
*  from her. I don't think Elon Musk is actually looking for progress reports as much as, hey, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1078.92s)]
*  here's your weekend homework assignment. And I think you could sit down and say, I was working on [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1084.92s)]
*  five classified debriefings. And that would be the end of the homework assignment. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1089.72s)]
*  Right, right, right. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Okay. So she could they could respond in [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1094.52s)]
*  a way that doesn't actually give up anything that's classified, which I guess, technically, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1098.8400000000001s)]
*  they can't legally they can't just give him classified information. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1102.04s)]
*  I think Cash and Tulsi were basically going, hey, we just got here. We're going to run our [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1105.64s)]
*  departments. So lay off. Yeah. Well, it does seem like look, and there is especially with [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1110.3600000000001s)]
*  with Cash and Tulsi. And this is why, by the way, I mean, if it wasn't them there, say Donald Trump, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1117.8000000000002s)]
*  I just picked terrible people for that position. I think there's no way I'd even I just be like, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1124.1200000000001s)]
*  yeah, I'm with Doge. Screw them. But it's just like, there is something where it's like, look, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1127.88s)]
*  we just put the heads of these departments as people who have been not just critics of the [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1133.0s)]
*  institutions, but have specifically called out these specific crimes that these organizations [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1140.92s)]
*  have committed. And so that is a little bit different than, you know, like, it's not me [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1146.28s)]
*  sitting here and saying, No, USAID, if we want to cut that, it should be done by Congress, and not [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1152.76s)]
*  by Doge. Because it's like, yeah, well, Congress is never going to do that. And this is we've tried [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1161.56s)]
*  this for decades and decades and decades. It just leads to this mess. So screw that Doge is the only [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1166.28s)]
*  tool we got. Let's use that. When I see Tulsi and Cash in there, I think this kind of relates to the [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1170.84s)]
*  opening point that I was making. Now, my expectation is like, we're going to get to the bottom of this, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1177.3999999999999s)]
*  right? I mean, even say, regardless of like, whether some of these criminals are prosecuted, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1181.96s)]
*  they're going to be fired, right? That's going to be revealed the crimes that were committed. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1186.76s)]
*  So if that's the plan, then I'm kind of like, well, actually, we don't need an act of Congress [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1191.48s)]
*  to do this, because we already put the people at the heads of these organizations. You know what [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1196.52s)]
*  I'm saying? Like, it's like, if we if we had just put Ron Paul in charge of USAID, and then Elon Musk [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1200.2s)]
*  was coming in going over his head, I'd be like, Hey, back off, let him cook. You know what I mean? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1207.0800000000002s)]
*  And so that I guess that's just a little bit how I feel in this area. But I don't I'm humble and [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1212.28s)]
*  open on this one where I'd go maybe someone can you know, maybe I could be persuaded either way. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1218.2s)]
*  I do like the back to work or get fired. That one seems fair. If you don't even want your job [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1223.72s)]
*  enough to figure out how to report in for it, you can't have this job anymore. And then you could [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1230.52s)]
*  have the boss that comes forward and goes, No, this guy's a high productivity worker. And he's [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1235.32s)]
*  autistic. He doesn't work well in the office. Yeah, sure. Who those people are. But that one [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1239.96s)]
*  that one feels like a very fair bitch out of no, we're coming back to actual in office work. And [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1245.32s)]
*  if you don't want this job enough to show up for it, you can't have it. But that's being fired. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1250.68s)]
*  That's once again, it doesn't have that thing of well, then you're resigning. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1255.72s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. And it also well, it also is the type of thing where like, if anyone [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1259.0s)]
*  in a private company did that, we would be like, Yeah, that's a totally reasonable ask. You have to [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1262.8400000000001s)]
*  come to work. If you want to have your job, you have to come to work before the pandemic. That was [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1267.48s)]
*  something we all just took as a given. That was the bad was what having a job entailed part of it [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1271.8s)]
*  was going to work. You know, so anyway, how many people went into chat GPT and said, give me five [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1277.64s)]
*  things a person with this government title might have worked on last week. I bet it's more than [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1283.24s)]
*  zero. I bet the answer is positive number. He might have set it up to trap you for that. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1290.92s)]
*  You know, speaking of Elon Musk, and I guess this is kind of I wanted to play this clip from [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1299.64s)]
*  breaking points and kind of respond a little bit to it. Because it's kind of it's a little [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1305.4s)]
*  bit on a similar topic, but it gets into kind of broader conversations about [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1311.16s)]
*  it. About theory and philosophy on what government is and different kind of political views. So [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1315.88s)]
*  and let me just just preface by saying because I am playing this clip, I really disagree with much [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1324.2s)]
*  of what crystal ball said here. I just do want to stay upfront that I like crystal ball very much. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1329.24s)]
*  And I'm a huge fan of breaking points. I think it's a an excellent show. Sagar and Crystal, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1336.6000000000001s)]
*  I think have done an incredible job. Crystal herself has been like, just downright heroic [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1341.96s)]
*  in her coverage of the the Israel Gaza war over the last year and a half. And I just I watched the [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1348.6000000000001s)]
*  show regularly. I've been on the show, I think a couple times, and I very much enjoy it. So just [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1355.88s)]
*  to say that she now she has been a fierce critic of Elon Musk, and and kind of the, the kind of [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1360.04s)]
*  tech bro billionaire class that's been around Donald Trump. And even within that, even though [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1369.16s)]
*  I've been kind of on the other side of that, and I've been cheering on the efforts of Doge, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1374.68s)]
*  I think it's reasonable that like, there should be left wing journalists who are like, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1379.5600000000002s)]
*  trying to hold his feet to the fire and trying to keep him accountable. You know, as you've said, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1386.92s)]
*  many times on the show before Rob, and I've agreed with you that, look, none of us are arguing that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1391.48s)]
*  there isn't a potential conflict of interest or something like that, or that having powerful [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1397.88s)]
*  billionaires being in charge to some degree of policy is something that you'd have to be, you [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1403.96s)]
*  know, have some realistic concerns about. Of course, Elon Musk is does have contracts with [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1410.2s)]
*  the Defense Department and stuff like that. And so it's like, okay, like, I mean, I think certainly, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1417.4s)]
*  if we were now, by the way, those Rachel Maddow reported this the other day, but [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1422.5200000000002s)]
*  he got them under Joe Biden. So it's not as if whatever it's that the truth is that if you [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1427.4s)]
*  actually examine it and you go, oh, he got government contracts under Joe Biden and still [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1432.76s)]
*  came out against Joe Biden and supported somebody else, I don't think it exactly plays into the [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1437.32s)]
*  narrative that that's his end goal here, right, is like to manipulate government policy for his [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1442.04s)]
*  own benefit. But it is possible. And I certainly think if we were to see, let's say in the next [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1448.28s)]
*  few months, we were to see like a massive increase in like, government contracts going [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1453.64s)]
*  to Elon Musk, we might be like, ah, that's a little funky, you know what I mean? Like you can't [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1459.48s)]
*  have a situation where you just give $100 million to the president, and then you get [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1464.44s)]
*  all of this money in return. Anyway, that's my kind of my preface going into it. The reason why [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1469.0800000000002s)]
*  I actually wanted to respond to this clip is because she invokes anarcho capitalism, at one [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1475.0s)]
*  point, which I just there is like, there's some type of rule of thumb that anytime, like a [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1481.96s)]
*  mainstream person, and when I say mainstream, I just mean like a person with like a huge following [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1491.64s)]
*  or a huge show. Anytime a person with a huge audience mentions anarcho capitalism, they always [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1497.08s)]
*  get it completely wrong. I don't know why that's a law of physics, but somehow it is. But anyway, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1504.2s)]
*  let's play this clip and we can talk through some of these ideas because there actually are a few [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1510.12s)]
*  things in here that I found very interesting that I very much disagree with Crystal on. So let's play [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1514.76s)]
*  the breaking points clip and then we could break some of this down. As we discussed earlier this [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1519.8799999999999s)]
*  week, Argentina's president just hyped a massive crypto shitcoin pump and dump, which effectively [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1525.08s)]
*  robbed his own biggest supporters. The whole thing was ultimately quite similar to the scheme [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1530.36s)]
*  Trump also pulled. And lo and behold, some of the same people were involved in this Argentina [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1534.92s)]
*  Libra rug poll as were involved in the Melania rug poll. YouTube scam investigator Coffeezilla [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1539.16s)]
*  managed to score an interview with one of these fraudsters. And there was a particular part that [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1545.0s)]
*  helped me put together something I've been trying to articulate since the beginning of Trump 2.0, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1549.72s)]
*  whether with regard to Doge, Maha, or the new return to outright colonialism and imperialism. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1553.96s)]
*  The moment came towards the end of the interview after this scammer, his name is Hayden Davis, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1559.24s)]
*  admits that all crypto is quote dog shit. How does he justify it? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1563.0s)]
*  So I just go before we even get into this more, I guess, because I don't think me and you have [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1569.0s)]
*  actually really talked about this on the show. And part of that might just be because I don't [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1575.0s)]
*  really understand it. And I've always I just look, I don't know what is good. I get, by the way, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1581.96s)]
*  like messages all the time, constantly now about people wanting to collab on a meme coin. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1589.64s)]
*  And I don't know what that means. But my answer is always no, because that's insane. And it does. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1598.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm again, I'm just full disclosure here. I'm speaking from a place of true ignorance. Okay. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1607.5600000000002s)]
*  But it all seems like a scam to me. But it seems like one of those scams. That's almost such a [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1613.88s)]
*  scam that I just it's hard for me to work up a lot of sympathy for people if they lose money in it. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1619.56s)]
*  Maybe that's fucked up or wrong. And it does seem to me like my first thought when Trump and [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1625.96s)]
*  Melania were doing the coin thing was I was like, Oh, why are you doing this? I mean, if nothing [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1631.32s)]
*  else like now you're just looking like you're trying to scam your own people, at least it has [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1638.04s)]
*  that appearance. So what's the benefit of doing? I guess the benefit is making money. But like, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1641.8799999999999s)]
*  it just it's like, somebody, look, if you went, and you took your money to one of the major [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1647.48s)]
*  financial institutions that has like an FDIC label attached to it, and even though their investment [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1655.3200000000002s)]
*  side isn't guaranteed by the government, but their banking side is guaranteed by the government, and [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1660.8400000000001s)]
*  it was your job to realize that that FDIC label only meant the banking side and not the investing [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1664.76s)]
*  side. And then you went in there and then they went, Hey, we're going to put you in a very, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1670.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, low risk account with all of these things that have been rated AAA by the government. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1673.72s)]
*  You know, these are excellent mortgage loans or something like that. And then the whole thing [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1679.72s)]
*  goes belly up because it was all like a pyramid scheme. And you're someone's like some old ladies [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1684.68s)]
*  like crying because she lost her entire life savings over that. I have enormous sympathy for [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1689.32s)]
*  that woman who was totally ripped off. But if I went up to an old lady, and she was crying, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1693.88s)]
*  and she I was like, What's wrong? And she was like, I lost my life savings. And I was like, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1699.24s)]
*  Oh my God, what'd you invest it in? And she went, Oh, I bought the Hawk to a girl's meme coin. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1702.28s)]
*  Am I crazy that I'm just like, well, what would you think? I mean, yeah, of course you can't do. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1708.84s)]
*  So anyway, I don't know enough about this. I don't know if you know more than me or you [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1714.04s)]
*  have an opinion, but going into it, I'm totally open to the idea that this is a scam and these [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1717.72s)]
*  guys shouldn't be doing it. I don't know. What do you think, Rob? I agree. That seems like [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1722.36s)]
*  Javier Malé on this one when Hawk to a coin girl but I and at least from the Hawk to a girl, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1728.04s)]
*  it's the fucking Hawk to a girl. Why you taking investment advice from her? I could see why [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1733.8s)]
*  there's a slightly more of a fraud element. Well, all right. Here's the real fraud element [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1737.56s)]
*  is that you think if the government's backing it, that it might become something that the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1742.76s)]
*  government's actually working on. And then same as like the US dollar as currency, because I can use [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1746.44s)]
*  it on my taxes. So you might actually think that there's value there. But then you're still trying [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1751.96s)]
*  to front run the government. It's no different than having gotten suckered into putting all your [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1756.76s)]
*  money into a windmill company, because he thought that the government was going to continue to buy [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1760.2s)]
*  windmills. So it's almost no different than any other government policy that tries to get people [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1764.04s)]
*  excited that the government's backing some particular technology or industry or buying [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1771.48s)]
*  additional defense contracts. It's not that much different, except in this case, I don't know what [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1775.96s)]
*  the inherent value like at least you can argue the plane contracts that got canceled to Boeing [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1781.48s)]
*  that you thought were going to drive profits for Boeing. There's a physical good there. I don't [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1787.32s)]
*  know why he's backing Libra. I don't know anything about it or as to like if it was, you know, if [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1791.88s)]
*  you wanted to claim it was some sort of a payment processing that they were going to incorporate, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1797.0s)]
*  I have no idea. But I don't even know what the argument is for why if you're the leader of a [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1800.52s)]
*  country, you're backing some fringe cryptocurrency. I don't even like it just, it seems to me like you [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1804.92s)]
*  shouldn't do that if you're the leader of a country. So I'll agree with Crystal on that much [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1811.24s)]
*  and with you. All right. Let's hear. There's nothing to agree on. It gets so flagrantly bad. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1815.96s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Yes. That's right. All right. So let's, let's keep like [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1820.68s)]
*  all in massive repeated scans of people using this quote unquote dog shit. Take a listen. What [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1825.56s)]
*  he had to say. I'm very pro getting everything away from regulated markets, but I, but I'm, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1830.76s)]
*  I'm now recognized because I think that that's another game. I think that's an insider game, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1838.44s)]
*  right? Whether it's, it's, it's the Pelosi's of the world or the stock game, that's an insider [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1843.72s)]
*  game too. It's just a different type and people have to be more careful. But capital markets are [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1849.16s)]
*  an insider game. The whole thing is like, I'm, I'm never, nobody's ever going to convince me that [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1854.44s)]
*  it's not rigged. Banks pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year to do illegal shit because they [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1858.76s)]
*  can make more money other ways. Like I could keep going on with, with bullshit after bullshit, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1864.76s)]
*  after bullshit. I think if you're going to die on the sword of meme coins being, you know, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1869.64s)]
*  insider, this or sniping that like you're full of shit because there's every market in the world [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1875.0s)]
*  is like that. That makes a shitload of money. I just, I just want, I just want to put a note [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1880.12s)]
*  in that if your argument for capital markets is, you know, they, they are rigged, that's actually [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1885.08s)]
*  an argument for more regulation against rigging than it is for less. Like you wouldn't look at [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1890.76s)]
*  a rigged game and go, Hey guys, let's take away all the rules we had in place anyway, to try to [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1896.6000000000001s)]
*  stop it getting rigged. Right. Yeah. But then you have to trust, then you have to trust the regulators [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1901.88s)]
*  and most of them are being paid off. And that's been proven time and time forever because yeah, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1906.1200000000001s)]
*  yeah. But, but, but, but, but once again, the conclusion to like seeing problems in the world [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1910.76s)]
*  is not like you realize like your brakes aren't working correctly. It's not to go like, Hey, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1918.28s)]
*  the brake manufacturers paid off. So let's just not have brakes at all. It's going, it's methodically [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1923.0800000000002s)]
*  approaching it and going, okay, we need to advocate for more regulation here. We need to advocate for [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1928.3600000000001s)]
*  more rules here saying like, Oh yeah, it's all rigged. Isn't the dunk that people think it is [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1934.8400000000001s)]
*  on rules in general. Does that make sense? Sure. But it's, it doesn't matter. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1943.0800000000002s)]
*  I can hear go ahead, Rob. You can, you can have the first response. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1948.2s)]
*  Is the guy with the glasses, is that coffee Ziller is that, I don't know. I don't know. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1951.24s)]
*  I think he's no, no, he's, he's the guy who's interviewing one of the guys. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1955.32s)]
*  Okay. What I think he gets incredibly wrong is that the regulation of the stock market, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1960.3600000000001s)]
*  the way that the fed exists, the way the entire game is played is more similar to [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1967.4s)]
*  if you thought you had brakes on your car. And then when you went to press the brain brakes, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1971.72s)]
*  it turns out that you just injected NOS into the engine. And this is the big wet dream of [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1975.72s)]
*  liberals everywhere is that we need, we need government to protect us from corporations, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1982.1200000000001s)]
*  except government is the tools that the corporations use that they don't have to [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1987.4s)]
*  actually compete and create value in the marketplace. And so that they can do everything [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1991.16s)]
*  that the left pretends that they're afraid of corporations doing, which is exploiting us all [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=1995.88s)]
*  for money in an honest market, they have to create value. And that's the only way that they can [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2000.68s)]
*  extract money from you is if they are giving you something of value in return. Government is what [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2005.32s)]
*  steps in and changes the rules of the games that they can just extract wealth. Yes. Look, there's a [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2010.36s)]
*  tendency on people on the left. I see this all the time. In fact, I was just talking with a friend [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2017.1599999999999s)]
*  of mine who's a very smart guy about this, but there's, there was, we were talking about this [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2023.32s)]
*  leftist who basically was arguing that IQ science is junk science. And it's just, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2027.88s)]
*  the interviewer is cooperating according to the chat. Oh, my, my mistake there. Okay. So I'm sorry, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2036.0400000000002s)]
*  but the anyway, just about coffee Zilla, who I never, I think I've heard of before as blast [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2041.0s)]
*  for being a dumb ass. Okay. Well, there you go. So there, but anyway, so as I said, there is this [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2045.5600000000002s)]
*  tendency. So as like IQ science is like very sound, like it's just like IQ is actually like, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2050.6s)]
*  I think the best psychological predictor of future results. Like it's just, it's very sound science. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2057.88s)]
*  And so you wonder like, why is it that this leftist is denying this? And it's just very like people [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2063.48s)]
*  on the left have this tendency to straight up deny something if they get cognitive dissonance over it. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2068.36s)]
*  Like if it challenges their worldview, they're just like, Nope, that's not real. And you could [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2075.08s)]
*  see why they want to deny IQ science because it's just, it's a, it's a nightmare for the egalitarian [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2079.88s)]
*  worldview. You know what I mean? Like if your worldview is essentially that like all people, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2087.4s)]
*  it's just circumstance and just their opportunity and just the amount of wealth that's been [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2091.7200000000003s)]
*  redistributed to them. The IQ science just tears this all apart. And like you could find, you know, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2096.28s)]
*  if you drop somebody into the worst situation, but they have 160 IQ, they're still going to be way [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2100.92s)]
*  better off, you know, like you're just way better off than someone in that exact same situation [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2107.56s)]
*  with a 90 IQ. And there that's, you know, it's anyway, there is, it's like trying to explain [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2111.56s)]
*  this to a leftist and they're just unwilling to adjust their worldview around the obvious fact. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2118.68s)]
*  And so he'll say like, Oh no, granted. Yeah, it's true that like the regulators have been rigged and [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2125.32s)]
*  all of this and like, yes, we can demonstrate this. But if you're, if you're arguing that, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2130.7599999999998s)]
*  then that's not the dunk you think it is. You would just be arguing for more regulation. No, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2135.0s)]
*  you're still stuck in this mindset that the government are the referees in the game. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2139.72s)]
*  Okay. And so you'd want more rules, more referees. The point being made is that government is the [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2145.08s)]
*  referee who's working for one of the teams, who's tripping other players on the other team, you know, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2150.12s)]
*  who's only calling fouls on one side and not calling fouls on the other. And in that case, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2156.36s)]
*  the last thing you'd want to do is give that referee more power. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2161.0s)]
*  That just makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. And so no, the, it is actually a very fair point [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2164.52s)]
*  for him to be like, look, all of these markets are rigged. And if you're just complaining about [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2171.32s)]
*  these markets, you're kind of demonstrating something about yourself because the truth is [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2175.88s)]
*  they're all rigged and the government getting involved further rigs the markets to an extraordinary [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2179.8s)]
*  level that you could never get without the government rigging the markets. I mean, listen, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2187.56s)]
*  use it like anybody who's just like, if you, if you make a little bit of money, I don't even [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2192.36s)]
*  mean like you have real money. I just mean like, if you, if you have a decent salary or something [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2197.16s)]
*  like that, you already know, look, dude, you pay enormously high taxes, right? And then why is it [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2201.7999999999997s)]
*  that everybody, you know, contributes to like their 401k or their IRA accounts or whatever like that? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2208.04s)]
*  Because it's the only way like the government forces you through taxation to put your money [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2214.44s)]
*  into the stock market, like to gamble in wall street, you're forced into that, unless you just [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2220.92s)]
*  go on and get robbed blind. And then they'll be like, Hey, if you gamble it all on wall street, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2226.04s)]
*  if you give your money to wall street for 40 years, we'll let you pay much less taxes on them [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2230.12s)]
*  when you need it to retire. Now think about how much that's just rigging the game for regular [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2236.04s)]
*  people to give their wealth to wall street. Now, I'm sorry, you could refer to those regulations [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2241.32s)]
*  as rules and somehow I'm against rules now, but I am sorry. The only reason, the only reason why [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2246.6000000000004s)]
*  wall street is a multi trillion dollar industry is because the government has, has rigged the [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2253.96s)]
*  game in their favor by the way, at the behest of big bankers, like it's, it's not like a coincidence [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2260.44s)]
*  that the big financial companies have given so much money to politicians. And it's not a coincidence [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2267.8s)]
*  that the treasury secretary always comes from Goldman Sachs or Bear Stearns or whatever. You [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2272.36s)]
*  know what I mean? Like it's, it's obviously a rigged game. So it is not true that pointing that out [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2277.32s)]
*  leads to the conclusion that the government should have more power. That just there's, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2283.8s)]
*  you can't get there logically unless you're just denying the reality of that claim. So this guy [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2288.04s)]
*  gets it all wrong and does not understand what the guy he's interviewing is saying. All right, guys, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2293.5600000000004s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, a brand new sponsor who we're [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2297.24s)]
*  thrilled to have on board. And that is cornbread, cornbread and their wonderful CBD products. Life [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2302.2s)]
*  has been crazy over the last few years. And so people are always looking for something to help [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2309.7999999999997s)]
*  them unwind and cornbread CBD gummies are perfect for that. Cornbread hemp CBD gummies are made to [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2314.12s)]
*  help you feel better, whether it's stress, discomfort, or just needing a little relaxation. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2321.64s)]
*  They only use the best part of the hemp plant, the flower for the purest and most potent CBD. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2326.84s)]
*  You got to go check them out. This is all the rage these days. People love their CBD. And right now, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2333.1600000000003s)]
*  part of the problem listeners can save 30% off their first order. It's an incredible offer. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2338.6000000000004s)]
*  Just head over to cornbreadhemp.com slash P O T P and use the promo code P O T P at checkout. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2344.2000000000003s)]

*  let's get back into the show. And now it's Crystal's turn. Let's go back to the [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2360.44s)]
*  also just to expand a little bit. It's all on the back of fractional reserve banking and the ability [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2364.2000000000003s)]
*  of the, you know, the Fed to bail out Wall Street every single time that they explode one of their [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2369.96s)]
*  credit asset bubbles. And so the point being, if you think you're being protected by government, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2375.2400000000002s)]
*  while it's only throwing fuel on the fire, that's not more helpful. And there are great [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2381.0s)]
*  notes to your example though, right? Like if the brakes don't work and let's say the brakes were [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2385.8s)]
*  intentionally put in as they're not even breaks, they're just pretend breaks that don't actually [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2390.76s)]
*  work. Yes, you're actually a lot better off with a big sign that says this car has no brakes than a [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2395.64s)]
*  big sign that says breaks guaranteed by the U S government. Uncle Sam's got your back dude. Right? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2401.4s)]
*  So like, yes, I think that's a good a good way to put it. Let's keep playing. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2407.4s)]
*  That to me, like that to me is kind of a mute a little bit of a mute point because it's like, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2413.56s)]
*  it doesn't matter the people that have the most money, the most access and the most control, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2417.48s)]
*  which is insiders and any market in the world always win. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2422.92s)]
*  So Hayden basically says, well, mainstream financial markets are scammy too. So I'm going [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2427.2400000000002s)]
*  to get mine with an even more brazen scam. Coffee, of course, correctly points out the answer. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2431.56s)]
*  Financial fraud is better laws, enforcement, less corruption, but Hayden's already made up his mind [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2436.04s)]
*  since the big banks are imperfect. We should just give up on policing things like rugpoles, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2440.68s)]
*  insider trading and outright theft. Now, that philosophy actually seems to me to be pretty core [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2445.16s)]
*  to the ethos of Trump 2.0. It's a dark nihilism that effectively says, look, everything's bad. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2450.2s)]
*  So let's just make it worse. Since the financial system is gained by insiders, let's just go full [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2455.48s)]
*  open scam. Since money has infected politics, let's just take open bribes. Since we've been [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2460.12s)]
*  hypocritical about international law, let's just refer to pure barbarism. It's an ethos that I think [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2465.48s)]
*  is very much at the core of the anarcho capitalist ideology that Elon and project 2025 architect, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2471.16s)]
*  Russ Vogt have infused the second Trump administration with. Let's pause it right there. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2477.0s)]
*  So this is, I'm sorry, but this is just like a blatant straw man of what was just said. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2482.76s)]
*  Nobody's saying like since the first of all, I guess I should address first anarcho capitalist. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2488.44s)]
*  None of them have an anarcho capitalist philosophy. I don't think any of them know [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2495.8s)]
*  what anarcho capitalism is. And what we are seeing today is nothing even remotely close [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2499.08s)]
*  to anarcho capitalism. Again, there is just this thing where it's like, I understand people have, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2503.56s)]
*  and look, I've experienced this too in my day. Sometimes you have like a preconceived notion, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2508.84s)]
*  you have your prior and you find something that challenges it. And there is always kind of the [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2512.92s)]
*  instinct to fit it back into what your preconceived notion was. It's something we all have to be [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2519.32s)]
*  careful about because it's a natural human tendency, confirmation bias and whatnot. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2524.52s)]
*  But it is wild to see that like we're literally the United States of America is the biggest, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2531.0s)]
*  most powerful government in the history of the world. And you're now talking about the [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2537.64s)]
*  people who are presiding over that government. And while it might be fair to say that Malay [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2541.88s)]
*  actually knows what anarcho capitalism is and has read some of their theorists, the idea that like, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2547.1600000000003s)]
*  what's going on here for anybody who doesn't know, by the way, anarcho capitalism, which I'm quite [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2552.6s)]
*  fond of, is the theory is essentially like no government with a capitalist society. So the [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2557.4s)]
*  argument would be that you can have a capitalist society without a government whatsoever, because [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2563.88s)]
*  really by its very nature, a government violates the rules of capitalism, like private property, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2571.0s)]
*  the non-aggression principle, things like that. The idea that we are abolishing government here [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2575.72s)]
*  is just nutty. That is not what anybody is proposing. I wish it were true, but it is not [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2581.8s)]
*  even close to true. But what I think Crystal is getting wrong is that it's not, I don't think [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2586.2s)]
*  it's as simple as saying, well, because the big banks are imperfect, therefore we should embrace [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2592.2s)]
*  outright scams, or because we've been hypocritical about international law, we just shouldn't even [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2598.36s)]
*  listen to it at all. It's more, I think, something like the big banks are a bigger scam than any meme [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2603.48s)]
*  coin could ever be. They are the biggest scam ever inflicted on mankind, and they're only that way [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2611.32s)]
*  because they have the power of the government behind them. Therefore, the last thing you want [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2618.6800000000003s)]
*  to advocate for is more government power. I think that's a better representation of what they're [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2623.0s)]
*  saying. As far as the international law goes, and I was just arguing briefly with Cenk Huger, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2628.52s)]
*  who I also like, from the Young Turks, we were on Piers Morgan together, and it's just funny to me [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2634.68s)]
*  how he's an anti-war lefty, and then when I started trashing NATO, he starts disagreeing with me, and [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2639.72s)]
*  he's like, no, NATO is a good alliance, and it's important. And I'm like, come on, you're an anti-war [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2646.84s)]
*  guy. What are you defending NATO for? It's the European wing of the American Empire. What are [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2651.08s)]
*  you talking about? You know what I mean? And there is something interesting where it's like [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2656.12s)]
*  you find the lefties defending, whether they mean to or not, but in some way defending the big banks [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2660.6s)]
*  or the Federal Reserve system as somehow like, oh, it's imperfect, like a meme coin. That's just a [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2668.92s)]
*  scheme. What is the Federal Reserve? Like, it's not, I'm not dismissing, I'm not trying to play [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2675.08s)]
*  whataboutism or whatever they'd say. I'm not dismissing your concern over the meme coins. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2681.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm saying that like, if you care about a big financial scheme, well, guess what? There's a [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2685.48s)]
*  way bigger one that's backed up with your tax dollars, and maybe that's what we should focus [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2691.08s)]
*  on. And in terms of international law, I mean, look, like, the thing is it doesn't exist. It's [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2696.52s)]
*  not a question of whether you think it should or shouldn't, or whether you think it should be [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2701.72s)]
*  abandoned. There's nothing to abandon. That's the whole point. Think about international law. Is [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2705.7999999999997s)]
*  international law stopping what Israel's doing to Gaza? Did international law stop the US backing [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2710.68s)]
*  the Saudis in their war of genocide against the people of Yemen? No, because international law, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2715.72s)]
*  when you get to the highest levels of power, there's no such thing as law. That's the whole [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2721.56s)]
*  point. The whole thing was always just a euphemism for empire. The US has violated international law [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2726.04s)]
*  constantly throughout my entire life in egregious and blatant ways. But you never even start [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2736.52s)]
*  hearing anything about international law until Vladimir Putin does it. Because then they think, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2742.68s)]
*  oh, it's a tool we could use against our enemies. Essentially, they all have to follow these rules, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2747.08s)]
*  but we don't, which, by the way, is identical to the financial markets. You force the rules on [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2751.8s)]
*  everybody else and you yourself don't have to follow them. So I just think Crystal is [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2758.04s)]
*  misrepresenting what the argument is here and is certainly incorrect about what anarcho-capitalism [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2762.1200000000003s)]
*  is. Is there anything you want to add to that, Rob, or you want to keep playing? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2769.8s)]
*  RG Well, I'm just kind of thinking in my head, you know, idiots are going to idiot. And that [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2772.92s)]
*  doesn't mean that you should go out and scam people. But if someone decides that, you know, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2778.36s)]
*  there's people that lose money in casinos every single year. And I don't know why some people [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2782.6800000000003s)]
*  should have the right to operate a casino and other people shouldn't. It's just that government [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2787.08s)]
*  gives a handout to some people that they get to have the business of a casino and other people [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2790.52s)]
*  can't. If I want to have meme coins and sell you meme coins, and you're a person that wants to buy [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2795.32s)]
*  meme coins, why is a government regulator coming into that market? How does that help? If there's [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2801.8s)]
*  a market for meme coins and people are going to buy meme coins, which is essentially, hey, I'm [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2807.56s)]
*  going to gamble on which one of these artificially goes up and when I could sell it, why does it [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2811.48s)]
*  help to just let single individuals and companies work in that field under the guidance of government? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2816.04s)]
*  It doesn't like- RG Yeah, and if somebody, if an advocate of government intervention is coming [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2821.56s)]
*  around and telling you how awful casinos are and how terrible it is that people lose their money [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2826.92s)]
*  there, it's not unreasonable for me to point out that they have a state lottery, which way more [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2831.56s)]
*  people lose money in. You know what I mean? It's not crazy for me to be like, wait a minute, I don't [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2836.68s)]
*  think you guys actually really care about gambling because you literally have a state lottery that [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2841.24s)]
*  sucks all of these people into, which is a way bigger scam than casinos. And at least, like with [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2845.8799999999997s)]
*  the breaks example, at least the casino is kind of like, it's a little more obvious that it's just a [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2851.0s)]
*  scam. You know what I mean? Whereas with the government, you give people this illusion of [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2859.96s)]
*  it's not a scam. It's not a scam to open a 401k, Rob. That's a responsible investment tool. You [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2866.68s)]
*  know what I mean? And so it's like, no, but you're doing the same thing. In fact, to a much worse [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2873.64s)]

*  And then you look at like healthcare. So I guess you could have products that just don't do [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2941.88s)]
*  anything for you. I sell you flower petals and I tell you they're good for your health and you [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2949.16s)]
*  purchase them. Lavender oil, it doesn't matter. Just something that doesn't work. And then the [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2952.3599999999997s)]
*  worst version of that is I gave you something that can actually be bad for you. And then you go, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2956.12s)]
*  oh, I can't have people just selling things that might actually be bad for people's health. We need [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2959.96s)]
*  a regulator in. But then look at what the regulators have done. They forced people to get COVID [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2963.56s)]
*  vaccines. How's that helpful? And not only that, but they keep products off the marketplace that [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2967.96s)]
*  would be more cost effective or could like, I don't want to sit here researching what peptides [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2972.8399999999997s)]
*  actually have healing properties that the FDA won't allow me to have or whether or not their [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2977.96s)]
*  painkillers are better than like a kratom. But that's the way we work. And are those regulators [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2982.76s)]
*  actually to my benefit? Or would be better if we got rid of that signal completely so that people [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2988.36s)]
*  with better incentives came in to, like I used to keep kosher. There was this organization called [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2994.04s)]
*  the OU. And if you go look at packages, there's a little thing that certifies, hey, that's kosher. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=2998.28s)]
*  Maybe be better off with independent regulators on all this stuff that are actually paid for by [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3003.32s)]
*  the consumers that go, hey, we went in, we did our homework on this. It's actually pretty good [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3007.56s)]
*  for you. Because it seems like the market mechanisms of the government regulators just favor large [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3011.48s)]
*  corporations. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's exactly right. Exactly right. All right. Let's keep lying. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3017.7999999999997s)]

*  the oligarch CEO dictators run wild. Don't believe me? Just listen to Mark Andreessen, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3029.7999999999997s)]
*  as influential a person as any in this administration, explain how, since democracy [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3035.32s)]
*  will always be flawed, we should just openly embrace oligarchy. So the iron law of oligarchy [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3040.04s)]
*  basically says democracy is fake. There's always a ruling class. There's always a ruling elite [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3045.8s)]
*  structurally. And he said the reason for that is because the masses can't organize. Right. What's [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3050.2000000000003s)]
*  the fundamental problem? Whether the mass is 25,000 people in a union or 250 million people in a [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3054.92s)]
*  country, the masses can't organize. The majority cannot organize. Only a minority can organize. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3059.1600000000003s)]
*  And to be effective in politics, you must organize. And therefore, every political structure [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3064.44s)]
*  in human history has been some form of a small organized elite ruling, a large and dispersed [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3069.48s)]
*  majority, every single one. And so basically, the presumption that we are in a democracy is just [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3074.36s)]
*  sort of by definition fake. Now, good news for the US, it turns out the founders understood this. And [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3080.2s)]
*  so of course, they didn't give us a direct democracy. They gave us a representative democracy. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3084.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. And so they built the oligarchy into the system in the form of Congress and the executive [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3087.96s)]
*  branch, the judicial branch. But so anyway, so as a consequence, democracy is always and everywhere [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3092.28s)]
*  fake. There is always a ruling elite. And basically, the lesson of the Machiavellians is you can deny [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3097.7200000000003s)]
*  that if you want, but you're fooling yourself. The way to actually think about how to make a system [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3103.88s)]
*  work and maintain any sort of shred of freedom is to actually understand that that is actually [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3108.1200000000003s)]
*  what's happening. So the basic message here is democracy is fake. So just give up on letting [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3112.52s)]
*  people have a say and embrace your billionaire overlords. You can see how this ideology also [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3117.8s)]
*  tied to the ideas of Nick Lann and Curtis Yarvin, the so-called dark enlightenment or neo-reactionary [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3122.44s)]
*  movements, how this provides a very convenient philosophical backdrop for Elon to execute on his [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3126.84s)]
*  own plans and personally selected goals for humanity. Let's pause it here a little bit. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3131.88s)]
*  Because again, I think Crystal just, she just gets this wrong. And I don't think she's familiar [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3135.7200000000003s)]
*  with the argument that's being made here by Andresen. I always say his name wrong. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3140.92s)]
*  But so he's specifically referring to a book called the Machiavellians, which is a phenomenal [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3146.2s)]
*  book, by the way, I highly recommend everyone read it. And I am not Burnham, who's the author [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3151.16s)]
*  of the book. It was not an anarcho-capitalist. He was like a neo-conservative, essentially. But [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3158.7599999999998s)]
*  so I would disagree with a lot of his political conclusions. But the point that's being made here, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3166.7599999999998s)]
*  the way Crystal says it's like, so it's almost like you see there, democracy is fake, and therefore [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3171.24s)]
*  we should give up on anybody having any say in anything. And that's not the point he's trying [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3177.72s)]
*  to make. It's more like what Burnham is saying is that people have this idea that they're going to [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3183.16s)]
*  live forever, but you're not going to. You're going to die. Like that's the truth of the matter [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3188.7599999999998s)]
*  is that everybody's going to die one day. And so you want to do what you can to escape the [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3195.0s)]
*  life as long as possible. You want to be healthy, blah, blah. It's not saying, oh, because this [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3199.56s)]
*  isn't real, we give up on it or something like that. The point is, as is being made, which I don't [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3203.48s)]
*  actually think there's a counter to, is that he goes, society is always run by elites. And if [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3208.44s)]
*  you're convincing yourself that you live in a democracy, you're just fooling yourself. Like [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3213.7999999999997s)]
*  that's not real. There's no such thing as the rule of the many. Like that just isn't a real thing. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3218.36s)]
*  That's just obviously the case that you give me the example of what government, what governing [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3225.48s)]
*  structure does not have powerful elites that have more influence than the regular person. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3234.52s)]
*  And so then his conclusion from this is that that's why the founders knew this. They limited [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3240.28s)]
*  democracy and they wanted to at least like, okay, we're going to have an oligarchy, but it'll be at [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3246.92s)]
*  least a little bit more of like, okay, here's where we're putting the power. And if we do that, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3251.16s)]
*  we can kind of still maximize freedom. And rather than just fooling ourselves into thinking that any [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3255.72s)]
*  organization, any structure is truly run by the people there. Like this just does not happen at [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3264.44s)]
*  all. In fact, there was, I forget where, what was it? But there was one of these real like commie [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3271.24s)]
*  unions where somebody did a study of it and they even went into the like the most like just all [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3278.44s)]
*  socialists in a union together. And then they figured out that even that had a ruling elite [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3283.64s)]
*  in it. There were like a couple of, there was like a couple dozen people who had risen to the top and [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3288.52s)]
*  were making all of the decisions. It's just any company you're talking about, any country that [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3292.92s)]
*  you're talking about, any group, there are always people at the top of it who are decision makers. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3297.88s)]
*  And you can tell yourself that they're decision makers on behalf of the people. But this is like [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3303.96s)]
*  telling yourself that Joseph Stalin or Mao Tse-Tung were representatives of the people. Like, no, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3310.28s)]
*  they weren't. They were rulers. You know what I mean? And this is true in our society, is true in [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3315.6400000000003s)]
*  every society. And how could you even look at the United States of America and think that that's not [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3320.44s)]
*  the case? Think that, and forget any of the Elon Musk or any of these new class of elites. Obviously, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3324.52s)]
*  this has always been the case in America and everywhere. So again, it's not like an endorsement [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3331.48s)]
*  of that style of government. It's an argument that this is just a recognition of reality. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3339.56s)]
*  And I think that's correct. I mean, I think Burnham is absolutely right about this. Now, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3345.72s)]
*  I think you add that it's not that you can't take that understanding and then have very bad [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3349.8s)]
*  policy prescriptions. I think Burnham himself is guilty of that. But it's just not true that the [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3356.6s)]
*  argument here is like what she's trying to frame both of these arguments as is like, hey, you know, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3363.4s)]
*  I got a cut on my leg, so I might as well break my leg. You know what I mean? But that's not the [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3373.96s)]
*  argument. That's not the argument that they're making. They're not saying like, hey, this is [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3379.88s)]
*  problematic, so we might as well just go all the way. What they're saying is like, there is no leg. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3383.24s)]
*  They're pretending that there's a leg. The leg doesn't exist. You've been lied to. And so stop [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3388.6s)]
*  listening to the person who's pretending reality is something other than what it is. That's much [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3393.3199999999997s)]
*  closer to the argument than like, oh, things are bad, so they might as well be worse, which I think [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3397.7999999999997s)]
*  is how Crystal's taking this. Anything you want to add there? You want to keep applying? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3402.68s)]
*  No, let's keep rocking. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3406.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay. We'll do a little bit more and then we'll wrap it up. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3408.8399999999997s)]
*  So, Elon, he wants total power, and this ideology provides him a pathway to exactly [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3411.0s)]
*  that. I've been reading Walter Isaacson's biography on Elon. One thing you really get is how he has [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3417.8s)]
*  personally cast himself as the savior of humanity, launches SpaceX. That's a sort of insane boondoggle [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3422.84s)]
*  at the start. He believes he must personally guarantee humanity's future as a multi-planetary [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3428.44s)]
*  species. Never mind that none of us voted for the CEO, Dictator King, to destroy the lives of working [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3433.48s)]
*  class people in order to chase his Martian dream. If Elon's multi-planetary goal takes shredding the [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3438.28s)]
*  Constitution, so be it. If it takes sentencing kids with HIV and Africa to death, so be it. If it [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3443.7200000000003s)]
*  takes hijacking the entire resources of the United States government to funnel into SpaceX, so be it. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3448.84s)]
*  We can pause it here. You know what? We could be done with the clip here because I just, listen, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3452.84s)]
*  and I like Crystal, but she's just getting hyperbolic and a little bit, I think, ridiculous on this [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3457.8s)]
*  part. Look, again, this is something that I think the left is very uncomfortable with, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3462.6s)]
*  but it's a fact of reality, is that great men, and when I say great men, I do not mean that [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3470.84s)]
*  morally speaking. I mean great men like men who move history. And so, but in this category would be, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3479.8s)]
*  like, I don't know, whoever, every president of the United States, people who achieve an enormous [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3488.44s)]
*  amount, and including like really evil people, Hitler or Stalin or whoever, the world is moved [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3494.8399999999997s)]
*  by these people. This is just a fact of nature. It's one that makes people uncomfortable, but it's [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3503.48s)]
*  like Pareto distribution type stuff. What are the exact numbers on the Pareto distribution? Do you [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3510.8399999999997s)]
*  know, Rob? But it's something like, yeah, it's like, it's essentially something like a tenth of [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3515.24s)]
*  any group produces 50% of the output or something like that. And the crazy thing about the Pareto [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3522.4399999999996s)]
*  distribution is that then it applies on every level too. So I might have the numbers a little [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3527.9599999999996s)]
*  bit wrong, but it's something like that. But so then like if 10% of people produce 50% of the [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3532.2799999999997s)]
*  production, then within that 10%, 10% of them produce 50% of that. And then within that 10%, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3537.0s)]
*  it's just, it is kind of the way the world works that there. And look, if you just think about it [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3543.48s)]
*  like this, right, there are things all around us that none of us understand. None of us understand. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3547.7200000000003s)]
*  If Nate Barghetti has a great, a great stand up bit about this, but like if me and you, Rob, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3555.32s)]
*  were, got in a time machine and went 400 years ago and had to explain to somebody [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3561.08s)]
*  the technology that we use to do our job, you think about how, how ridiculous it is that we could not [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3568.6000000000004s)]
*  even do it. Like you realize you're like one or two levels from where you're like, I might as well [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3576.2000000000003s)]
*  just say it's magic. I mean, I don't know. I like, I really, I don't even know. And this is, and I'm, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3581.48s)]
*  I'm known by people who listen to my show is like, Oh, Dave's a fairly bright guy who understands a [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3587.2400000000002s)]
*  thing or two about a thing or two. If I had to explain to you any of the, like, I don't even know [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3591.5600000000004s)]
*  what my best, like, what is electricity, Rob? Explain it. You know, like me on the spot for this [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3596.2s)]
*  one. I mean, I'll try. I was like, honestly, if I'm trying, I'd be like, I go, okay, you know, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3605.64s)]
*  you know, lightning, you know, lightning in the sky, you know that. Okay. We harness that [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3611.08s)]
*  and then we run it through wires and it, it can transmit a signal like from one end to the other. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3619.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, like, imagine this one, I have the technical land. It's there's a protons, neutrons, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3630.12s)]
*  and come and with those three things, I mean, but even, even that I would have known protons, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3636.2799999999997s)]
*  neutrons and electrons. And there's, you know, like, I don't know, man, I'm really tapped out. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3642.12s)]
*  Like, I really could not explain it, but yet there is, there are people who do understand it. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3648.04s)]
*  What percentage of us understand that a tiny, tiny fraction, we all use it all the time, but a tiny, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3652.44s)]
*  tiny percent. Now look, when she's talking about Elon Musk, having this like narcissism and believing [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3659.4s)]
*  he it's true. She's right about that. Like he does see himself as like, I'm going to solve the problem [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3664.44s)]
*  of interplanetary living and like, but like, I don't know, they're all like this. They're all [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3671.24s)]
*  like this. Again, it's the same Burnham recognition. It's not an endorsement or a criticism of it. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3678.12s)]
*  It's just a recognition that the, yes, Joe Biden also said he was going to save the soul of America. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3685.8799999999997s)]
*  Right. Barack Obama was on record saying about his election, that this was the moment when the sea [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3692.04s)]
*  level stopped rising. And does it like it was this whole speech, but the most grandiose thing [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3699.8s)]
*  you've ever heard. They all, you know, Hillary Clinton, happy birthday to this future president. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3705.0800000000004s)]
*  They all have these incredibly narcissistic grandiose visions of themselves. But also part of it is [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3709.96s)]
*  because you don't get to that level unless you have that attitude. You know, most of us, most of us, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3716.6000000000004s)]
*  if you ever said like, Hey, do you think you should run the world or you should save humanity? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3722.04s)]
*  We'd be like, what? No, like, I'm not, that's crazy. I'm not that guy. And that's why we're [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3726.12s)]
*  not that, you know, like, that's why we don't end up going down as like the great movers and [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3730.8399999999997s)]
*  shakers of history. So I think a lot of this stuff, sometimes to me, I think it comes down to almost [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmU3A-U0jx8&t=3735.4s)]
