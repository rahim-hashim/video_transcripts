# Dave Smith | Zelenskyy's Strategic Blunder | Part Of The Problem 1237
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc)
*  What's up? What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the Fire, Bernstein, and man, we got a good one to break down today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=12.68s)]
*  How are you, Rob? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=18.72s)]
*  You know, Friday was one of the most exciting media days. We do this all the time. We're [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=20.72s)]
*  commenting on things all the time and it's always exciting. But very rarely do you get [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=24.96s)]
*  a WWF showdown like what we saw in the White House. And I did an episode about it yesterday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=28.8s)]
*  I'm excited to get into it with you now. And we've got fun stuff to get into. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=34.24s)]
*  I mean, it is. Yeah, you really can't kind of overstate how wild it is. Let me just real quick [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=38.72s)]
*  before we get into this, because there's a lot to talk about a couple orders of business. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=44.64s)]
*  I should mention that me and Rob will be in Buffalo, New York on the 6th and the 7th and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=49.84s)]
*  one night only in St. Catharines, Ontario on March 8th. And then coming up a couple weeks [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=58.31999999999999s)]
*  after that, we are back at Laugh Boston in the great city of Boston, Massachusetts. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=66.56s)]
*  Very much looking forward to all of that. Comicdavesmith.com for all of those ticket [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=72.39999999999999s)]
*  links. And of course, I will be returning to the SoHo Forum to debate Alex Norwush on immigration. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=76.24s)]
*  The SoHoForum.org for those tickets. If you want to come, it'll be a live debate in New York City. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=84.96s)]
*  Looking forward to that very much. Okay. So yeah, that was this. It was a pretty incredible [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=90.32s)]
*  moment. And you just like like you said, we do not see things like that ever. I would. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=96.96s)]
*  There's there's so many different angles here to kind of break all of this down. But I guess [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  I would have to say the starting point is that that has got to be the biggest [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=109.28s)]
*  political strategic blunder by Zelinsky that I've ever seen. I've just never seen anything like that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=117.12s)]
*  And I don't, you know, I'm not going to get into like too much psychoanalysis. I like to try to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=123.84s)]
*  stay away from that stuff. I don't I don't know Zelinsky personally. I don't know who was in his [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=129.2s)]
*  ear or why he thought that would be a good move. Perhaps it comes from being on the cover of time [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=134.48s)]
*  and Vogue and just everybody kissing your ass and being treated as this hero internationally [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  for the last three years. Perhaps there were other American politicians who were in his ear, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=146.88s)]
*  encouraging him to do this. But the idea that he would that his move when he is completely [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=154.72s)]
*  dependent on Donald Trump to the point that his life might be on the line, but certainly his nation [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=161.12s)]
*  is. And when you're completely dependent on Donald Trump for your move to be, I'm going to try to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=167.04s)]
*  alpha Donald Trump on national television in a language I don't really speak very well. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=175.6s)]
*  It has got to just be I mean, I've never seen anyone go into anything with a worse game plan [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=183.76s)]
*  on anything. I mean, everybody knows no matter who it is, that is the one way you cannot come [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=187.44s)]
*  at Donald Trump. And he attempted it. It went exactly as you would have predicted. And it really [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=194.96s)]
*  does seem like this was a like a huge fork in the road where things just went in a different [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=203.2s)]
*  direction. I will say overall, I think it's great. And I think it's better for the prospects for peace [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=209.44s)]
*  that Donald Trump is like, screw this guy. But I just I kind of can't get over like, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=214.08s)]
*  what was Zelensky thinking? Well, I think that's the genius of Donald Trump is that he knows [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=220.96s)]
*  television. And I think they did not actually have a deal going in. I know that they're claiming that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  they did. But I saw Zelensky saying last week, it was more of a preliminary discussion. And it seemed [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  like they were assumptively closing him of isn't this great? We got the television cameras here and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=239.68s)]
*  we're ready to get the deal done. The Trump team is claiming that it was a done deal. And they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=244.56s)]
*  wouldn't have brought him in without that. But I'd seen comments from Zelensky beforehand that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  sounded like classic sales. Hey, I got to speak to my wife. I got to talk to my business partner. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=252.96s)]
*  Didn't seem like Zelensky thought it was a done deal. No, I agree with you on that was intending [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=259.6s)]
*  at least to come in and make a last pitch for let's fight him or I need a security guarantee. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=264.72s)]
*  And so they sat him down to go, all right, we're here for the signing. Let's take some questions. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=270.16s)]
*  And I think Zelensky probably has been a difficult partner. And they knew exactly how he would behave. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=275.12s)]
*  And Donald Trump is a genius for putting it on television. And as Zelensky, I was comparing him, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=281.36s)]
*  he's got childhood star energy because they brought him out on the Oscars. They did the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  cover with him. Apparently, the Senate, the Democratic senators sat down beforehand to blow [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=290.08s)]
*  a bunch of smoke up his ass and tell him how great he was. And then he showed up for the Donald Trump [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=294.96s)]
*  meeting. And it was it was, you know, then JD Vance was there playing mom go, how dare you speak to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=299.52s)]
*  your dad this way. And I don't think he could have done anything worse to get more of the American [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=305.28s)]
*  public to go let's just be done with this country. Yep. Yeah, no, I agree with that. And I will say [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=311.36s)]
*  because this seems to be now where the divide is on how we're going to play the clip in a second [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=317.76s)]
*  and kind of go through it because there's some interesting just like kind of analyzing what's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=323.92s)]
*  actually being said and argued over. But I just I know there are people who do not like Donald Trump. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=327.92s)]
*  And no matter what he does, they're going to oppose what Donald Trump just did. I think, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=335.44s)]
*  you know, whatever my own bias opinion, I think me and you have been pretty good about like, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=341.44s)]
*  praising Donald Trump when he does good, criticizing Donald Trump when he does bad. I think it's like [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=349.2s)]
*  it's been a unique challenge in the Trump years, where it feels at times, like about 90% of people [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=354.48s)]
*  are either going to love everything Donald Trump does or hate everything Donald Trump does. And it [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  seems very hard for the people who love Donald Trump to ever admit when he's doing something wrong. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=368.96s)]
*  And for the people who hate Donald Trump, it's like impossible for them to ever admit he did [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=372.8s)]
*  something right. But I will just say, and obviously, I'm, you know, I'm not exactly [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=376.8s)]
*  neutral on this topic. I've been talking about this war for years now on some big platforms. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=383.12s)]
*  And so I have a view going in. But I just could not believe that Zelensky would try I found him [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=388.64s)]
*  to be totally disrespectful. And it was like to an appalling level. Then I'm listen, I'm never [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=396.16s)]
*  somebody who like, first of all, I'm not a suit and tie guy. I don't know, Robin, all of the years [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  that we've known each other, if you've ever seen me in a suit and tie, the the the I put on not [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=408.24s)]
*  even a suit, but I put on a button down and a tie. When I was at at the Reno convention when I was [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  speaking and then introducing Ron Paul, because I just felt like, okay, that's, I got to put on a [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=423.44s)]
*  tie. I'm introducing Ron Paul here. And then like when I've gone to weddings, I'll put on a suit [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=428.88s)]
*  for weddings. That's about the only time you'll ever catch me in a suit and tie. But if I was [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=434.96s)]
*  invited to meet- This is me dressing down for work. Well, if I was if I was invited to go meet the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=440.48s)]
*  president in the Oval Office, I would put on a suit and a tie, because that just seems like the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=446.88s)]
*  most and then I will say this to man. And again, I'm really not, as you know, Rob, like I'm not some [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=452.16s)]
*  conservative in this sense. Like I don't really care about like, you know, like, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  conservatives used to freak out about Obama, because like he had his tie loosened in the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=463.6s)]
*  Oval Office. And they're like, this is disrespectful. I've never been that guy. But I do I will tell you [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=466.88000000000005s)]
*  that when when I mean, he said this publicly on the podcast, but when Rogan said on the last [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  podcast that we we got to do a podcast with Trump and me. And and he we floated out the idea [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=478.24s)]
*  privately a few times. And I never it was never like, oh, this is definitely going to happen. But [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=485.2s)]
*  it was always like, oh, that would be awfully cool if that ended up working out. But there is, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=489.76s)]
*  I mean, a zero percent chance that I would ever refer to him as Donald. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=494.8s)]
*  If we were in that, you know what I mean? Like if I was podcasting with Donald Trump, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=502.32s)]
*  I would never be like, and Donald, you know, like that would be crazy to you know what I mean? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=505.28s)]
*  Like I would call him Mr. President, because that's just like, that's the most basic level [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=509.44s)]
*  of respect that that is expected, I think reasonably. And so for first of all, Thor [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=514.48s)]
*  Zelensky to show up in that outfit, and then repeatedly refer to the vice president as JD, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=521.92s)]
*  as he's arguing with him in the Oval Office, I did find is like, I thought that was like a blatant [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=528.24s)]
*  challenge and and, and like just a show of disrespect that was but then on top of that, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=535.2s)]
*  it's like, look, you do just have to understand. And I'll say this. I don't and we'll play the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=541.36s)]
*  clip in a second. But I do not completely agree with the narrative that JD Vance and Donald Trump [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=546.64s)]
*  were were spinning. I definitely do not agree with the narrative that Zelensky was spinning. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=553.92s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is, is that when you have the President of Ukraine and the President [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=559.28s)]
*  of the United States and the Vice President of the United States and the Secretary of State of the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=566.16s)]
*  United States, in the Oval Office with TV cameras on you, that event is by definition, political. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=569.76s)]
*  This is a political event. And whatever narrative it is that Donald Trump and JD Vance want to [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=579.04s)]
*  present, this is not when you are our fat welfare mom, relying on our money and weapons for your [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=586.16s)]
*  fight, you don't get to come in there and just start like going like, no, no, no, actually, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=594.8s)]
*  your narrative is all wrong. And let me tell you what the real narrative is over here. I mean, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  on top of that, his narrative was more bullshit than theirs was. But the idea that you think it [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  would be on the level of like, if he came in to like, Joe, because, you know, essentially what [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=610.24s)]
*  JD Vance and Donald Trump were saying here was like, JD Vance was saying like, you know, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=614.8s)]
*  the Biden administration didn't even try diplomacy. They just tried to be strong. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  We're actually coming in with diplomacy. We're going to solve this problem. Now. Okay, that may [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=623.52s)]
*  not be like 100% accurate. There's some there's a lot of truth to it. But what, but that's the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=627.52s)]
*  narrative that they're spinning. They're a new administration. They got record high approval [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=633.28s)]
*  ratings for Donald Trump. The old administration is very unpopular. And they're trying to sell it [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  like this. And you don't get in the middle of that to just cut it off and go, no, no, no, no, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=642.32s)]
*  no, no, that's not the narrative at all. This is a failure of Obama, Trump won Biden and now and it's [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=646.0s)]
*  like, no, dude, you don't get to do that. I'm sorry, you're not and Donald Trump's right when [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=652.6400000000001s)]
*  he says you don't have the cards, you're not in a position to be able to do this. Like it would be [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  like if I was like, if I everything fell apart from me, and I'm just sleeping on your couch, Rob, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=664.24s)]
*  and I'm literally like, I'm broke, and I'm just borrowing money from you to eat, and you're giving [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  me a place to sleep. And then like, I go with you to your parents house or something like that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=674.72s)]
*  And I just start talking about what the problem with Rob is. Like, you just be like, what, dude, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=678.88s)]
*  no, like, you're not in a position to do this right now. And so I did think it was, I thought it was [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=684.0s)]
*  like wildly disrespectful and just stupid from Zelensky. And I mean, unfortunately for him, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  you know, JD Vance and Donald Trump are they're a mean combo, dude. Like these guys are good at [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=697.28s)]
*  what they do. And even if you don't think they're good at governing, they're really good at that. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  Whatever that is, you know, which is something that I kind of like have respect and I feel like [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=709.52s)]
*  some understanding of like the battle of in front of cameras arguing about stuff. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=714.4799999999999s)]
*  Man, they are formidable at that. And then again, to be in a language that you don't even really [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=719.52s)]
*  speak. So now you're just messing everything up. I don't know. It was just wild. I do want to play [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=724.72s)]
*  the clip. Anything else you want to add before we play a clip from this altercation? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  We want some clips. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=735.2s)]
*  Okay. Let's go to the clip now. Again, this is the shortened version of it, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=736.64s)]
*  just because it's a little bit too long to play like the whole thing. But let's start getting into [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=741.2s)]
*  a little bit of this and picking it apart. You have the full one. Well, what do we, how long is [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=745.36s)]
*  the full one, Natalie? All right. Let's, let's start playing it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=753.44s)]
*  As we have, I have been to come on. I have actually, I've actually watched and seen the stories [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=763.6s)]
*  and I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour. Mr. President, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=770.4000000000001s)]
*  are, do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people in your military? And do you [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=775.6s)]
*  think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=780.64s)]
*  the administration that is trying to, trying to prevent the destruction of your country? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  A lot of questions. Let's start from the beginning. First of all, during the war, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=789.68s)]
*  everybody has problems, even you, but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  in the future. You don't know that. God bless. God bless. God bless. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=801.28s)]
*  All right. So let's pause it right here. So this was just to be clear at this moment. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=804.88s)]
*  This was, yes, this was after there, the, you know, it's fine. This is actually a good place [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=809.44s)]
*  to play it from what it starts with. So Linsky giving a long lecture to JD Vance, which JD [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=814.6400000000001s)]
*  responded like this, but this is the moment. And I will say, man, one thing about Donald again, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=819.44s)]
*  whatever you feel about Donald Trump in any other environment, this is the, his true talent. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=825.7600000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is just when the cameras are on and it comes to who's going to be the biggest alpha in [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=833.9200000000001s)]
*  the room and who's going to like sell himself that there is just no one on Donald Trump's level. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=838.64s)]
*  And so he sits there and he does it just right. He lets his pit bull argue with this guy for a [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=844.16s)]
*  while. And then he's sitting there the whole time. You can tell. And I remember watching that, like [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  I watched this as it was happening and you just know, you're like, Oh, like this ends with Donald [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=853.28s)]
*  Trump being the dominant one in the room. He's sitting there letting them fight and picking his [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=859.12s)]
*  spot. And that was the spot he picked. Cause for Zelinsky to come over here and start saying this [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=863.2s)]
*  utter, like, first of all, you know, there's something so condescending about, you know, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  we all have problems. You have your big oceans and that's nice. And it's like, dude. And then, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=873.36s)]
*  but then for him to say, which essentially, by the way, what he's saying in kind of broken English [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=878.32s)]
*  has essentially been the, the war cry from the very beginning about this, just like all these [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=883.5200000000001s)]
*  wars always have their bullshit propaganda is that if we don't stop Vladimir Putin now, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=889.76s)]
*  you're going to feel it too. And you're going to bet. But what he's essentially saying here is what [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=894.56s)]
*  that Donald Trump, your plan right now is going to end in disaster for America. You're going to be [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=899.6s)]
*  feeling this soon. And that's, first of all, I'm sorry, this is just ridiculous. You know, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=905.92s)]
*  I was just on, I was just on with a Pierce Morgan show before we started recording too, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=911.68s)]
*  and arguing with a couple of these dummies. And they always, it's like the same thing [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=915.36s)]
*  every goddamn time, every war, I just, I'm old enough. I've lived through so much of these now. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=920.16s)]
*  It's always, if you don't fight this war, then this disaster comes, you know, like if we don't [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  fight the war in Iraq, then he's going to hang on the weapons that he doesn't have off to the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=931.44s)]
*  terrorists that he hates. It's just ridiculous, but that's how they sold it. And this one has [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=935.2s)]
*  always been that then he's going to invade Poland and then he's going to take on NATO countries. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=940.4s)]
*  And then America's going to have to be in a direct war with Putin, but just none of it logically [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=945.36s)]
*  follows. There's no reason to think that if Vladimir Zelensky loses control of Luhansk, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=950.16s)]
*  therefore America will feel pain. Like what? How does that even, I mean, like I'm not saying [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=958.56s)]
*  it's impossible, but why would we take that as a given? It makes no sense at all. And again, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=965.68s)]
*  the argument of being like, it is literally like, Rob, if you don't buy my groceries and give me a [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=972.8s)]
*  place to live, then you're going to feel a lot of pain is just not a compelling argument for why we [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=979.52s)]
*  should give somebody welfare. And I thought it was crazy that he said that. And then you could tell [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=985.1999999999999s)]
*  as soon as he said that you were like, Oh, you just activated Trump. You're in trouble now. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=990.24s)]
*  All right. So yeah, let's play. Let's play Donald Trump's response. Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Rob. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=994.64s)]
*  Zelensky is sitting there and he's trying to play the card of, Hey, I'm doing you the favor here. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=999.0400000000001s)]
*  And he clearly isn't. And that's where Trump finally steps in to go. How dare you? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1003.12s)]
*  We are completely fine. We do not need you. We will be okay. And speaking to your other point of [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1007.9200000000001s)]
*  if we don't stop Putin there, he's going to go take over the world. That is going to age about as [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1013.9200000000001s)]
*  well as the domino theory in Vietnam. And for everybody who is claiming, Oh, we are going to [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1019.2s)]
*  end up in a war with Putin. I mean, I really just have two questions that no one has yet to [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  articulate. One is what is the pathway to victory of giving more arms to Ukraine? What, what exactly? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1030.56s)]
*  Cause we're bleeding ourselves dry and spending money too. So it's not like we provoked a war [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1039.1200000000001s)]
*  between an enemy and some random people and they're both going to fight each other. And that's how we [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1043.28s)]
*  crowed the empire. We're not doing that because we're involved here and we're spending our money. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1047.12s)]
*  So what is the pathway to victory? And then if it becomes that we're trying to escalate it, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1051.52s)]
*  how do you have a war with Russia that doesn't end up in nuclear war? So I don't even understand [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1057.04s)]
*  for the people that want to remain in this war and they don't want to acknowledge how many people [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1061.6s)]
*  have died for absolutely no reason. And that Putin is just slowly taking territory. And if anything, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1065.28s)]
*  your entire agenda was to show people how mighty America is and that you can add the sanctity of [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1070.4799999999998s)]
*  borders. You've provoked the opposite where now you've showcased, oh no, you can get away with land [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1074.88s)]
*  grabs and actually walk away with some goodies that might have been, that might pay off the war [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1080.0s)]
*  debts because there's trillions of dollars worth of rare minerals there. So, and we're coming to [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1083.68s)]
*  a point now where it does actually feel like the most insane claim I heard that was opposing this [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1088.8000000000002s)]
*  war was that it would be the end of NATO. And I got to say if after Zelensky showed up here and [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1092.88s)]
*  he was this disrespectful and then he goes cries to Europe and Europe goes, we're going to back you. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1097.7600000000002s)]
*  I don't know why we wouldn't turn around and go, fine, you guys are on your own and we're [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1102.32s)]
*  getting out of this NATO thing. So I, but for everyone that is still backing this talking point [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1105.2s)]
*  of, and now they're trying to sell the, well, you see Donald Trump's been working for Russia [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1112.56s)]
*  the whole time, which I knew they would go with that nonsense, but can anyone articulate a pathway [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1116.56s)]
*  to victory of why spending a single extra dollar for more Ukrainians to die makes any sense? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1121.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, that's no, nobody can. No, I was on with a general on Piers Morgan today. They've nothing, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1128.8s)]
*  they have no like, and again, and they all do this thing, which it just like reminds me of the, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1135.04s)]
*  the, during the, the vaccine passport debate over the, the COVID jab. I don't know. I, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1141.52s)]
*  people give me shit for calling it a vaccine. I understand. But the, like, and they would be like, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1147.1999999999998s)]
*  well, we can't have the unvaccinated in the same room as the vaccinated because then that's a risk [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1152.96s)]
*  to the vaccinated. And you'd be like, wait, I'm sorry. This logic just falls apart right on its [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1159.2s)]
*  own. If the vaccine is so effective that we need to force people to get it, then shouldn't the [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1164.24s)]
*  vaccinated people in the restaurant be safe from the unvaccinated people coming in, sitting in the [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1168.64s)]
*  restaurant. But it's like the same thing with this war. And this has been true the whole time [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1173.68s)]
*  where they're like, we're winning. We're beating Vladimir Putin. Look, he's so weak. Also, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1178.16s)]
*  he's a threat to take over all of Europe. You're like, well, which one is it? Which one is it? Is, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1185.68s)]
*  is he the guy who's so weak that he can't take Ukraine? Or is he the guy who's going to take [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1191.68s)]
*  Poland next? Which one? It can't be both of those. It's gotta be one or the other. And then he's such [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1196.48s)]
*  an evil madman that he doesn't care. He wasn't provoked. He did it just for nothing, but he'll [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1202.4s)]
*  never use nukes. We don't have to be worried about the threat of nuclear war. It's just all of this [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1206.4s)]
*  makes no sense. It's been true from the beginning of this war. All right, guys, let's take a moment [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1210.48s)]

*  yeah, just just while but here, let's play Donald Trump's response to Zelensky. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1289.12s)]
*  Phil, we're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel. I'm not telling you [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1296.2399999999998s)]

*  You will feel influenced. You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1313.28s)]
*  be in a very bad position. That is happening to be right about from the very beginning of the war. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1318.24s)]
*  You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1322.8799999999999s)]
*  cards. Right now, you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1327.92s)]
*  War Three. You're gambling with World War Three. And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1336.56s)]
*  country. This country that's back to you far more than a lot of people said they should have. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1344.08s)]
*  Have you said thank you once this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said thank [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1349.9199999999998s)]
*  you? You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October. Offer some words of [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1354.56s)]
*  appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1360.32s)]
*  Please, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can speak loudly? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1367.52s)]
*  He's not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble. Can I answer? No, no, you've done a lot [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1373.44s)]
*  of talking. Your country is in big trouble. I know. You're not winning. You're not winning this. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1378.1599999999999s)]
*  You have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us. Mr. President, we are staying in [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1384.08s)]
*  our country, staying strong from the very beginning of the war. We've been alone and we are thankful. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1388.6399999999999s)]
*  I said thanks. You haven't been alone. We gave you through the stupid president $350 billion. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1394.08s)]
*  We gave you military equipment. You men are brave but they had to use our military. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  What about West Virginia? If you didn't have our military equipment, if you didn't have our military [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1406.96s)]
*  equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks. In three days. I heard it from Putin. In [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1412.3999999999999s)]
*  three days. This is something new. Maybe less. In two weeks. Of course, yes. It's going to be a very [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1417.9199999999998s)]
*  hard thing to do business like this. I'll tell you. To say thank you. I said a little time. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1422.4s)]
*  Except that there are disagreements and let's go litigate those disagreements rather than trying [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1427.76s)]
*  to fight it out in the American media when you're wrong. We know that you're wrong. But you see, I [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1434.64s)]
*  think it's good for the American people to see what's going on. I think it's very important. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1439.1200000000001s)]
*  That's why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful. You don't have the cards. You're [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1443.44s)]
*  buried there. People are dying. You're running low on soldiers. Listen. You're running low on [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1450.0s)]
*  soldiers. It would be a damn good thing. Then you tell us, I don't want to cease fire. I don't want [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1456.48s)]
*  to cease fire. I want to go and I want this. Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I'd tell [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1462.08s)]
*  you you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed. Of course we want [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1468.48s)]
*  to stop the war. But you're saying you don't want to cease fire. I want a ceasefire. With guarantees. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1472.8s)]
*  Because you'll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement. Ask our people about [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1477.2s)]
*  ceasefire. What do they think? That wasn't with me. That was with a guy named Biden who was not a [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1480.72s)]
*  smart person. That's enough of this clip. There's just so much to break down here. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1488.56s)]
*  This is part of the thing too. You're like, dude, to go at Trump in this manner, he's interrupting [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1497.04s)]
*  every sentence. I'm sorry, dude, but there is just a scenario where Trump says you don't have the [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1503.04s)]
*  cards. He's right. You do not have the cards. You're not in a position to be able to be trying to [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1510.6399999999999s)]
*  interrupt Donald Trump and show him up. You got to be gracious here. You're just not, I don't know, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1516.56s)]
*  you're not in a situation to do this. For him to be making these arguments that they were at it [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1522.8s)]
*  alone. It's bonkers. This makes no sense. He's even arguing with him where [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1530.96s)]
*  Donald Trump says the last stupid president and he goes, you voted for him. What are you doing here, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1538.4s)]
*  dude? First of all, Donald Trump didn't vote for him. Second of all, I don't know how much you keep [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1543.8400000000001s)]
*  up. Zelensky, Donald Trump is not exactly a big believer in what happened in 2020 in terms of the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1549.44s)]
*  election. Regardless of any of that, what are you trying to do? Win the moment here? What's the [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1556.48s)]
*  best case scenario? You dunk on this guy and then what? Then he's going to want to help you because [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1563.92s)]
*  you embarrassed him? Just crazy. It was just crazy. I don't know, dude. Like I said on Twitter, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1569.52s)]
*  cocaine is a hell of a drug. I don't know what the hell this guy was thinking. But man, the thing is [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1575.84s)]
*  that it kind of does work out great. Ultimately, we can get into that. But I don't know, Rob, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1581.04s)]
*  any other thoughts on this interaction here? It's even better on a second watch. And Zelensky's, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1584.72s)]
*  I mean, this is literally me when I got caught in high school spending my parents' money on marijuana [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1591.44s)]
*  and you got to sit down with them and they're giving you, there's nothing you can say, but you [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1596.16s)]
*  just got teenage energy and you'll say whatever. That's what he's doing. He's just sitting there. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1599.76s)]
*  He's been called into the principal's office. He's trying to spin whatever he can. And Donald [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1604.72s)]
*  Trump's just too good that even his little comedic trick of, you don't have to yell at me. He's not, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1609.2s)]
*  he's not yelling. That's not loud. I'll show you loud. I mean, Donald Trump just jumped right on [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1613.52s)]
*  that. He didn't give him an inch. And I mean- But Rob, just to the point, because I think that's a [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1618.48s)]
*  great analogy and that's exactly, but I'm saying like little things, even when, look, you're not [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1624.0s)]
*  here for a confrontation. You're here to beg for more help. And in that situation, even if, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1628.96s)]
*  if you don't like it and you're losing and JD Vance goes, have you even said thank you? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1636.0s)]
*  Like one time your response can't be, I said it lots of times, like, what are you doing here? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1640.72s)]
*  You're trying to battle. You're trying to win. The response to that should be, it should be, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1645.76s)]
*  you know, something like I have said thank you many times, but if that has not been clear, then [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1650.08s)]
*  sincerely to you, Mr. Vice president and to you, Mr. President, thank you for what you know, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1653.68s)]
*  what I'm saying. Like you, your goal here is to win them back over, not battle them at every single [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1657.92s)]
*  turn. It's just crazy. But yes, and I'm sorry, continue. And I guess if you break it down when [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1664.4s)]
*  he's trying to negotiate for is more of a commitment from us for what we can't do. We [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1669.28s)]
*  can't have Ukraine and NATO. That's what started this mess was Biden's stupidity of saying Ukraine's [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1675.2s)]
*  going to be a NATO. So that's not on the table. And it's true. There could probably be a ceasefire [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1680.8799999999999s)]
*  fire tomorrow and Zelensky's in the way because he wants some sort of a security guarantee from [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1685.92s)]
*  the U S or a commitment for more money. But what cards does he have to negotiate that if we're [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1689.52s)]
*  saying no. So yes, Zelensky is literally sitting there and getting in the way of peace. And that's [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1694.0s)]
*  what Donald Trump's calling him out for is that we could have a ceasefire. And he goes, well, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1698.0s)]
*  it's a ceasefire without you guaranteeing me more free stuff. You're not in a place to ask for more [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1701.44s)]
*  free stuff. We're offering you a way out here. We can discuss a way to get this done. And by the way, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1706.16s)]
*  you know, I was giving Trump a hard time last week over the mineral deals. It actually, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1711.36s)]
*  there's a problem at the moment that things are kind of half reported. But from what I'm [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1716.72s)]
*  understanding, it would seem like it was a fair deal of that we were just guaranteeing a right to [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1721.28s)]
*  buy the minerals and then 50 percent of that country was going to remain in U.S. control to [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1726.64s)]
*  be reinvested in Ukraine to essentially, it seems like just guarantee that the money wasn't just [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1731.1200000000001s)]
*  stolen and we have to spend more money over there so that they would actually be built in funding [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1737.0400000000002s)]
*  for security or other purposes controlled by the U.S. That isn't actually well, it's actually our [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1742.4s)]
*  money, but it's our money being spent for minerals as opposed to handing to them to be lost. But just [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1746.96s)]
*  the point being, Zelensky does seem to be showing up trying to figure out how to provoke and remain [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1753.12s)]
*  in this war and force either us or Europe to be paying for it. And, you know, throw them out, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1760.0s)]
*  end the relationship. And if you're, I said it's like the scene in Casino when Sharon Stone goes [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1767.1999999999998s)]
*  and sucks Joe Pesci's dick and then Joe Pesci turns around and goes, man, that was a mistake. I never [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1773.12s)]
*  should have gotten, I never should have got involved with this crazy broad. And I think that's what [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1777.6s)]
*  Europe's about to discover. Yeah, hopefully, hopefully you're right. I mean, it is like, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1781.28s)]
*  this is like, again, I think what so much of the corporate media and the people who hate Donald [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1787.44s)]
*  Trump are almost overlooking here. But it's like, again, you're in no right. Like you said, you're [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1793.2s)]
*  just asking for more free stuff. And what is it you don't like? He goes like, well, I'd like a [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1798.3999999999999s)]
*  ceasefire, but we can't do ceasefire without security guarantees. And ask the Ukrainian people, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1803.12s)]
*  they want security guarantees. And you're like, who cares? Who fucking, of course they do. All [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1808.4s)]
*  people want a security guarantee. I don't know. But none of us actually have one. Like this is, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1813.92s)]
*  it's all like, you know, I was arguing on, on Pierce Morgan's show today with the general [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1819.52s)]
*  about this where it's like, well, we can't end the war because how do we know Putin won't start the [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1823.3600000000001s)]
*  war again? Then you're back in place. What? Yeah, right. Like that is not just logically, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1829.68s)]
*  that doesn't follow. It's like, well, then I guess there's never a justification for ever ending a [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1835.52s)]
*  war ever. Cause hey, who knows? We could be back at war. But if the worst case scenario is we're [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1840.96s)]
*  back where we are now, that's not a good reason to stay where we are now. So, but also like, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1845.92s)]
*  you know, like when you really like, what is a security guarantee exactly? Like, what does that [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1852.4s)]
*  mean? I mean, like a security guarantee, all that that really means is that we're willing to fight. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1857.6s)]
*  That we're, you know what I mean? Like we're willing, you know, if I, if I, like I do my best [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1865.2s)]
*  to guarantee the safety of my, my wife and kids, but that just means that if there's a threat, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1870.88s)]
*  I will do everything in my power to fight it. And that doesn't mean I'll win. There's no guarantee [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1876.5600000000002s)]
*  might be more force than I can defensively muster up. So then shit, you know, I mean, like, and so [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1881.76s)]
*  for, for him to say that you're, you're demanding a security guarantee. Well, what exactly do you [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1887.6000000000001s)]
*  mean by that? That we, I mean, look, we could, I'm pretty sure we could guarantee Ukrainian [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1892.64s)]
*  security, not guarantee, but like we could, if we sent in the 82nd airborne, we could repel the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1899.3600000000001s)]
*  Russians out of Ukraine. We are not willing to do that. And that's the truth. How do you know that [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1905.8400000000001s)]
*  that doesn't escalate to a war with Russia? Well, that's why we won't do it. Right. Yes. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1913.2800000000002s)]
*  We have a direct confrontation of sending an hour military into Ukraine to be on the border with [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1917.92s)]
*  Russia. Yeah. It's not. Strikes on America. And, and you know, there's a funny thing here, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1923.6000000000001s)]
*  because I wanted to make this point on Piers Morgan today. I didn't get a chance to do it, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1929.92s)]
*  but there's a funny thing here where nobody is taking that position. Nobody is saying, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1933.2s)]
*  oh, we could just do this. We could go with, nobody is actually willing to look at the American [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1938.8000000000002s)]
*  people and say, you have to send your sons over to fight and die in a direct, a direct war with [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1943.68s)]
*  the biggest nuclear superpower in the history of the world to protect the Donbass region. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1951.52s)]
*  You know, like that's, I'm sorry, we do not want to do that. And after getting hundreds of billions [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1956.88s)]
*  of dollars, you're going to sit here and demand essentially not demand that right now, but demand [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1963.52s)]
*  the threat of that demand that we, which is the only way that America can effectively give a [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1970.08s)]
*  security guarantee is to say, we'll go to war. We'll go to war over this. Like what else are we [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1974.6399999999999s)]
*  doing saying, Hey, we really don't want you to do that. That's what we did. That was what we did for [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1980.96s)]
*  Ukraine already. The view through the whole lead up to the war in Ukraine. And I like to bring this [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1987.52s)]
*  up a lot because I think it's pretty relevant. And, and, and, you know, look, again, I know I, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1994.48s)]
*  I'm probably guilty of patting myself on the back a little bit too much, but I don't know, me and you, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=1999.28s)]
*  Rob, we're just right about all the most important issues. And so I can't, I can't help but point this [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2004.4s)]
*  out. I've been now for the entirety of the war. I have been one of the guys on the biggest platforms [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2008.72s)]
*  talking about the history of it, the conflict, what led to it, all of this stuff. And we were all like, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2014.48s)]
*  and I'm not even close to like the, the best, you know, there's John Mearsheimer and Jeffrey [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2021.04s)]
*  Sachs and Scott Horton. And there's a lot of great guys who have been kind of talking about this from [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2026.88s)]
*  before the invasion in 22, but Stoltenberg, the chancellor of NATO, he said that in late 2021, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2031.7600000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin sent a, he actually put a treaty, he drafted a treaty and sent it to NATO and said, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2042.24s)]
*  straight up, I will not invade Ukraine if you just put in writing that you guarantee you won't [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2050.56s)]
*  bring Ukraine into NATO. And like, that's the deal that was on the table. Ukraine would have kept [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2057.04s)]
*  everything, no invasion, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people's lives would have been saved. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2065.2s)]
*  They would have had to give up Crimea and they would have kept everything else. And all we would [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2072.16s)]
*  have had to do was say, we're not going to bring Ukraine into NATO, which by the way, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2076.96s)]
*  we're still not going to end up doing, except now the deal is so much worse. Now for Ukraine, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2080.4s)]
*  the deal is going to be giving away probably 20% of your country, maybe more. We'll see 20% if Russia [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2087.44s)]
*  will allow you to do that. Crimea gone forever. And you're still not getting any security guarantees. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2094.08s)]
*  And so for Zelensky to be demanding this, anyway, my point is just like, once again, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2101.7599999999998s)]
*  if you had listened to all the anti-war voices, just objectively, we were right. These guys were [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2107.04s)]
*  wrong. And all of their bullshit war propaganda about how Ukraine can win. I mean, do you even [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2113.52s)]
*  remember Rob, when Vladimir Putin first invaded in 22, the talking point that Joe Biden repeated [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2118.3199999999997s)]
*  over and over again was that we could defeat them with sanctions that we wouldn't even need to send [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2124.16s)]
*  weapons that we could defeat Russia with sanctions. This is what they just over. And anyway, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2129.92s)]
*  they kept the whole war going this entire time. And so whatever, it's been a complete disaster. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2135.36s)]
*  But one of the good things about this, as you kind of said just now, Rob, you're like, the answer is [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2140.8s)]
*  dump this guy. And this is one of the things where I think that like Donald Trump, as is typical with [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2146.88s)]
*  him, even when he is instinctually correct, like when his gut essentially leads him in the right [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2153.44s)]
*  direction, he's not philosophically correct. And he's not well read. And so even when his gut [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2161.76s)]
*  is like, kind of right, his instincts are correct, but because he's he doesn't have like a solid [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2172.2400000000002s)]
*  like theory around the whole thing. And because he doesn't have like a deep understanding of the [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2179.76s)]
*  issue, he can be pulled in bad directions. And so Donald Trump will look at say, like, just like [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2186.4s)]
*  the terror wars. And he'll be like, wait a minute. So you're telling me we occupied Afghanistan for [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2192.4s)]
*  20 years, we occupied Iraq for 20 years, we spent $8 trillion, and we got nothing to show for it. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2199.5200000000004s)]
*  You know, and like, he'll just be like, that's bad business. Then you're like, okay, that is correct. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2205.6s)]
*  You got it right. Now, he doesn't have like this theory to go with it. You know what I'm saying? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2209.7599999999998s)]
*  He doesn't have like a theory of like, what is a just war? What is a war of choice versus a war of [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2215.44s)]
*  necessity? What is a war of aggression? What is a constitutional war? What you know, like, that's not [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2220.7999999999997s)]
*  how Donald Trump's mind works. This just business, right? This is bad business. This is a stupid [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2225.7599999999998s)]
*  decision. And so and on top of that, it's not like he really has a deep understanding of the issue. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2231.04s)]
*  Like he doesn't really understand that like, oh, the neo conservatives and the lekudniks had this [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2236.88s)]
*  plan to topple all of these regimes. And then they use 911, they use the terrorists that they [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2241.52s)]
*  pissed off into attacking us as the you know, like, that's not where Donald Trump's mind is. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2245.92s)]
*  But the problem with that, look, it's still better than anything we've had from a president in my [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2251.04s)]
*  lifetime by far. But the problem is that when it's instinctual, and it's not married to like [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2255.84s)]
*  philosophy and knowledge, then if Donald Trump's like, oh, this is stupid, we shouldn't even be in [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2263.44s)]
*  Syria, you know, why are we even fighting this war? They go like, well, what if we took the oil? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2269.52s)]
*  And he goes, hmm, all right, now that's slightly better business. You know what I mean? Like, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2274.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's very easy for him to get sucked into things like that. And so I think in this case, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2278.96s)]
*  Donald Trump was kind of presenting to Zelensky, like, look, do this mineral deal in Donald Trump's [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2284.72s)]
*  mind, he goes, now we get something out of it. This isn't like bad business anymore. Now it's [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2291.3599999999997s)]
*  just a business deal where there's some benefit to us. And also now, like, since we're in business [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2296.24s)]
*  with you, doesn't that kind of give you a little bit of a security guarantee? You know, because [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2301.52s)]
*  what Putin's messing with you now he's messing with us. But the truth is, that's just all a bad idea. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2307.04s)]
*  Like, the whole point is that we don't want to put ourselves in that position. Why would we want to [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2314.48s)]
*  put ourselves in that position? Why would we ever want to say, we will inherit all of your problems? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2319.36s)]
*  That just doesn't make any sense. Like, it's like, like, look, man, I don't know, I like I want [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2325.76s)]
*  everyone's everyone to have a happy marriage, or a happy life or a happy whatever, you know, success [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2332.08s)]
*  in their career. Hey, I hope everyone does well. Right. But like, I would never say to somebody [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2338.96s)]
*  else, hey, if your marriage falls apart, my marriage falls apart, too. I'm tied right there [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2344.48s)]
*  with you, you know, like, I want to be if your wife cheats on you, then I'll take that as if they [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2350.48s)]
*  cheated on all of us or something like that. It's like, this just does not make any sense. We don't [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2356.7200000000003s)]
*  want to be in these entangling alliances. This is how you never stop fighting wars. When you decide [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2361.2s)]
*  you're going to inherit the problems of everyone all around the world. Like, I don't know, there's [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2366.88s)]
*  a bunch of small states that used to be Soviet satellites that are now quasi independent or [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2371.04s)]
*  American sock puppets or whatever. There's these little states next to Russia, and they got to deal [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2378.4s)]
*  with that. And yeah, that sucks. I don't know. A lot of them are concerned about that. This is always [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2384.56s)]
*  every debate that I have on this topic. It's always like the retort from the people who have been [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2389.28s)]
*  pushing this war. Look, why do you think it is that all the Baltic states wanted to join NATO? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2393.44s)]
*  Yeah, obviously, because they got Russia next to them, and they'd love a big superpower to guarantee [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2399.36s)]
*  their security. But that doesn't mean that it's in our interest to do that. And so that what's great [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2404.64s)]
*  about this happening, why I think this is such a positive ultimately, is that maybe what Donald [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2410.32s)]
*  Trump said at the end there ends up being the final thing. I guess it's impossible to do business [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2415.44s)]
*  with this guy. Okay, so how about this? No mineral deal, no security guarantee, you get nothing. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2419.84s)]
*  Why is that so crazy? How about you get nothing? Okay, we will negotiate with Vladimir Putin [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2428.2400000000002s)]
*  to a peaceful resolution to this war, and you will fucking take it. Because what are you going to do? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2435.28s)]
*  Nothing. I don't know what to say. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2443.76s)]
*  And if you don't, Europe are on your own. I mean, if we go, hey, we're out of this mess, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2449.1200000000003s)]
*  we're not funding it, and Russia agreed to a ceasefire, and you want to continue it, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2454.0s)]
*  and then Europe steps in and goes, well, we'll back the effort, just be done with all of it. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2458.48s)]
*  I'm not going to go read up on what even the propaganda pitches for NATO, which I assume it's [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2462.96s)]
*  less people are spending money on arms, and we've got allies. But I look at the charts of how much [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2469.44s)]
*  money we're spending on essentially European security defense. And I don't understand it. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2474.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No. I can't give you a gut shot like, oh, that makes sense. It certainly doesn't seem [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2481.2000000000003s)]
*  practical. Yeah, what was the I always blank on the title of this piece, but I want to see if I [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2486.6400000000003s)]
*  can pull it up right now. But the Bill Buckley piece, because it's totalitarian bureaucracy. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2493.36s)]
*  Natalie, I'm sorry. I can't multitask for shit. But can you just look up Bill Buckley [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  totalitarian bureaucracy and see what's the first hit that you get on that? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2511.52s)]
*  Um, because this is like, by the way, it's the same because when you say like, what is the official [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2519.04s)]
*  propaganda for what NATO even is? Okay, there we go. Yeah. Yes, this is it. It was. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2524.4s)]
*  Oh, what was it? So right wing critics of Americans concern. Oh, yeah. No, I'm sure. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2532.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's got it right there. It's called the party and the deep blue sea, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2537.2799999999997s)]
*  which was a piece that Buckley wrote in 1952. So if you think this is 1952, this is seven years [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2542.1600000000003s)]
*  after World War Two wrapped up now. The so anyway, the two things are somewhat similar, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2549.0400000000004s)]
*  but in this piece, Bill Buckley, essentially, he starts out by arguing that essentially libertarians [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2556.0800000000004s)]
*  are right. That he's like, listen, you know, libertarianism. I mean, he, I don't think he [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2564.4s)]
*  would have called it that because that wasn't the term at the time, but he was basically like, look, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2570.32s)]
*  you guys are right. The people who believe in individual liberty and limited government, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2574.96s)]
*  you guys are correct. And he says some beautiful things like the first paragraph or two, you'd be [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2579.2000000000003s)]
*  like, oh my God, is this guy an anarcho capitalist? Like, he's just like, he's totally one of us. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2584.48s)]
*  And so he's talking about, he's like, listen, the greatest battle in human history is between [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2589.28s)]
*  tyranny and liberty. The greatest instrument of tyranny is the state. And this is why we always, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2595.52s)]
*  you know, good conservatives always support the most restrained government you possibly can get. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2601.28s)]
*  If the government is totally restrained, then make sure you restrain it some more [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2606.24s)]
*  because it is the instrument of tyranny and all of this. And then there's the, but then his, but [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2610.08s)]
*  is, but other government, see, we got this Soviet union. And since there's the Soviet union, I mean, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2616.4s)]
*  I understand what you libertarians are talking about, but here you have the biggest experiment [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2624.24s)]
*  in totalitarian government, the government running everything and they're hell bent on [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2629.2799999999997s)]
*  world domination. And so listen, as much as it sucks, the only thing that can stand up to this [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2634.72s)]
*  threat is a government military. And so even though we really don't want to do any of this, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2643.04s)]
*  we have to build up a huge military to roll back the threat of statism. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2649.44s)]
*  And he even says in the article, which is why we got this from, from Googling totalitarian [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2656.6400000000003s)]
*  bureaucracy, because that's the, the, the line that he has, let me see if I could find it here. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2663.2000000000003s)]
*  But he says, he literally says that we need to create a totalitarian bureaucracy within our own [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2671.1200000000003s)]
*  shores. Now, again, if you could get past how retarded that argument is, it's literally like, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2678.32s)]
*  it's like saying that there's a guy outside with a gun threatening to shoot me in the face. And so I [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2687.6800000000003s)]
*  have to shoot myself in the face with my own gun. Like if you're creating a totalitarian bureaucracy [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2694.1600000000003s)]
*  in order to prevent a totalitarian bureaucracy from taking you over, then you you've already lost [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2700.7200000000003s)]
*  by definition, right? So anyway, the argument made no sense. Bill Buckley is a very smart guy. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2707.44s)]
*  He was not that stupid. He was just working for the CIA and his job was to convince conservatives [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2712.2400000000002s)]
*  to support big military. So anyway, but, but so from this is just my point to you about, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2717.84s)]
*  I'm getting to my point about the NATO propaganda, but so, so essentially, just so people understand [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2727.76s)]
*  the Cold War propaganda was that we're only doing this because of the Soviet Union. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2733.92s)]
*  We would not be, we're with you libertarians. We want to just love liberty and prosperity and be a [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2742.2400000000002s)]
*  peaceful, normal country, but there's this Soviet Union. So we have to do all of this. And then [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2747.36s)]
*  in 1989, the Berlin wall comes down. Germany is there's reunification in Germany. The Cold War ends. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2752.6400000000003s)]
*  And so then all of those neo conservatives were like, okay, no more military industrial complex, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2762.96s)]
*  no more going around the world searching for monsters to destroy. Now we can once again, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2770.16s)]
*  embrace liberty and small go. Oh no, that's right. They were like, Hey, we got to go see about Saddam [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2774.64s)]
*  Hussein. He's in a slant drilling conflict with his neighbor Kuwait. You know, we had to go [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2780.16s)]
*  protect the democracy of Kuwait. So we had, and this is when they ramped up the first war [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2788.88s)]
*  under George H.W. Bush, the first war in Iraq, the first, the first war American war of my [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2795.52s)]
*  lifetime. I was a little kid. I was like seven or eight or something like that. What was it? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2800.7200000000003s)]
*  It was in 91. I was born in 83. So I was eight. I do, I remember George H.W. Bush announcing that [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2804.1600000000003s)]
*  we were invading on TV, but it interrupted like the Simpsons or whatever. It's like, come on, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2810.2400000000002s)]
*  let me get back to the Simpsons. Anyway, my point is if you likewise, if you had listened to the [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2815.84s)]
*  propaganda, the official propaganda for 40 years during the cold war, they would have told you [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2821.76s)]
*  that if the Soviet union went away, NATO was, would also disband the official propaganda. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2830.0s)]
*  There was no, there was never any justification for why we would have NATO. If there wasn't a [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2837.1200000000003s)]
*  Soviet union, the whole point of NATO was to be an anti-Soviet military alliance. And essentially [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2841.52s)]
*  what happened, right, was that after world war II, all of Europe was destroyed and the big victors [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2849.36s)]
*  who came out of it was America and Russia and the Soviet union at the time. And now, okay, you could [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2856.24s)]
*  say England also won the war, but England was fucking wrecked. The Soviet satellites were all [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2863.44s)]
*  destroyed. Russia itself had taken heavy fighting. America was kind of the only country who fought in [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2872.0s)]
*  world war II, but did all the fighting abroad. The fighting wasn't here. I mean, with Pearl Harbor, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2879.04s)]
*  you know, out there, which really still isn't mainland, the United States of America, but aside [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2884.88s)]
*  from the attack on Pearl Harbor, there were no attacks here. And so the thinking was, I'm not [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2889.36s)]
*  even saying this is justified, but the thinking was, okay, Europe is destroyed. The Soviet union [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2894.56s)]
*  is this big superpower right here next to Europe. And so we have to like, okay, we'll accept that [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2900.32s)]
*  they get the Eastern half of Europe, but we're going to guarantee for the Western half that if [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2908.1600000000003s)]
*  you guys move on this side, you're picking a fight with America. Okay. Well, that's all over. After [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2912.8s)]
*  1991, the Soviet union doesn't exist anymore. And all those Eastern European countries got their [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2918.4s)]
*  independence. What's the justification for NATO now? If you ask anyone, and I've asked several people, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2923.6800000000003s)]
*  you just get a bunch of googly gock. Like it'll just be like the global community and working [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2931.04s)]
*  together and ensuring peace, keeping the peace and promoting, you know, whatever. It's like they have [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2936.96s)]
*  nothing. There is no reason for us to be a part of NATO whatsoever that we're not under post-World [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2943.7599999999998s)]
*  War II conditions. Europe has not been destroyed by a war and they're poor and we're the only rich [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2949.7599999999998s)]
*  country. Europe is rich. There's a bunch of rich countries in Europe. They can pay for their own [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2955.2799999999997s)]
*  defense. Vladimir Putin, as of right now, the latest estimate I saw is that Russia has about a [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2960.48s)]
*  $2 trillion GDP. Understand that's how big and scary Russia is. Their entire GDP is less than a third [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2967.12s)]
*  of what our government spends every year. Forget our entire economy. There is no reason why Europe [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2975.92s)]
*  can't just have their own security plans that don't involve us. And by the way, we're $36 trillion in [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2982.48s)]
*  debt. We can't really afford to pick up everybody's security anymore. And the idea that we're going to [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2988.4s)]
*  not only pick up their security, but the security of the most further, like we're not even talking [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=2995.52s)]
*  about the original NATO plan. This is never guaranteeing security for Poland, let alone Ukraine. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3001.04s)]
*  They were talking about we didn't even guarantee security for East Germany. It was from the Elbe [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3008.08s)]
*  River West was what we guaranteed when the Soviet Union existed. And you're telling me now when there [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3013.7599999999998s)]
*  is no communism, there is no Soviet threat that we got to guarantee security for the Donbass region? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3020.16s)]
*  This is just like, it's so insane. There is never, there is no one who has ever put forward [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3028.64s)]
*  a coherent defense for that position because it's just pure madness. All right, guys, let's take a [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3036.3199999999997s)]

*  I'll say something real crazy. First is I feel that both Europe and the American left and by [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3152.0800000000004s)]
*  that I mean the senators and politicians and some of the vocal voices, the deep state such as [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3158.5600000000004s)]
*  a mustache man and Brennan who are all on the news seem to be working against the American [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3164.2400000000002s)]
*  interest and trying to keep this Ukraine war going. And here's my tin foil hat theory is that [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3170.2400000000002s)]
*  I think listen, there's been a big charade of endless money that's available for everyone all [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3178.08s)]
*  the time, courtesy of the Fed that gives us a signal into the system of wealth that doesn't [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3183.44s)]
*  actually exist. And I wonder if we actually have a splintering where we go, hey, we're not doing this [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3188.56s)]
*  NATO thing anymore. And then all of a sudden Europe goes broke because they're responsible [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3194.56s)]
*  for their own security. And you end up with some big worldwide financial depression because the [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3198.7999999999997s)]
*  signal of endless money, which that bill will come due at some point, there's going to be [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3203.84s)]
*  austerity nationwide. I mean, worldwide, because that money just the you don't you can't endlessly [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3208.6400000000003s)]
*  print money. I wonder if that if that's kind of what I don't usually use this term, but almost [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3213.36s)]
*  the globalists are contending with is that America is going, hey, we don't want to spend money [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3218.2400000000002s)]
*  everywhere for everyone all the time. We're running up too much debt. This isn't going to work long [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3223.6000000000004s)]
*  term. And one of the easy things to kind of get out of might be security guarantees for the entire [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3228.24s)]
*  world, because that doesn't make a lot of sense, particularly when the rest of the world is talking [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3234.0s)]
*  us into fights that we don't want to be in. In this case, it's Zelensky trying to get American [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3238.8799999999997s)]
*  support to continue the Ukraine war. And then Europe stepping in, really contending with what [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3242.9599999999996s)]
*  looks like our budget because they got us back in them through NATO. So I guess they can go pick the [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3247.8399999999997s)]
*  fight, which just keeps us in the fight, which is why we need to walk away. But it would seem to me [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3252.3199999999997s)]
*  like the biggest risk on the table there might be Europe not actually being able to fund it and then [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3256.48s)]
*  signaling the issues that have kind of been in the financial sector forever. Yeah, well, it is. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3261.44s)]
*  There's an interesting kind of way to look at it. And there's no, you know, I mean, I guess I would [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3270.72s)]
*  disagree that it's like it's not that austerity is guaranteed in the future, but it's there's [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3275.28s)]
*  limited choices. So it's I think there's essentially three. There is austerity. That is the moderate [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3282.64s)]
*  position. Then there are there is default and hyperinflation. Those are your other options. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3292.48s)]
*  But default would probably have to come with austerity measures after it. I don't think you [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3300.72s)]
*  because I don't think technically it's not. I think technically that wouldn't be austerity. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3306.0s)]
*  But I get your point. It would in effect be the same thing. So you in effect have to have [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3311.44s)]
*  drastic cuts in spending. I just mean that it's like you wouldn't necessarily you wouldn't have to [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3315.84s)]
*  like, you know, it wouldn't be a situation of like we owe this debt and therefore we have to cut down [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3320.88s)]
*  on these programs to pay off this debt. It would more just be like, oh, we don't have any debt [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3328.64s)]
*  anymore because we just defaulted on all of that debt. And oh, we can't borrow money at the same [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3333.2000000000003s)]
*  rate anymore because no one's going to lend us money after we just defaulted on the debt. And so [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3337.36s)]
*  yeah, there's no money for these programs. It's in effect. Basically, I think the same thing. But I [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3341.28s)]
*  did want to read this before we wrap up today. And then I guess, you know, we could even save some of [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3346.88s)]
*  the media reaction to all of this for next time, because I don't think we're really going to have [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3350.6400000000003s)]
*  time to enjoy it as much as it deserves to be enjoyed. But Tucker Carlson posted this. And I [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3354.96s)]
*  found this to be very interesting. And to be clear, you know, there's all of the stuff that I [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3363.44s)]
*  kind of specialize in when it comes to like, uh, foreign policy stuff. Um, it's never, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3370.64s)]
*  and even someone like, say, Scott Horton, who he does have, and I guess this, this just comes [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3379.28s)]
*  from being in the game for a long time. I mean, I know I've gotten like a little bit of this now [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3384.64s)]
*  from being in this world for a while where you actually do have like some insiders, you know, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3389.12s)]
*  you have people who are like, like close to the president, who you'll have a phone call with and [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3394.72s)]
*  they'll be like, Hey, this just happened or this just happened. And you start getting like some [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3399.2799999999997s)]
*  more. But none of what I ever, if you look at any of my clips on Rogan or on Tucker or any of that, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3402.48s)]
*  that's never what I'm saying. I'm never going like, look, I know people at the Pentagon and [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3408.7999999999997s)]
*  they're telling me this. I know someone who's there. That's no, I'm always just talking about [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3413.8399999999997s)]
*  what is just the official record. You know what I mean? Like, it's just like, Oh look, even the New [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3417.92s)]
*  York times and the Washington post admitted this and even the four star general, Wesley Clark [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3422.7200000000003s)]
*  admitted this and even these guys. And then we all know we did this, but they wrote this policy paper [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3427.12s)]
*  that said, this is really the reason they're doing it. What Tucker's talking about here is a little [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3431.52s)]
*  bit more of, you know, cause he isn't, he's an insider in a different type of way. The guy lived [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3435.84s)]
*  in Washington, DC for I think 30 years or something like that was, uh, you know, a journalist, a TV [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3440.64s)]
*  host and, uh, you know, ran, uh, um, uh, a new, an online publication is, you know, he was in DC, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3447.04s)]
*  like mixed in with these people. But anyway, so this was, uh, um, the post that I wanted to just [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3453.2799999999997s)]
*  read real quick. This was from Tucker Carlson. Uh, Tucker says one of the most striking things [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3459.84s)]
*  about yesterday's Zelinsky press conference was Lindsey Graham's reaction to it. The two are old [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3465.52s)]
*  friends, but Graham disavowed him within the hour. This was more than just transactional disloyalty. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3470.72s)]
*  It was scapegoating. Lindsey Graham knows what's coming over the past three years with the tacit [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3476.64s)]
*  support of its Western patrons, um, patrons, the Ukrainian government has committed a remarkable [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3481.7599999999998s)]
*  number of serious crimes. The Ukrainians sold huge quantities of American weapons on the [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3488.24s)]
*  international black market at 20 cents on the dollar. These weapons are now in the hands of [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3493.92s)]
*  armed groups around the world, including Hamas, the Mexican drug cartels and the forces now [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3499.44s)]
*  controlling Syria. God knows what the Ukrainians have done with the pathogens in American bio labs [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3505.68s)]
*  in their country. Even us Intel, even us Intel agencies aren't sure. The Ukrainians have also [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3512.0s)]
*  murdered a number of people in various countries and political assassinations and tried to murder [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3518.56s)]
*  others, including American journalists and a European head of state. This is all true [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3523.8399999999997s)]
*  and it's all going to come out at some point. Better to start blaming it on Zelinsky now. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3530.08s)]
*  So that's what Tucker is saying. And I will say that I, I know Tucker well enough, um, that like, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3536.64s)]
*  I'll say with like a hundred percent certainty that Tucker isn't just saying this. Now I'm not, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3546.72s)]
*  I'm not saying with a hundred percent certainty that he's right about every claim in there. I [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3553.2s)]
*  just don't know. Um, but I do know, like I know him and I know that he's not just saying he's [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3556.72s)]
*  saying this because this is what he's hearing from people who are in the know. Um, and that [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3563.44s)]
*  is just a whole nother very interesting wrinkle into all of this, that it is quite possible because [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3568.48s)]
*  it was a little bit strange to hearing Lindsay Lindsey Graham throws a Linsky under the bus [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3576.32s)]
*  right away. Now you could argue that this is just that Lindsey Graham's like, look, I want to keep [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3582.32s)]
*  this war going. And now that this guy pissed off Donald Trump so far, he cannot be the guy to keep [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3588.4s)]
*  the war going. So we need a new guy to come in who flatters Donald Trump and then can keep the war [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3593.12s)]
*  going. But it is also quite possible that like, look, I mean, I'm, I'm sure like you too, Rob, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3597.6s)]
*  like I've heard the rumors about a lot of this stuff. I don't know exactly how true some of it [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3604.0s)]
*  is or, or any of it, but it is interesting that, I mean, look, when you just know the nature of [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3609.04s)]
*  governments and then particularly, you know, the nature of wartime governments, and then you know, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3614.96s)]
*  the amount of money that's being flooded over there, there are, I say there's almost no question [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3619.12s)]
*  that there are serious crimes and huge scandals that have been committed that just haven't come [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3627.52s)]
*  out yet. And that is another interesting wrinkle into all of this to see like what we might learn [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3633.6s)]
*  now. And now that Trump has given, you know, the majority of Americans who support Donald Trump, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3639.8399999999997s)]
*  kind of given them license to be like, no, fuck this guy. Now it might be open season [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3647.6s)]
*  on revealing some of this stuff and then being able to blame it on Zelensky, even though there's [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3654.7999999999997s)]
*  probably a lot more people who are guilty than just Voldemir. All right. Any, any other thoughts, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3660.0s)]
*  Rob, or you want to call it a show? Look forward to the next one and we can look at the, all the [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3668.08s)]
*  senators, the liberal senators getting on the news shows to go. Donald Trump, we told you he's a [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3673.04s)]
*  Putin asset and that's why he turned on Zelensky. And this is an embarrassment for the American [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3678.16s)]
*  people. So, Oh my God, that would be the card. And who knew that they would actually pick it up and [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3682.72s)]
*  play it. Yep. Bernie Sanders. Oh my God. It's so painful. All right. We'll get into all of that [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3688.24s)]
*  on a, on tomorrow's episode. Check out the run your mouth podcast. Rob's other fantastic show, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWm13zNWSc&t=3695.2799999999997s)]
