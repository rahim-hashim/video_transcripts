**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM)
*  What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. I am Dave Smith. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=0.0s)]
*  He is Robbie the Fire Bernstein coming to us from Parts Unknown. How you doing, Rob? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm somewhat enjoying being on the road and somewhat ready to go home, but we're [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=20.04s)]
*  porching, baby. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=23.76s)]
*  Very good. Very good. I've heard great things. I've seen on social media great things about [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=25.76s)]
*  the shows and stuff, so that's good. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=29.96s)]
*  The shows have been killer. It's some of the sleeping on couches and cot beds and this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=31.96s)]
*  and the that's that we'll get to you. But I'm enjoying being out here in Portion, Las [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Vegas on Sunday. That's at the Wise Guys Comedy Club, Salt Lake City all weekend. I'll have [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=40.72s)]
*  my nice own hotel room to shit in. So I'm looking forward to that. And then Reno, Reno [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=44.88s)]
*  this Thursday, followed by Montreal, Catskills, New York, Rochester and something else next [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  weekend. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=55.64s)]
*  Very good. Very good. You know, I've I was thinking about doing yesterday I ended up [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=58.0s)]
*  having a we missed the episode yesterday. I will try my best to make that up. But I [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  you know, I've been like a few things on my mind about libertarianism and the Libertarian [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=68.56s)]
*  Party. And I was thinking about maybe just doing an episode on that. But it's funny. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=75.12s)]
*  Anyway, I got into it. I got into a little bit on Twitter arguing with with Chase Oliver [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=79.16s)]
*  and then arguing with the guy, Steven, who's the current LNC chairman. And I've just been [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=85.84s)]
*  thinking a lot about like, you know, the viability of the Libertarian Party, libertarianism in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=90.84s)]
*  general, just kind of some of my thoughts on this. I thought maybe I would do an episode [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  on that's just funny, as you mentioned, right before we started that you're on your way [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=99.76s)]
*  to Reno next. I was like, Oh, yeah, I have not been to Reno since 2022. For the Libertarian [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=103.2s)]
*  Party National Convention. I don't know why it just seems to be like a lot of things like [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=109.16s)]
*  reminding me of this this topic lately. But it is a yeah, it was a fun convention. Reno, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  not a lot going on. Not a lot going on in that town. Although I still get emails from [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  the hotel that I stayed at when I was out there constantly. You know, when you give [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  someone your email address, and then you're like, you're going to be a part of my life [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=132.6s)]
*  for a while now. But they're trying hard to get me to come back to Reno. They got some [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=135.72s)]
*  great deals on hotels. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=139.68s)]
*  I wish I wish I could recreate that week in Reno because for $50 a night, I got like the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=141.44s)]
*  hotel suite at one of those casinos. It's just empty midweek. There was a tub in the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=147.1s)]
*  room. There was a couch in the room. There was this mountainous views. And I thought [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=152.04s)]
*  at the time I'd be like, man, I'm gonna go live in Reno. But I've never seen that deal [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=156.72s)]
*  again. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=160.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Well, it is always the it's the casinos will really be generous with their [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=161.84s)]
*  deals. Sometimes I remember you said when I was like a kid, I say kid, I mean, like [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=167.08s)]
*  my early 20s. I remember we used to get like, you know, deals for AC and go out there [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=170.76s)]
*  and like gamble. But you'd stay in like a suite that was like built for a king for [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  like $14 a night or something that you know, it's because they know you're going to lose [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=183.2s)]
*  every other cent that you came in there with, which we did very consistently. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=188.12s)]
*  We had the same thing in college. And then I'll quit kibitzing around so we can break [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=192.48s)]
*  down the world events. But my friend at the craps table started just pestering the guy [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=196.44s)]
*  like the the floor manager or whatever for comp breakfast, which was a great comp [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=202.32s)]
*  breakfast. He was just being a real Jew and giving the guy a hard time for some freebies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=206.16s)]
*  And somehow we just accidentally ended up on some premium list and we would get free [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=210.24s)]
*  rooms at the burghada all the time when we were just broke in college. So we would go [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  down there and not even gamble and just stay in nice hotel rooms and feel like kings and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=218.36s)]
*  not do anything. Just drive down and sleep in a bed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=223.32s)]
*  It's pretty great. Pretty great. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=226.56s)]
*  Can. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=228.4s)]
*  Can argue with freebies. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=232.24s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. OK, guys. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=233.88s)]
*  So, by the way, we are the the new site is up and launched. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=235.8s)]
*  Part of the problem dot com has been revamped and it should be like a better experience [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=240.76s)]
*  and everything like that. So thank you very much to all of the people who have [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=245.28s)]
*  who have signed up already. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=249.8s)]
*  And I will try my best to get to some of the questions here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=251.68s)]
*  I was able to get that up here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=254.24s)]
*  OK, so where do we start with? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=257.16s)]
*  You know, I was thinking there was a a clip on [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=260.2s)]
*  Bill Maher show that or I guess this is his his podcast that I thought was [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=265.16s)]
*  was very interesting. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=271.32s)]
*  And I you know, it kind of goes I've been thinking a lot about over the last few days, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=273.32s)]
*  as I'm sure many people have about the the rioting in L.A. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=279.72s)]
*  and and kind of the political ramifications from all of this and where this is going to go. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=285.88000000000005s)]
*  I you know, we got into a little bit on our last episode, what kind of we suspect might happen. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=292.24s)]
*  But anyway, it's just it's it's been interesting to watch. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  The kind of people like Bill Maher, who are, you know, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=303.72s)]
*  liberal, progressive types, but center left in Bill Maher's case, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=309.44000000000005s)]
*  who have certainly been aware of, let's call them the excesses of of of the left [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=315.04s)]
*  from at least that would be their perspective over the last few years. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=322.04s)]
*  And it's been very interesting, like more broadly to watch people try to figure out [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=325.72s)]
*  how are we going to deal with Donald Trump? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=332.8s)]
*  How are we going to like, you know, criticize him going forward? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=334.72s)]
*  How can we effectively oppose Donald Trump? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=338.2s)]
*  All of these are like kind of questions that are baked into the cake of what's been going on [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  for the last, you know, a few months in America. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=346.0s)]
*  And so anyway, I wanted to talk about this because I thought this was there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=349.6s)]
*  There does seem to be. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  And I'm sure you've noticed this, Rob. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=357.36s)]
*  It seems like there was a playbook that was kind of developed around 2016 [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=358.96s)]
*  of how to deal with Donald Trump. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=364.24s)]
*  And every single play in that book has failed. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=366.52s)]
*  Just like objectively, like it failed to stop him from winning the presidency. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=372.0s)]
*  The first time it failed to impeach him, it failed to put him in jail. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=375.4s)]
*  It failed to assassinate him and it failed to stop him from winning the presidency once again. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=378.68s)]
*  So now the question is like, what do we do going forward? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=383.12s)]
*  And it seems like it's almost like they keep looking back into this bag of tricks. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=385.72s)]
*  And they're like, well, maybe if we move things around a little bit [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=390.24s)]
*  and then I pull out this same old trick and you're like, that one already didn't work. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=393.04s)]
*  I just see a lot of this going on anyway. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=397.32s)]
*  Let's let's hear from Bill Maher. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=400.08s)]
*  And then I thought we could discuss this. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=401.64s)]
*  But here is Bill Maher kind of explaining what keeps him not a Republican. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=403.08s)]
*  Let's let's play that clip. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  Because I recognize the craziness on the other side, too, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=410.36s)]
*  and I call them out on their shit just as much. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=413.12s)]
*  It's just that if I had to balance the two, the left shit, yes, is still less [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=415.76s)]
*  fundamentally existentially threatening. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=422.08s)]
*  And it actually affects way less. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=425.16s)]
*  Just got to like the woke shit got too far. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=426.8s)]
*  And it is bad. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=429.36s)]
*  And it has affected lots of people, just not as much as if we never really got to the point. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=431.0s)]
*  And a lot of the other stuff. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=437.12s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=438.16s)]
*  Like I just said, there'll be no more. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=439.68s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  There's no more elections when a Democrat loses like Kamala, like Hillary, they go away. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=441.88s)]
*  They understand there's a winner and a loser in elections. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=447.64s)]
*  You think of Trump lost this last one? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=452.04s)]
*  He would have just accepted it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=454.64s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=456.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=457.24s)]
*  I don't think that's a right issue. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=458.08s)]
*  I think that's just a Trump issue. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=459.68s)]
*  I don't think that's a right issue. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=461.32s)]
*  I think that's just a Trump issue. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=462.8s)]
*  I think that's just a Trump issue. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=464.24s)]
*  Like if JD Vance loses, if he runs next year, he'll probably shake hands and move on like a gentleman. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=465.24s)]
*  But it's Trump. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=471.0s)]
*  That's what you get. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=471.72s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=473.16s)]
*  But Trump is the right now. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=476.68s)]
*  So I think that's just a Trump issue. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=477.2s)]
*  That's just what you get. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=479.6s)]
*  That's a very sanguine way to look at it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's possible. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=483.92s)]
*  I'm not going to say that's not possible, but expecting a very rosy future based on that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=486.0s)]
*  That may not be. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=494.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=495.0s)]
*  Now, obviously, there's, you know, I just find that clip to be fascinating. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=496.0s)]
*  Rob, I can already see you get why I wanted to discuss this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=501.0s)]
*  Because, look, it's just it's very little. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=504.6s)]
*  He didn't say that much there. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=507.04s)]
*  But there's so much that's baked into this worldview. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=508.28s)]
*  And I'll tell you that that reminds me, you know, I can't even this was so many years ago. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=512.24s)]
*  It might have even been before you were on the podcast. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=518.92s)]
*  Rob. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=521.52s)]
*  But there was this one time where, you know, I think it was around when Rand Paul was first [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=522.52s)]
*  in the Senate. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=530.12s)]
*  But, you know, so it was the beginning of my podcasting. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=531.12s)]
*  But maybe this was like 2012, 2013 or something like that. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  And Rand Paul had been talking about he had been making an attempt to try to get some [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=538.0s)]
*  black voters in, you know, like he was trying to appeal to the African-American vote leading [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=546.4s)]
*  into his 2016 presidential campaign, which he had, you know, he had pretty much planned [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=553.0s)]
*  on running for president, I think, from after his father lost in 2012. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=557.3199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, he was talking about like, you know, economic free zones in, you know, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  hard hit inner cities. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=568.6s)]
*  And he was talking about, you know, getting rid of mandatory voting. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  And he was talking about, you know, getting rid of mandatory minimums for first offenders and drug [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  crimes and stuff like this. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=579.84s)]
*  And Joy Reed did a segment at she was at MSNBC. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=581.52s)]
*  She was new at MSNBC at the time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  And she did a segment where she was talking about how Rand Paul had he had voted for or he had [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=589.36s)]
*  voiced support for voter ID laws. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  And Joy Reed goes, Well, you know, you could talk about all this stuff about how you care about [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=602.88s)]
*  the rights of black people. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=607.12s)]
*  But if you don't care about our most central fundamental right, which is the right to vote, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=608.7199999999999s)]
*  then you're never going to win black people. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  And I remember doing this response to it at the time. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=615.52s)]
*  I had no audience at a tiny little show. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=619.1999999999999s)]
*  But I remember doing this response to it where I was just like, think about how crazy it is to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=621.5999999999999s)]
*  think that voting is the most central, most important right. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=627.4000000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, don't get me wrong, voting is OK. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=633.8000000000001s)]
*  First of all, it's not like a natural right. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=637.32s)]
*  It's a constructed right of some sense. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=639.24s)]
*  But it like really like think about that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=643.1600000000001s)]
*  Like voting is something that most people don't do. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=646.84s)]
*  Like it's certainly true in non presidential years. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=653.1600000000001s)]
*  The majority of the voting age public does not vote and look like non presidential elections. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=657.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm not it might be close to like 50 percent who vote in presidential elections. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=664.12s)]
*  But like a huge portion of people just don't even exercise this vote. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=668.5200000000001s)]
*  And to be completely honest, look like feel however you feel about representative government. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=671.6400000000001s)]
*  If there's to be a government, perhaps there's an argument that people should get a say in that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  government or whatever. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=681.48s)]
*  But like really, if I were to take away like your freedom of speech or your ability to vote [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=683.0s)]
*  every few years, is that is there even a contest if I were to take away your freedom to trade or [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=689.96s)]
*  to work or to travel or like any of these things? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=696.6800000000001s)]
*  Are you telling me that? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=699.88s)]
*  Anyway, it's just there is something in the liberal mind that makes like elections and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  voting like the most important thing. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=707.96s)]
*  And so that's kind of goofy that that gets exposed here. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=711.88s)]
*  But then you'll also see that Bill Maher, it's like this fantasy land where, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=714.76s)]
*  okay, he can recognize he's got to be able to recognize. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=719.64s)]
*  And he talks about it quite often how bat shit crazy the Democrats are. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=723.24s)]
*  But then he's got to find one thing that no pun intended trumps all of that, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=728.12s)]
*  you know, to like justify still being on that side. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=733.08s)]
*  And so it's election denying. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=736.36s)]
*  We're never going to have elections again. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=738.84s)]
*  If Donald Trump hadn't won this last time, he wouldn't have conceded the election. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=741.08s)]
*  You're like, and then what? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=745.24s)]
*  Like, why? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=748.12s)]
*  Why is this important? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=749.08s)]
*  Look, even if you want to say it's not healthy for our society, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=751.48s)]
*  it's not conducive to like harmony for the candidate to not accept the results of the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=755.48s)]
*  election or something like that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=760.6s)]
*  Like, fine. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=761.8000000000001s)]
*  But Donald Trump refused to concede the election in 2020 when he was in power. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=762.84s)]
*  But yet we still had the election and he still got on a plane and went back to Mar-a-Lago [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=771.88s)]
*  and sat and bitched and moaned for four years as Joe Biden was president. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=776.76s)]
*  So what would have happened if Kamala Harris had won and Trump doesn't accept? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=780.44s)]
*  Okay, Kamala Harris still would have been president. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=785.48s)]
*  And does anybody, including Bill Mark, does anybody genuinely believe that we are not [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=788.44s)]
*  going to have a presidential election in 2028? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=794.6800000000001s)]
*  And why would you believe that? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=799.0s)]
*  And why would you believe that somehow Donald Trump, what, he's just going to hang on to power? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=801.48s)]
*  Like, there's just the idea is so ridiculous. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=807.48s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't in order to pull off what they're describing here, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=810.6800000000001s)]
*  this would be a legit coup. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=816.1999999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump would have to have like the military on his side to keep him in power. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=819.3199999999999s)]
*  That's simply just not going to happen. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=825.88s)]
*  There's no chance of it happening. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=828.28s)]
*  So it's just, again, it's just so ridiculous. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=830.04s)]
*  It's like you have to make up this. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=833.16s)]
*  It feels almost religious for someone like Bill Mark, but you have to make up this kind of like, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=836.6s)]
*  this mythology that this completely not real threat is a very real threat. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=841.4s)]
*  And therefore it undoes any of the potential threats of the other side. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=849.24s)]
*  Any thoughts, Rob? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=854.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=855.3199999999999s)]
*  And on top of all of that, the Democrats are cry babies also. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=855.64s)]
*  There was the incident with Gore Lieberman. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=860.76s)]
*  They certainly contested an election. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=862.6s)]
*  And there was also Hillary Clinton after she lost to Donald Trump. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=864.92s)]
*  She was trying to say that it wasn't legitimate because Trump was a Russian asset or whatever. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=868.92s)]
*  I don't even remember what that was, but she was definitely- [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=873.7199999999999s)]
*  Hillary Clinton actually tried to get the electoral colleges sent back to the states [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=876.12s)]
*  so that they could change their votes. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=885.4s)]
*  She tried all types of stuff after the 2016 election. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=887.0s)]
*  So first, as you pointed out, Donald Trump did leave office when he left the last time. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=890.76s)]
*  There's zero indicators right now that he's going to go full dictator [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=895.64s)]
*  and stick around at the end of this term. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=899.64s)]
*  If he had lost to Kamala, there's no indication that he would have somehow [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=902.52s)]
*  taken over the government and still have been president. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=906.8399999999999s)]
*  And the Democrats are cry babies when they lose as well. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=909.64s)]
*  I call it the racist old lady syndrome, which is if there was a racist old lady [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=913.4s)]
*  and you opened up your door and there were a bunch of people beating her up, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=918.5999999999999s)]
*  you would instantly take the old lady's side because they're like, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=921.56s)]
*  why are these people beating her up? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=923.88s)]
*  But then if they stop beating her up and all of a sudden she starts screaming [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=925.56s)]
*  racist obscenities, you go, oh my God, that's a racist old lady. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=928.36s)]
*  And I think that's the media's problem with Donald Trump is just leave him alone. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=931.72s)]
*  And by the way, he might turn out to be right on some things, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=935.96s)]
*  in which case we'll end up with a better country. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=938.76s)]
*  But if you guys just scream nonsense at him all the time, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=941.0s)]
*  he's like the racist old lady getting beat up or you have to take his side [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=944.36s)]
*  because you guys are just screaming nonsense. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=948.12s)]
*  There's plenty of stuff to criticize Donald Trump about right now, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=949.72s)]
*  but if your only claim for why you're supporting Democrats over Republicans [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=952.84s)]
*  is because you think that there's a risk of Donald Trump being a dictator [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=956.76s)]
*  and not leaving office, then you don't have any criticism of Donald Trump. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=960.2800000000001s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=964.12s)]

*  You can continue using Gmail for garbage, but use Proton Mail for the important stuff. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=989.3199999999999s)]
*  Proton will always have a freemium version and you can later upgrade to a paid product [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=993.88s)]

*  Go check them out. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1003.56s)]
*  Proton Mail. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1004.5999999999999s)]
*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1006.1199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's right. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1008.44s)]
*  That's right, because you have to invent something. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1009.48s)]
*  And like, look, there are things to be alarmed about and concerned about. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1011.64s)]
*  Like, I really, and I do not know enough about this. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1018.28s)]
*  Maybe this is the next thing I got to do a deep dive into. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1021.48s)]
*  But like, the Palantir stuff is very concerning to me. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1024.04s)]
*  Like, this is like very bizarre. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1028.3600000000001s)]
*  And I saw JD Vance's defense of it was like just totally unpersuasive to me. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1029.96s)]
*  His defense of it was basically like, ah, the government has all this information already. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1037.48s)]
*  So like, if we give it to Palantir or not, you know, they still have all of it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1041.32s)]
*  It's like, okay, so get rid of it. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1045.24s)]
*  Stop having it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1048.44s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1049.88s)]
*  It was a problem that the government decided to collect all of our information [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1051.08s)]
*  and abolish privacy. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1054.76s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1056.44s)]
*  The solution is not giving it to Peter Thiel. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1057.4s)]
*  That's not the solution to that problem. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1059.8s)]
*  The problem would be to get rid of it and abolish those government agencies that we're holding it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1062.04s)]
*  Criminally hold the people responsible who created these programs to begin with. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1068.04s)]
*  The answer isn't to like give. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1072.1999999999998s)]
*  Even I've seen people making calls for Palantir to be collecting data [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1074.6s)]
*  so that we can deport illegal immigrants or something like that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1081.56s)]
*  It's like, listen, dude, this is a dangerous game to go down. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1086.04s)]
*  And like, I do not, you know, I'm certainly, especially after seeing just in the 21st century, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1089.3999999999999s)]
*  seeing all the immediate post 9-11 justifications for why we need this war on terrorism [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1096.2s)]
*  and then watching them try to turn that domestically on the American people and go, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1102.3600000000001s)]
*  oh, there are domestic, the language of domestic terrorists got, was used to describe [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1107.0800000000002s)]
*  moms and dads at school board meetings who were against their kids being [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1115.64s)]
*  propagandized with like gender insanity. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1121.16s)]
*  It was used for people who not didn't even enter the Capitol building, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1123.96s)]
*  but maybe just protested the 2020 election. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1128.6000000000001s)]
*  So like, I certainly am very keenly aware of these kind of government programs being [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1131.4s)]
*  justified, their creation being justified by, oh, we're only going after this one group of people. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1142.28s)]
*  And then it being used to really broaden that net and go after many other people. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1148.44s)]
*  So it's like, no, it's not that there aren't any legitimate concerns or criticisms, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1152.28s)]
*  but when you start, you know, like Gavin Newsom had some address the other day [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1157.16s)]
*  where he's like, oh, this is it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1161.0s)]
*  This is the moment the war on democracy has been declared. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1163.24s)]
*  And you're like, wait, the war on democracy. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1167.16s)]
*  So now the right of people to riot in the streets, that's what you mean by democracy? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1169.72s)]
*  Is Trump a threat to that? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1176.84s)]
*  Because how the hell are you possibly going to like drum up public support over that? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1178.76s)]
*  But the idea that elections are over now is just, I mean, look, this was a group who settled on [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1185.4s)]
*  we're going to go with Donald Trump was recruited by Putin in the 80s or something like that. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1193.88s)]
*  So I guess maybe far-fetched doesn't really register with them, but that it is so far-fetched [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1199.72s)]
*  and so removed from reality that it's just I don't even know what to say about it. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1205.96s)]
*  Like this is what you're going with. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1211.8s)]
*  It would almost be like it'd be like on the level of if the official, not just like what [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1213.16s)]
*  some people were saying, but like the official like opposition to Barack Obama was that he's [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1222.28s)]
*  going to institute Sharia law in America. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1229.08s)]
*  You know what? I'm not saying there weren't like some fringe voices who said that on the right, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1231.88s)]
*  but like if that were really if that if that was what Mitt Romney or or Donald Trump was [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1236.5200000000002s)]
*  standing up and running on, oh, this guy's about to institute Sharia law, I think as many liberals [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1242.7600000000002s)]
*  would just roll their eyes at that and go like, this is just not based in reality at all. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1249.24s)]
*  That's it's literally to me has as much merit as your criticism of Donald Trump being that [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1254.92s)]
*  regular elections will no longer be held in the United States of America. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1261.24s)]
*  And do you really think Barack Obama is going to start wearing a burka as he's the wife in [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1264.76s)]
*  that relationship? I don't think so. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1268.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was always it was always so opposite. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1270.2s)]
*  The guy is clearly not a fundamentalist Muslim. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1272.52s)]
*  It's clearly very socially progressive, but you know, but yeah, you know, it was like, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1275.64s)]
*  like it was there was always that stuff where it was and people used to make fun of it, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1282.2s)]
*  but like he was supposed to be the first Muslim president who was like instituting gay marriage [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1286.1200000000001s)]
*  and stuff like that. It was like, yeah, there's you really got to pick which one of these you [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1290.76s)]
*  think is the real story here. Anyway, obviously, the the the chaos in Los Angeles is still going [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1294.36s)]
*  on. Have you been watching? Have you seen any of the images out of there, Rob? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1304.68s)]
*  I mean, I've seen some, you know, fun images of burning cars and whatnot. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1308.84s)]
*  I was in San Francisco the other day and thought it was surprisingly pleasant. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1312.04s)]
*  And so I am curious out in L.A. You know, clearly there was violence and rioting and I support [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1317.16s)]
*  Donald Trump's decision. But thus far, you know, I was hoping to see California as more of a war zone. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1322.3600000000001s)]
*  But I'm here at the moment and at least the areas I am are more than relatively peaceful. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1328.44s)]
*  But yeah, there was certainly a violent riot in L.A. in particular areas. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1333.72s)]
*  And Trump Trump was just fighting. Yes, I've seen some cars on fire and some other [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1338.92s)]
*  lunatic images of people holding Mexican flags and whatnot. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1343.08s)]
*  You know, there's something about that which is really I'll tell you, and I've noticed this [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1348.12s)]
*  through just to show that I'm not like, you know, I'm not letting my own issue, you know, like, OK, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1353.8799999999999s)]
*  obviously, like I'm an immigration restrictionist and I've had debates about this subject and been [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1360.76s)]
*  talking about it for years now. But there is something about the way the modern left [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1365.08s)]
*  protests. And this was true during the BLM protests. This was true during the [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1374.76s)]
*  Palestinian, the pro-Palestine protests. It's true during this immigration protest where, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1383.56s)]
*  and this is something, at least it seems to me, like this is something that's really changed over [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1389.8799999999999s)]
*  the last 20 years or so and was not at least it seemed to me it was not the case previously to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1394.52s)]
*  that. I remember I remember going to there was an Iraq war protest or like a George W. Bush protest. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1402.76s)]
*  Forgive me if I've told this story before on the show, but I was maybe so I was born in 1983 [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1414.04s)]
*  and we invaded Iraq in 2003. So I was like 20 years old. And I remember they had one in Union [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1420.36s)]
*  Square. And I was just, you know, I wasn't super political at the time at all. This might have been [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1426.6s)]
*  2004, 2005. It might have been like 21, 22 or something like that. But so I went over to it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1433.08s)]
*  And I remember like talking to one of the guys who was an organizer or volunteer or something there. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1439.4799999999998s)]
*  And they were like the very lefty kind of hippie-ish people. And, you know, I was just [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1444.52s)]
*  asking about it. I was like, oh, so what are you guys protesting? And he was like, he just [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1449.8s)]
*  started explaining it to me. And he was like, look, like this war and he didn't really know all his [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1453.56s)]
*  stuff, but he knew some stuff. And he was like, well, look, the war was was launched based off [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1458.3600000000001s)]
*  lies. The George W. Bush wanted this war because he says they tried to kill his dad. It had nothing [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1463.88s)]
*  to do with 9-11. Like he used 9-11 to launch this illegal aggressive war. And they instituted the [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1470.84s)]
*  Patriot Act. He goes, they don't need a judge's warrant now to spy on you. And he goes, that's [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1477.1599999999999s)]
*  un-American. That's the whole idea of America is that we're a free country. And you know what I [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1483.0s)]
*  mean? You have due process, you have rights, you have all these. And I remember like being like, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1488.04s)]
*  no, that seemed pretty reasonable to me in my whatever not completely developed mind. And now [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1492.12s)]
*  that my mind is completely developed, not up to a normal person's, but more so than it was [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1497.72s)]
*  at the time. You're like, yeah, you know, that still was a somewhat reasonable point. And [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1502.1200000000001s)]
*  the way he was approaching it was like, hey, dude, like this isn't what America is supposed to be. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1508.68s)]
*  We're supposed to be this other thing. And we're kind of and I remember being like, you know, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1514.52s)]
*  just being like, okay, that kind of resonated with me. Something has happened with these [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1518.3600000000001s)]
*  protest movements, post kind of like the rise of wokeism, where these protesters will it's, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1524.04s)]
*  you almost wonder you're like, what is the goal here? Is your goal to turn everybody off? Like, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1534.2s)]
*  I would think the goal of a protest would be to gain support for the issue that you're protesting [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1541.32s)]
*  against, like gain support in opposition to whatever thing you're protesting against, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1547.56s)]
*  because you'd see what these like Black Lives Matter protests, where they'd be like, they'd be [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1553.24s)]
*  like cornering some like white couple at a cafe, and getting in their face and demanding that they [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1558.28s)]
*  chant Black Lives Matter. And you're like, how do you think that's going to play to the viewer? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1565.08s)]
*  And then after a couple months of these protests, you see support for Black Lives Matter just [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1570.52s)]
*  absolutely plummeting. And you're like, wow, shocker, you know, like, turns out, yeah, this is [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1574.28s)]
*  like burning down somebody's city doesn't really make them want to be on board with your cause. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1579.08s)]
*  This was something that of course, I was critical of over the last couple years of during the some [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1583.8799999999999s)]
*  of the pro Palestine, like portrait where they be, you know, preaching for open communism, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1588.6799999999998s)]
*  globalize the anti FATA, you know, celebrating the Hamas terrorists and stuff. And you're like, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1594.76s)]
*  what are you doing here? Like, are you working for the massage? What are you doing? You try to like, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1601.08s)]
*  it's just crazy. And again, you know, you've got in this protest movement, I've seen several images [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1606.36s)]
*  of this, you have what appear to be Mexican Americans holding up Mexican flags, saying, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1613.8s)]
*  this is Mexico. You're just like, you're like, yo, dude, like, what this is what you're taking [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1620.4399999999998s)]
*  an issue that you're already losing on public support is not for you. And you're not you don't [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1627.56s)]
*  have any like thought of like, you know, it reminds me of you ever read Black Lives Matter, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1633.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's still up there. It's been years since I read it. But Black Lives Matter, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1640.36s)]
*  the official organization, they had like a list of demands. And we I swear to God, Rob, if you [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1644.04s)]
*  read through it, like the first three are like kind of reasonable. You know what I mean? Like the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1651.24s)]
*  first three, maybe you wouldn't completely agree with all of them. But like you'd be kind of like, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1656.76s)]
*  these are pretty reasonable asks. It's like, number one is like accountability for killer cops, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1660.44s)]
*  you know? Okay, all right. Yeah, I see where you're going. And number two would be like, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1665.56s)]
*  abolish the cash bail system. And you go, all right, I don't know exactly. I feel about that. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1669.24s)]
*  It is a little bit messed up that you know what I mean? Like if someone's got money, they're, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1673.88s)]
*  they get the presumption of innocence. But if you don't have money, you essentially have the [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1678.04s)]
*  presumption of guilt. All right, there's a fair but you know, it's like, so it'd be like three [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1681.96s)]
*  things like that. And then number four would be like, abolish the nuclear family. And you're like, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1685.3200000000002s)]
*  yeah, you know, you lost me on that one. You know, like that's like, you really that that's a lot to [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1690.52s)]
*  try to sneak that into your movement, you know, and you just see these things where it's like, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1697.0800000000002s)]
*  so you're not going to come out and say, Hey, we're for due process before deportations, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1701.8s)]
*  something that maybe at least has a chance of resonating with a number of people, but you're [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1707.4s)]
*  going to go abolish America. Like that's your starting point. It's like, all right, I don't [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1712.92s)]
*  doesn't seem like the best way to sell your ideas to me. It's just something it's I don't know. It's [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1718.84s)]
*  just it's like they're so divorced from reality, that they just can't even begin to approach [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1724.6s)]
*  something that maybe could catch on. Yeah, it just a small sample of that is the couple videos I saw [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1731.0s)]
*  of people that were busted vandalizing Tesla's there's a left confidence that you think you're [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1738.04s)]
*  so justified and so many people are on board with your cause that when they suddenly get in [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1744.76s)]
*  trouble for it, they can't even believe that anyone was taking issue with what they were doing. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1749.8s)]
*  COVID would be another great example that there were some people who would have been more than [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1754.28s)]
*  comfortable with more rights being taken from those that weren't getting vaccinated because [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1759.0s)]
*  they were so convinced that you were killing grandma and that you were not contributing to [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1763.56s)]
*  society and that you were the reason why COVID was still going and that you were actually a risk to [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1767.64s)]
*  their lives and it was not government overreach that was destroying their lives. It was the few [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1772.28s)]
*  individuals that weren't compliant and not doing their part for society. I wish I wish I had that [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1776.84s)]
*  liberal confidence because it's nice. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1782.44s)]
*  for today's show, which is Crowd Health. Look, nobody likes their health insurance provider [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1787.16s)]
*  because the health insurance market is incredibly broken due to government interference. But now [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1793.56s)]
*  there is a true alternative to health insurance, Crowd Health. Crowd Health is significantly less [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1800.12s)]
*  expensive than health insurance. They rip out the middle man so you don't have to deal with the [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1806.4399999999998s)]
*  costs of bureaucracy. Singles are $185 a month. A family of four is just $605 a month. And now, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1810.36s)]
*  if you use the promo code POTP, you can get $99 a month per person for the next three months. Just [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1819.0s)]
*  go to joincrowdhealth.com and use the promo code POTP for just $99 a month per person for the next [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1826.6s)]
*  three months. Crowd Health is not health insurance. It's a totally different way of paying for health [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1835.24s)]
*  care. Terms and conditions may apply. Once again, joincrowdhealth.com, promo code POTP for $99 a [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1839.9599999999998s)]
*  month per person for the next three months. All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1848.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, really? Well, I guess one of the things that's kind of shocking to me [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1853.16s)]
*  is that I think a lot of that confidence that you're talking about is born out of, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1858.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, like it's born out of an echo chamber. It's born out of an environment where everybody [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1865.32s)]
*  agrees with you and everyone around you agrees with you. And so there's really nothing to [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1871.56s)]
*  indicate that there's going to be a lot of pushback or something like that. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1877.0800000000002s)]
*  And, you know, as Jonathan Haidt has demonstrated, where he's done some really interesting work on [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1882.12s)]
*  this, where he's demonstrated that this is an opinion, this is like just born out, that [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1887.6399999999999s)]
*  leftists have a much tougher time understanding right wingers than right wingers have understanding [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1896.36s)]
*  leftists. So like if you ask a right winger or a conservative to explain what leftists believe, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1905.0s)]
*  they can do it with reasonable accuracy. But if you ask a left winger to explain what right [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1912.12s)]
*  wingers believe, they often completely struggle. Like they cannot steel man the other position. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1916.84s)]
*  They have to just say, they believe in being racist or whatever, you know? But so if you come [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1923.08s)]
*  out when if you come out of an environment, like let's say you went to a liberal arts college, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1928.2s)]
*  and you've had like, let's say your parents are liberal. Every one of your professors are [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1934.2s)]
*  liberal or leftists. All of Hollywood is liberal or leftists, you know, everyone in the media is [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1944.2s)]
*  liberal or leftist. It's kind of like that's all you see. That's all you know. If you were being [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1950.52s)]
*  woke on a college campus in 2017, it was like everyone was with you. The agreement was unanimous. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1955.48s)]
*  And so in that environment, I do understand, you know, at the beginning of COVID, you've got the [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1963.96s)]
*  entire media apparatus, the entire government apparatus, everyone is saying, yes, follow the [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1969.72s)]
*  science, you are correct. They are killing grandma. I guess it's more striking to see it now when [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1974.68s)]
*  Donald Trump has been reelected, wins every swing state, wins the popular vote, his central issue [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1982.1200000000001s)]
*  has always been this immigration fight. And yet you still are not thinking to yourself that like, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1988.12s)]
*  holding up a foreign flag and claiming that this land, which is under the jurisdiction of the United [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=1994.4399999999998s)]
*  States of America, and has been for quite a while, is Mexico, you don't see how this is going to not [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2000.4399999999998s)]
*  be effective messaging. That to me is just more surprising in some ways. But yes, you are right, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2006.6799999999998s)]
*  that confidence has been there throughout all of these protest movements. And it's stunning to me [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2012.36s)]
*  to see it. All right, let's play. Here's Eric Swalwell, of course, Democrat establishment hack, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2020.76s)]
*  and one of the kind of chief anti-Trump members of Congress throughout his first term. Here's his [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2030.36s)]
*  thoughts on this. One of our best resources for understanding the Chinese agenda. That's for sure. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2039.88s)]
*  He's going deep cover to get that job done. Yes, of course, also had an affair with a Chinese spy, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2045.16s)]
*  that which that is true. Here is Eric Swalwell commenting on the Gavin Newsom [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2054.36s)]
*  first Donald Trump showdown. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2059.88s)]
*  And I have the only lawsuit that remains for what he did on January 6. So you have to be on [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2089.88s)]
*  offense. I recognize as a former prosecutor, a son of a cop, a bully, and bullies only respond [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2095.6400000000003s)]
*  to one language, and it's the language of strength. And that's what the governor is bringing to him. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2101.8s)]
*  And that's what we must continue to do to put him back on his heels. You have to make Donald Trump. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2107.0s)]
*  All right. Well, what do you think, Rob? Surefire. You see what I mean about how they can only just [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2113.56s)]
*  go back into their bag of tricks and just shuffle things around and pull one out. I'm the guy who [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2124.36s)]
*  led the impeachment. How'd that impeachment go there, Swalwell? Oh yeah, he was acquitted. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2129.24s)]
*  Here's my list of dishonest failures. Here's all the ways that I tried to bog him down with [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2135.24s)]
*  bullshit and I wasn't actually successful. And once again, this is exactly my racist old lady [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2140.44s)]
*  talking point. When you're the dishonest one, when you come forward and you act aggressively [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2145.96s)]
*  towards Donald Trump in a dishonest way, where you're trying to get in the way of him actually [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2151.48s)]
*  representing the people that voted him in, nobody likes it. That's why he's back in office. It's [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2156.28s)]
*  because of the lawsuits you brought against him. It's because you arrested him. It's because you [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2161.64s)]
*  guys showed up at Mar-a-Lago. It's because there was an assassination attempt. That's why he's [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2165.4s)]
*  back in office. And so firstly, he's such a nobody and nothing, but to say with pride, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2169.96s)]
*  hey, look at all the things I do. Look at all these dirty little weasel tricks I tried to pull [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2175.8s)]
*  on Donald Trump. And sure, none of them worked yet. It's almost, you ever watch Wacky Racers? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2179.88s)]
*  There's that weasel character and the entire, I don't know if you ever watched this. This is [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2184.28s)]
*  a dumb cartoon. It predates us. It's from the Hanna-Barbera era, but there's the, I don't even [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2187.64s)]
*  remember the name, but he's got the big mustache and the whole thing. Instead of engaging in the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2194.52s)]
*  race, he's just trying to pull tricks on everyone else that they lose and he never wins. He's got [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2198.28s)]
*  the dastardly dog laughing. That's who this guy is in the cartoon of US politics of look at the [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2202.0400000000004s)]
*  little weasel tricks I've tried and sure none of them have worked yet, but I'm going to represent [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2207.96s)]
*  the Democrats and continue to be dishonest because that's the only way, hasn't worked yet. And that's [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2212.1200000000003s)]
*  exactly what I'm describing with the beating up a racist old lady. Yeah. Well, that's, yeah, no, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2218.6800000000003s)]
*  that's exactly right. And, you know, it's funny to watch these guys. Now again, look, none of us [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2224.6s)]
*  have a crystal ball and we don't know exactly how all of this is going to play out. And I'll caveat [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2231.3199999999997s)]
*  with like, perhaps Donald Trump does overstep here and it ends up backfiring and hurting him [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2237.88s)]
*  politically. But to frame what's going on in LA as if Gavin Newsom took the fight to Donald Trump, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2243.88s)]
*  it's like, dude, Donald Trump is. He has picked the fight on his terms that he wants, which is [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2251.72s)]
*  what politics really is about. And Donald Trump, I think in this example, has demonstrated mastery [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2263.3999999999996s)]
*  of politics, whether you like it or not. But, you know, a lot of them are saying like, oh, this was [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2271.48s)]
*  just to distract from the thing that was going on with him and Elon Musk or he's doing something, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2276.12s)]
*  it's an overreaction or something. It's like, yeah, all of that's probably true. It doesn't matter. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2282.12s)]
*  It's beside the point. Every politician wants the news cycle to not be on the story that looks bad [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2287.96s)]
*  for them, but be on the story that looks good for them. That's what they're all doing. That's what [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2294.04s)]
*  politics is. And yes, he's effectively done that. Like that's now what the story is. The story is [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2297.8s)]
*  now what's going on in LA. And you could sit here and say that the riots didn't get as out of control [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2303.88s)]
*  as the 2020 riots did. Obviously, that's true. But what is the implication there that we're to sit [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2311.08s)]
*  back and wait until they do? And then and only then are you allowed to respond? Which like, let's get [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2318.2s)]
*  real. They would still have the same reaction if he did wait that long and then responded. The point [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2323.56s)]
*  is that Donald Trump has picked a fight against sanctuary cities and riots. That's the ground that [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2328.92s)]
*  he's on right now. That's the strongest political ground for Donald Trump to be on. Guess what, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2338.68s)]
*  America, if you haven't received the message yet, open borders and riots are not popular. They are [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2344.52s)]
*  not winning issues. Donald Trump has positioned himself to be on the other end of that as the guy [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2353.72s)]
*  who's opposing that. This is a winning issue for Donald Trump. And if you don't believe me, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2359.64s)]
*  then just take it from the most trusted name in news, CNN, of course. But anyway, listen, this I [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2365.48s)]
*  did find interesting. This is CNN from their own horse's mouth. Here's CNN talking about what the [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2372.6000000000004s)]
*  polling looks like on this issue, specifically from immigrants. And this is actually very, very [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2381.0s)]
*  interesting polling. So let's play this clip. Start off on the fact that immigrant citizens, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2387.88s)]
*  immigrant voters, foreign-born voters have gone tremendously to the right on this issue in 2024 [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2394.12s)]
*  and 2025 versus where they were in 2020. Closest to or trust more in immigration. You go back to [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2400.04s)]
*  2020. Democrats get this, held a 32-point lead on this issue. Immigrant voters were in the Democratic [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2404.52s)]
*  camp. Jump forward to 2024, 2025. Look at that shift, a 40-point shift to the right among immigrant [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2410.7599999999998s)]
*  voters. Republicans now lead on this issue by eight points over Democrats, more so than any other [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2418.84s)]
*  group that I could find. The group of voters who became more hawkish on immigration were in fact [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2425.32s)]
*  immigrants themselves, immigrants who are registered to vote in this country. So that's on that issue. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2431.08s)]
*  How about how they feel about kind of traditionally, historically about Donald Trump? Yeah. So, you know, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2436.84s)]
*  you see this shift and you go, what is going on underneath the hood? Well, take a look, Donald [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2442.28s)]
*  Trump, you remember when he first ran back in 2016. Immigrant voters are one of his weakest [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2446.28s)]
*  box, but look at this. Trump's vote share in presidential election among, again, immigrant [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2450.52s)]
*  citizens, those who are registered to vote. Look at this. 2016, he got 36 percent of the vote. You go to 2020, 39 [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2454.28s)]
*  percent of the vote. Look at this in 2024, all the way up to 47 percent of the vote. Some polls I looked [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2459.5600000000004s)]
*  at had him barely losing that vote. Some polls I looked at had him barely winning that vote. Again, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2466.0400000000004s)]
*  there is no block of voters that shifted more to the right from 2020 to 2024 than immigrant voters [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2470.52s)]
*  and Donald Trump, at least in some surveys, actually won that vote. On average, it's about equal. So there [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2478.52s)]
*  may be all this stuff right about undocumented immigrants and Trump being harsh on them, but [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2484.36s)]
*  immigrant voters themselves have increasingly liked Donald Trump and have increasingly moved to the [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2488.7599999999998s)]
*  right on immigration into the Republican camp. Well, then on that, what you're getting at, how [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2493.24s)]
*  how immigrant citizens, voters feel about people in the country illegally. Yeah, and this is where [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2498.52s)]
*  it all kind of comes together, Kate Baldwin. Look at this. The net favorable rating, immigrants who [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2505.88s)]
*  are here illegally among immigrant citizens, again, those registered to vote. In 2020, look at this, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2510.04s)]
*  plus 23 points on the net favorable rating, but look at where we were in 2024, minus six points [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2514.68s)]
*  underwater. So immigrant citizens have become increasingly unfavorable in their views of those [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2520.68s)]
*  immigrants who are here illegally. So I think it's so important when we're talking about this debate [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2526.84s)]
*  from a political angle to separate those out who are undocumented immigrants versus those who are [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2531.08s)]
*  here legally and those who are citizens and those who are voters, because that group of voters has [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2535.96s)]
*  felt increasingly distant from those immigrants who are here legally. And again, when we're talking [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2541.7200000000003s)]
*  about this, at least from a political angle, this is why Donald Trump feels so comfortable, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2546.52s)]
*  because in fact, amongst the group that you would think that would be most opposed to this, in fact, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2550.36s)]
*  they become increasingly favorable, not just towards Donald Trump, but towards a Republican [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2554.44s)]
*  point of view on immigration and becoming distant from those immigrants who are here illegally. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2558.6s)]
*  All right. So look, I am not telling anybody to blindly trust polls. There's obviously a lot [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2564.44s)]
*  of problems with kind of big polling. When you see a 40 point swing, essentially in four years, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2572.52s)]
*  from any demographic group, that is something worth paying attention to. That is just unheard [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2582.84s)]
*  of. A 40 point swing in one demographic. In this case, it's immigrants. And look, even at the [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2588.76s)]
*  numbers that he ran through there in the presidential election, what was it? He got 20, 27% to 29% or [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2597.48s)]
*  whatever. There was essentially no difference between 2016 and 2020. This difference all comes [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2604.6000000000004s)]
*  between 2020 and 2024. And what happened in those four years? It was Joe Biden. It was Joe Biden [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2611.16s)]
*  having record high numbers of illegal border crossings in his admit that just, as we've said [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2619.64s)]
*  before on the show, you cannot overstate how much this pushed the country right on immigration, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2625.16s)]
*  to the point that even immigrants here, but you know, Rob, it kind of makes sense when you think [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2631.48s)]
*  about it. I mean, why would somebody who immigrated from South America be happy to have people [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2638.36s)]
*  standing on their burning cars saying this is Mexico? Isn't that what you were escaping [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2647.2400000000002s)]
*  when you wanted to come here? And so it is just something it's like, as you see this fight [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2653.56s)]
*  being led look like if you're picking a fight, and and the fight is about something that's deeply [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2659.56s)]
*  unpopular, and you're on the wrong side of the popularity of that issue, you would think that [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2668.28s)]
*  would be something to think about that you might go, ah, geez, you know, this could end up not [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2673.48s)]
*  working out so good for us. And again, I thought that this was something that, you know, I thought [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2679.0s)]
*  that Governor DeSantis in Florida did a did a great job when he made the fight about teaching [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2685.0s)]
*  gender insanity to under third graders and drew, you know, he kind of drew the Democrats onto his [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2692.92s)]
*  turf and then made them fight about that. So much of politics is about making your winning issue, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2699.6400000000003s)]
*  the issue that you're going to fight about. And it seems to me that that's what Donald Trump is [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2707.08s)]
*  able to do here in California. And, you know, you look at it that when even CNN has to admit [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2711.6400000000003s)]
*  that, like, this is a losing issue for us. I just don't see how this doesn't end up working [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2717.4s)]
*  out as a political victory for Donald Trump. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2723.64s)]
*  our sponsor for today's show, which is Prolon. Forget everything you know about fasting. Prolon [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2727.88s)]
*  by El Nutra is the only patented fasting mimicking diet that combines the benefits of prolonged [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2734.2000000000003s)]
*  fasting with a science back nutrition plan so you can hit your health and weight loss goals [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2740.6s)]
*  without actually having to give up all the food. You guys have heard about these fasting diets. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2745.88s)]
*  They're all the rage these days. This is what everybody's doing. But now there's a diet that [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2750.52s)]
*  essentially tricks your body into thinking you're fasting without actually having to give up the [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2755.0s)]
*  food. Prolon is a revolutionary plant based nutrition program that nourishes the body while [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2759.56s)]
*  making cells believe they are fasting. Proton isn't a diet. It's science, science based on [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2765.4s)]
*  Nobel Prize winning discoveries in medicine. And all of this starts with Prolon's five day program. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2771.08s)]
*  Snacks, soups and beverages all designed to keep your body in a fasting state. It's unlike anything [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2776.68s)]
*  you've ever experienced. And right now, Prolon is offering part of the problem listeners 15% off [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2782.2799999999997s)]
*  their five day nutrition program. Just go to ProlonLife.com slash P O T P that's P R O L O N L I [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2788.36s)]
*  F E dot com slash P O T P for this special offer. ProlonLife.com slash P O T P for 15% [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2797.8s)]
*  off their five day nutrition program. All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2806.52s)]
*  The the better approach for the Democrats is as you said, people do not like widespread illegal [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2810.28s)]
*  immigration. They would like to see control over the border. And they'd like to see a little bit [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2815.96s)]
*  of a correction from what happened under the Biden administration. And they want to see law [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2820.28s)]
*  unordered in the cities. They don't want to see rioting. So I think getting mad at Donald Trump [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2825.56s)]
*  for making sure that there's no riots and for enacting an agenda of deporting people that cross [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2830.36s)]
*  the border illegally, you're not going to win that fight with the American people. The fight that you [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2836.2799999999997s)]
*  will win is the human stories of people that have been here for 10 to 20 years that have been working [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2840.6s)]
*  jobs and paying taxes. If they start getting rounded up and they're being deported, that's a [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2847.32s)]
*  winning fight. If you want to start doing human interest stories of the guy at the pizza shop or [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2852.68s)]
*  the guy who was working next to people on a construction site, everyone liked him and that [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2856.68s)]
*  guy getting deported, you will change the immigration policy to force Donald Trump to not be focusing on [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2861.3199999999997s)]
*  those individuals and to trying to screen not deporting individuals that at least local [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2868.2s)]
*  communities seem to appreciate them having around. The problem with the Democrats is they don't want [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2873.8799999999997s)]
*  to actually force Donald Trump to do anything that's good. They just want to make him look bad no [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2878.52s)]
*  matter what. So they don't actually care about good outcomes or they don't care about, hey, let's work [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2882.6s)]
*  with you on this policy and make sure that it gets implemented in the way that we like. They would [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2887.88s)]
*  rather try and just have political theater of failures that they can scream about and so that's [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2891.72s)]
*  why they were trying to win with the, hey, this is authoritarian because they love that message [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2896.92s)]
*  of sending the military in here. But they're not going to win these storylines because Americans [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2901.96s)]
*  don't want total disorder in the country and they don't want widespread illegal immigration and they're [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2906.36s)]
*  a little bit sick of the Democratic Party and the liberal media lying to them about these issues. So [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2911.32s)]
*  I agree with you that they're, not that I want to give more tips to the Democrats, but they're [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2916.52s)]
*  picking the wrong fights here. Well, I agree with what you're saying. I do think that [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2922.6000000000004s)]
*  there's one of the dynamics that puts the Democrats in a very difficult position even to make that [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2930.44s)]
*  sell of what you're arguing there is that so many of them, like I'm sure Swalwell, I mean, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2936.36s)]
*  I'd have to go double check, but I'm sure I'm right about this because he never does anything [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2942.2000000000003s)]
*  other than just repeat the official party line. But that they, through the height of the worst [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2946.28s)]
*  of the migrant crisis in Joe Biden's presidency, the standard talking point for almost all of it, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2954.1200000000003s)]
*  for the first three years of his administration, at least in the fourth year when it was an election [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2962.6s)]
*  year, they kind of pivoted and changed to like, oh yeah, this is a real bad crisis, but it's [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2967.2400000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump's fault for killing this bill or whatever. But for the first three years, it was [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2972.52s)]
*  there is no crisis. That was their talking point. There is, I don't even know what you're talking [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2977.88s)]
*  about. Everything's fine. No, that's just like what the racist nativists say. There's no crisis. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2982.92s)]
*  Everything's fine. And so you really do lose a tremendous amount of credibility when the last [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2987.56s)]
*  time your party held power, they not only didn't do anything to solve this crisis, they just gaslit [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=2995.56s)]
*  you and told you there is no crisis. So it's a tough game. Even if you were just going to pick [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3002.6s)]
*  those like maybe unpopular examples of deportations, it's a very tough game to convince people that [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3008.52s)]
*  you're not just on that side. You're not just like, oh, okay, you're just trying. You know what I'm [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3015.64s)]
*  saying? But here they're not even trying. They're not even trying. They're just sitting here saying [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3019.64s)]
*  like, what? I don't know. The idea of executing deportations is terrible and horrible and whatever, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3025.56s)]
*  you know, violence in the street is somehow justified or can be downplayed. And, you know, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3031.48s)]
*  again, I've seen like a bunch of the coverage over the last 48 hours or so, and so much of it, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3039.16s)]
*  like, you know, much like in 2020, when I saw even Jimmy Kimmel, oh my God, just doing more, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3049.08s)]
*  you know, so I just never watch any of those guys, but I saw one of his clips going viral. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3058.36s)]
*  Just so pathetic and cringey that they're just sitting there. Just again, just downplaying. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3062.52s)]
*  Literally uses the term mostly peaceful, mostly peaceful as if that's like, look, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3069.32s)]
*  I don't know who still needs to hear this after all of these years, but mostly peaceful is not [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3077.4s)]
*  a defense of anything that it just doesn't. Everything is mostly peaceful. OJ Simpson was [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3083.7200000000003s)]
*  mostly peaceful. If you take away that one night where he double homicide, you know, where he did [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3091.08s)]
*  the double murder, aside from that, he was mostly peaceful. Even this is crazy, Rob, even the day [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3095.88s)]
*  that he killed those people, he was mostly peaceful through that day. There was really just that one [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3101.3199999999997s)]
*  half hour where he was cutting heads off the rest of the day. He was mostly peaceful, but you can't [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3107.4s)]
*  like, I don't know. It's just not the way things work. If you're having like you could maybe, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3112.7599999999998s)]
*  if you had a protest movement nationwide and in every single state, there were no incidents of [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3119.3199999999997s)]
*  violence and in one state there were like, you know, like a handful of violent cases. Like maybe [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3127.08s)]
*  you could plausibly say like, Hey, look, this has, but you can't characterize this as a violent [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3133.08s)]
*  movement. But when you have a protest and there's fires all over the place and there's stores being [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3136.7599999999998s)]
*  and there's stores being looted and there's people being assaulted, that's not a peaceful [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3146.7599999999998s)]
*  protest anymore. Like, yes, that that violence now characterizes the event. Sorry, that's just the [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3151.72s)]
*  way things work. Like, I don't know what to say. You can't like, it just doesn't work that way. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3158.92s)]
*  And, you know, good luck. Good luck with that propaganda that this is, oh, he's overreacting. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3166.7599999999998s)]
*  It's mostly peaceful. It's like, dude, there's enough images of violence there. There's enough [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3174.28s)]
*  images of property destruction that it is it is reasonable to characterize the thing as a riot. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3179.88s)]
*  Sorry. I don't know. Here any if anyone wants to put some questions in the chat, I will try to get [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3187.0s)]
*  to a couple of those before we before we wrap up. I did see someone posted that. Yes, I am. I'm going [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3194.1200000000003s)]
*  on with Andrew Wilson at 5 p.m. Eastern. That's exclusive to Rumble, I believe. But yes, I'll be [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3201.64s)]
*  on there. So that should be that should be a fun time. Let me see if there's anything else here. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3209.56s)]
*  If you have a question, go ahead and throw that in the chat now and then I will try my best [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3219.7999999999997s)]
*  headline tomorrow. Dave Smith calls OJ the most peaceful person ever. Yeah, something like that. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3224.6s)]
*  Getting taken out of context is par for the course. But yeah, I am. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3231.48s)]
*  It's a who's better blacks or Mexicans? It's a good question, Rob. You want to tackle that one? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3239.08s)]
*  I'll leave that to the chat. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3248.6s)]
*  That's a nice one. They're all they're all good people, all fine people. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3249.64s)]
*  Dave thoughts on Trump not denying Elon's Epstein tweet. Well, I mean, my assumption there would be [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3258.68s)]
*  that Donald Trump probably doesn't want to bring any more attention to that tweet than it already [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3267.56s)]
*  got. I'll weigh in on that one. Sure. Elon Musk statement was that Donald Trump was in the Epstein [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3272.44s)]
*  file. And we already saw footage of Donald Trump hanging out with Epstein. So the idea that anyone [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3279.56s)]
*  partied or was with Epstein, maybe even a minute down, that doesn't necessarily mean that they're [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3286.52s)]
*  all like, I could see myself, you get an invite to a party at a party like, shit, I'm at the wrong [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3291.96s)]
*  party here. And you go back and you close your door or whatever. So I'm just saying his statement [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3296.6s)]
*  was not I know Donald Trump is a pedophile, or I know that Donald Trump had a criminal relationship [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3301.96s)]
*  with Epstein. His statement was just he's in the files. Now, is him being in the files also the [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3309.08s)]
*  reason why they're being held up, which makes it a more juicy story that it's bad politically for [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3315.32s)]
*  Donald Trump to be bringing any more attention to unwinding the Epstein story? That's possible. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3320.44s)]
*  I'm just saying that it was almost a Donald Trump style statement of making something that [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3325.0s)]
*  sounds really big, but there's actually you're not really saying much. So, you know, I understand [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3331.88s)]
*  why he did it. He was pissed off with Donald Trump. And it might even be an accurate claim that Donald [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3339.0s)]
*  Trump is in the Epstein's file. But that doesn't mean it was an actual claim that Donald Trump [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3343.96s)]
*  was engaged in criminal activity with kids. Yeah, I mean, it's also look, it is the case, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3348.92s)]
*  and I'm not trying to defend anybody, you know, particularly here. But there's there's been lots [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3355.7200000000003s)]
*  of people both with Epstein and with with Puffy, where there's been people I've seen, you know, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3361.48s)]
*  like who are like associated with them, who have been asked in interviews, and they've been like, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3369.48s)]
*  Yeah, look, I went to parties, but I never was a part of like any of that stuff. And that is [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3373.56s)]
*  possible. Like, I'm sure that is the truth for a lot of people. I'm not saying anything about anyone [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3379.72s)]
*  specifically, because who the hell knows. But like, I do remember when the the Louis CK, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3384.28s)]
*  me too story first broke out, I remember a lot of people would like be like, all the comedians knew, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3391.4s)]
*  they all knew, and they protected them for years. And, you know, like, I was never friends with [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3397.2400000000002s)]
*  Louis CK. But like, you know, I don't know. Yeah. The truth is that I think all of us had heard [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3402.28s)]
*  rumors. But I've heard rumors about things that turned out not to be true. And in fact, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3411.0s)]
*  the rumors were not exactly what ended up coming out. I had heard rumors that were actually much [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3416.76s)]
*  worse than what actually happened or seems to have happened or worse than what anyone ever accused [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3421.24s)]
*  him of. And so like, you are like, it is quite possible that there were people around Jeffrey [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3426.36s)]
*  Epstein, even who had heard rumors about what was going on. But like, you don't know for sure, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3431.72s)]
*  and you weren't necessarily part of it. Again, this is why you'd want to have the tapes, you know, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3436.36s)]
*  maybe not released, but whatever you'd want to have the people who are on the tapes released, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3443.4s)]
*  you'd want to have the files unredacted release. So we actually know what's what. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3447.32s)]
*  Anyway, I agree with your point. It should be noted as Natalie did point out in the chat there [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3452.2000000000003s)]
*  that Elon Musk did delete the tweet and he later apologized, kind of a vague apology. But he kind [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3456.52s)]
*  of apologized for like taking it too far when he was fighting with him. So, you know, it is what it [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3463.56s)]
*  is. I don't expect there to be a big public reconciliation anytime soon between Trump and [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3469.32s)]
*  Elon Musk. But take it for what it is. I don't know. I summed up that argument on Twitter of [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3473.7999999999997s)]
*  Elon basically going, I'm richer than you. And then Donald Trump going not for long motherfucker. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3482.36s)]
*  And, you know, Elon Musk has definitely helped him get into office. And that's part of politics. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3488.28s)]
*  And sometimes he used people and send them packing. And, you know, the storyline of Doge was quite an [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3494.76s)]
*  exciting storyline on the campaign trail. And Elon Musk backing Donald Trump was an exciting storyline. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3500.84s)]
*  But doesn't seem like Donald Trump seriously wants to reduce government spending in any capacity. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3507.4s)]
*  And that at this time, you never know with Donald Trump, it's hard to bet against him and [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3512.52s)]
*  see how he changes. But at least on that one topic, it really doesn't seem like he's got any [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3517.72s)]
*  interest or concerns about, you know, the way that our government is spending money. That's why he [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3522.2s)]
*  likes low interest rates and will push for big bills. And I'm sure for Elon Musk, having taken [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3527.48s)]
*  the risk for his company, taking that job, having his company be hated by the Democrats now, and [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3533.56s)]
*  and then to have Donald Trump not even go with the slight cuts that were recommended or found by Doge, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3541.48s)]
*  you know, I recently pissed him off. And he realized, oh, you can't have fights with Donald [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3548.2s)]
*  Trump in public because it's going to cost it's going to cost you too much personally. It's just [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3552.4399999999996s)]
*  not worth it. Yep. Yeah. I think that's just about right. All right. Here, I'll ask this one. And [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3557.08s)]
*  this will be the last one. This is Cash Patel seemingly doesn't know basic facts about the [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3563.8799999999997s)]
*  Epstein situation. Total embarrassment. Well, more of a comment than a than a question. I would say, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3572.04s)]
*  I think that is the most generous interpretation of it. He doesn't know the facts. I don't think [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3579.56s)]
*  that that's the case at all. I think he knows. But I would agree with your characterization. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3585.56s)]
*  That was such an interesting Rogan appearance because, you know, I don't know, they're good [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3590.84s)]
*  at like just kind of keeping the the volleyball up in the air and teasing the storylines. So, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3595.4s)]
*  you know, he starts teasing for Fauci that the American people have a right to know if he was [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3602.28s)]
*  involved in criminal activities. And now there's new evidence. We have a phone and we're going to [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3608.04s)]
*  look into the phone. Can't tell you any specifics. Can't tell you if anything good is going to come [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3612.2000000000003s)]
*  from it. But the American people have a right to know. So what's interesting is that there's [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3616.6s)]
*  at least a change here of government not lying to you and saying, hey, that's the Lord of Science [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3619.88s)]
*  and you all have to listen to him. So there's something interesting about someone in government [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3624.84s)]
*  willing to go there. There might have been criminal. That's already such a shift to go from [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3628.76s)]
*  Lord of Science to there might be criminal activity here and the American people have a [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3632.6000000000004s)]
*  right to know. That's already a paradigm shift. But then you still end up in the exact same place of [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3636.04s)]
*  well, we're taking it seriously. We're as concerned as you are. We have new evidence but I can't share [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3641.6400000000003s)]
*  any of it with you. And then particularly on the Epstein storyline where he's still, hey, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3646.2000000000003s)]
*  I can't show you the tapes but let me tell you, I've seen the tapes and that guy definitely [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3650.84s)]
*  killed himself. On the Epstein storyline at this time also once again, it seems like the administration [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3654.84s)]
*  is not serious about having any transparency about what took place there. Yeah, no, 100%. And it's [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3660.04s)]
*  interesting to see, you know, like it's easy when you're the flamethrower on the outside who's [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3668.04s)]
*  talking about all the criminals in government. But then as soon as you get in there and it's kind of [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFNQS4zMcM&t=3675.56s)]
