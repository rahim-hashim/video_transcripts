# Dave Smith | Responding to Konstantin | Part Of The Problem 1256
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4)
*  What's up? What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the fire. Bernstein. How are you today, sir? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm doing well, Mr. Smith. How about yourself? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=16.8s)]
*  Very good. Very good. It's a, it's a beautiful day outside. It feels like spring is finally [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=19.88s)]
*  here, Rob. I think it's going to be 80 degrees today. So I'm gonna have to trade in this [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=25.0s)]
*  hoodie for a t-shirt after this podcast and go tits and some baby. There you go. Now there's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=29.68s)]
*  a, there's a visual for you. All right. Okay. So let's, let's jump into this today. You [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=35.84s)]
*  know, I was a full disclosure. I was a little conflicted about whether or not to even do [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=44.16s)]
*  a response to this, but I decided to be full go unsquashed. Well, you know, look, I did [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=50.44s)]
*  it. I do. I feel like I, you know, I, at the risk of, I don't want to beat some of these [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=59.64s)]
*  topics to death. But at the same time, you know, when somebody's make, when somebody's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=64.56s)]
*  specifically making content about you and it's being viewed by hundreds of thousands [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=72.44s)]
*  of people, there does, you know, there there's a feeling of like, well, I should respond [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=77.48s)]
*  to this, especially when I think they're making very bad arguments, dockingly bad arguments, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=82.36s)]
*  I would say. And, you know, look, I mean, this, this debate is just, it's been huge. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  It's really been unbelievable to me that it just has not stopped. Like I kind of thought [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  it would be like a few days being crazy, but it is just, there were a couple of weeks later [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  and it is still just, you know, really crazy, the response to it. And anyway, so the video, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=103.4s)]
*  I'm going to respond to Constantine Cassin's video. He, we've tweeted back and forth many [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=111.48s)]
*  times over the years at each other, but recently this morning, he, he irked me a little bit [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=119.88s)]
*  with something he said. So I was like, all right, you know what, maybe it makes sense [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=125.64s)]
*  to do a response to this. He certainly seems to want to jump in to the conversation. So [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=129.24s)]
*  let's do it. I, as I've said before, many times I, I, I claim the right to respond when I am [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=134.4s)]
*  criticized. And so this is, I'll be exercising that right today. I do think, and I'll, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=142.96s)]
*  I'll be obliged. Yes. Well, look, I mean, me, me and Constantine, I think have, you know, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  I don't remember every interaction, but I think we've done a pretty good job of remaining civil [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  while going back and forth and disagreeing on things. It seems to me like over the last couple [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=162.48s)]
*  times he's tweeted at me that that civility is, is going away a little bit. I'm, you know, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=167.28s)]
*  like I always am. I'm, I'm, my starting point is always like, let's talk about the ideas. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=173.04s)]
*  Let's debate the issues. But if you want to be insulting and vicious, it's like, okay, I'll, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=179.28s)]
*  I'll do that too. If that's what you want, I'll kind of try. I'm going to try my best not to do [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=183.76s)]
*  that. In this episode, he did tweet at me something this morning about how he's always said I was very [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=188.4s)]
*  intelligent, but now he's beginning to question that or something like that. And it's just, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  you know, with all of these things, it's like, look, I get into sparring with people and I'm on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=199.84s)]
*  Twitter and I do, you know, internet debates and stuff. And so I've, I've been a part of all of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  this. The truth is that I really do care about the issues that I'm talking about. And I just find them [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=211.36s)]
*  to be much more interesting. Like I don't give a shit what Constantine, what Constantine thinks [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=218.0s)]
*  of my intelligence. Like who cares? It's just the most uninteresting and unimportant thing. Anyway, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=222.72s)]
*  what I do care about is some of the ideas that he's presenting here. So he made a, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=230.48s)]
*  well, he wrote an article and that this is how he does it. He like writes articles and then he [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=236.24s)]
*  reads them. So we'll, we'll go through the video cause that's a better, more enjoyable way to do [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  it for podcast listeners. So let's jump into it. This was a Constantine Cassins take on the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=246.32s)]
*  debate between me and Douglas Murray. And he did, excuse me, playing there. He did say, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=253.6s)]
*  which was interesting that this is his most read article ever. And you know, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=260.4s)]
*  probably just because it was, you know, you have a debate on Joe Rogan. There's just not that many [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=266.32s)]
*  debates on Joe Rogan's show and it's the biggest show. And we had, you know, two big names [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=272.16s)]
*  debating about the most contentious issues. So it makes sense to me that this would be a, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=278.0s)]
*  you know, a widely read article. All right, let's sorry, go ahead, Natalie, you can play it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=282.24s)]
*  Prepare for the unprecedented. I'm about to admit I was wrong for years. I've celebrated the rise of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  new media and its impact on our ability to seek truth, challenge false narratives peddled by [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=297.52s)]
*  legacy institutions and transform the way we conduct our public debate. The rationale behind [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=302.56s)]
*  my thought process seemed solid. After all, the medium is the message. The reason I thought our [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=307.84s)]
*  conversations about politics, culture, and entertainment had become so fake was the rapidly [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=313.76s)]
*  shrinking sound bite and a media elite more interested in winning than learning. Journalism, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  academia and politics merged into a monoculture whose consensus rested primarily on the vigorous [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=324.24s)]
*  inhalation of gases emanating from their own backsides into which they'd firmly inserted [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=330.24s)]
*  their heads. I don't know anyone who voted for Trump was their mantra. Far from being a confession [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=335.2s)]
*  of ignorance and a lack of perspective, this phrase was uttered with pride at dinner parties [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=341.04s)]
*  to signal membership of the elite class. The response from this contingent to the sequential [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=345.76s)]
*  dismantling of their core assumptions about the way the world works was an attempt to use [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=350.8s)]
*  credentialism to make reality go away. Experts think vaccinating newborns against COVID is [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=355.12s)]
*  essential. Now pipe down, mask up and follow the science. In decades past, absent the ability to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=360.8s)]
*  make their voices heard, the pros would have had to grumble away about big pharma in obscurity as [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=367.2s)]
*  people, mostly hippie lefties, had been doing for ages. But thanks to the technological revolution, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=372.56s)]
*  which reduced the cost of running a major broadcasting channel from millions of dollars [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=378.32s)]
*  to the price of a smartphone, the era of gatekeeping was well and truly over. The discredited [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=382.24s)]
*  mainstream media continued to peddle lie after lie in an attempt to keep its political opponents [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=388.24s)]
*  from governing and being reelected. But it then faced a powerful counterweight. Elon Musk ended [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=393.76s)]
*  the regime of censorship and enforcement bias in the digital public square of Twitter, declaring [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=399.68s)]
*  You are the media now, as major podcasts and YouTube shows secured audiences most mainstream [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=404.96s)]
*  media outlets can now only dream of. By the time of the last year's presidential election in America, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=410.56s)]
*  the rise of new media had become undeniable, with many rightly calling it the podcast election. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=416.32s)]
*  Curious, open-minded, inquisitive podcasters, unrestrained by the need to comply with corporate [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=422.0s)]
*  media message discipline and social media censorship, were finally able to speak freely, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  seek the truth, and debate controversial ideas in good faith in front of grateful [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=432.64s)]
*  audiences of millions. So far, so wonderful. We could pause it right there. After all, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=437.28s)]
*  I could not agree more with the so far so wonderful point. So this is, I mean, I think a pretty good [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  start that me and you, Rob, would probably largely agree with. I mean, I do think to some degree, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=447.36s)]
*  he's still, he's underselling exactly how corrupt and evil the old media guard was. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=453.2s)]
*  But more or less, that's, I think what he's starting with there is exactly right. And it's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=460.24s)]
*  exactly the type of stuff that we've been saying for a long time on this show. There's just no [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=464.56s)]
*  question that this is what's happened. I mean, the corporate media lost all of their trust. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=471.36s)]
*  They were lying and weaponizing these lies to maintain power. It got to a point where everyone [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=478.56s)]
*  saw through it, and now people are pursuing alternate voices. I guess the only thing in there [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  that I'd kind of disagree with is that there was never, you know, when he says the era of gatekeeping [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=489.6s)]
*  was finally over. Well, that's not exactly ever true. It's never the case that there's no gatekeeping. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=495.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like, there's always, it's just became a much more decentralized [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=504.0s)]
*  group of gatekeepers. But there's still always going to be some voices who get in and some voices [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=509.04s)]
*  who don't. Every show, no matter what the show is, they get to choose who they have on and who they [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=516.08s)]
*  don't have on. It's just that you don't get to gatekeep in the same way. So like, let's say, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=521.2s)]
*  for example, you're talking about the idea of vaccines. Well, the pharmaceutical companies [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=529.44s)]
*  with their somewhat significant influence over the corporate media can gatekeep voices like Bobby [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=534.32s)]
*  Kennedy from ever getting on there. But if Joe Rogan wants to have Bobby Kennedy on, there's nothing [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  they could do about it. The same can also be said for the military industrial complex. I mean, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=545.6s)]
*  if you turn on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News, you are hearing from former CIA director, former Pentagon [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=550.24s)]
*  employee, former director of national intelligence. But you're not hearing voices like whether left or [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=559.44s)]
*  right. You're just not hearing the people who are outside of that. We're very rarely hearing the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=567.6s)]
*  people who are outside of that establishment. But now Dr. Carlson gets to decide. It's not up to [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=571.6s)]
*  some suit in a corporation somewhere. It's up to the guy who's built the trust with his audience, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=579.2s)]
*  like it or not. So anyway, that would just be my only bit of critique there. But a good start from [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=585.52s)]
*  Constantin Kyssin. It seems like we've got a great bit of content here. He gets it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=591.2s)]
*  We'll see. Any thoughts on any of this, Rob? Well, I'm looking forward to the pivot. Hey, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=599.12s)]
*  but there's this one thing that's just too important for people to be allowed to have free. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  But not Israel. Everything else is fine. Just not. We got wars to fight here. And that's different [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=611.4399999999999s)]
*  than when you heard that pitch from people that wanted to tell you that about global warming. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=616.88s)]
*  And that's different than when you heard it about COVID. And it's different when you heard it [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=620.64s)]
*  countless other times. But this one is actually so important that we can't allow for that freedom [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=624.88s)]
*  thing because people are getting it wrong. There you go. Okay, let's keep playing. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=630.88s)]
*  Oh, what could go wrong with democratizing information? Well, as it turns out, quite a lot. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=639.36s)]
*  Just as the assumptions of the elite class were proved wrong by the actions of their fellow [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=645.68s)]
*  citizens during the era of Trump, Brexit and COVID, the assumptions some of us held about [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=649.44s)]
*  the future of the media are now crumbling before our very eyes. With politics becoming the primary [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=654.4s)]
*  form of entertainment in Western society, more of us now get our news and opinions from entertainers [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  rather than serious commentators. And just as importantly, we often struggle to tell the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=666.0s)]
*  difference between the two. Now, having transitioned from a career in comedy to my current role as [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=670.8s)]
*  writer, interviewer and political commentator, I can hardly complain about the meshing of culture, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=676.0s)]
*  politics and entertainment. And I am not complaining. I'm merely pointing out that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=681.12s)]
*  the incentive structures and thought patterns we would typically associate with the entertainment [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=686.48s)]
*  business are not the same as those we would expect to see in journalism and academia. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=691.04s)]
*  This difference was perfectly illustrated in the recent debate between journalist and author [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=696.0s)]
*  Douglas Murray and comedian and podcaster Dave Smith on the Joe Rogan Experience, the world's [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=700.32s)]
*  biggest podcast. Officially, the full three hour discussion was mostly about the wars in [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=705.52s)]
*  Gaza and Ukraine, with Smith being in the so-called anti-war camp and Murray being a [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=709.84s)]
*  supporter of both Israel's campaign to eliminate Hamas and Ukraine struggled to retain its [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  sovereignty and independence. These conflicts and both men's positions have been debated endlessly. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=720.08s)]
*  That part of the discussion is less relevant here. The much more interesting fault lines [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=726.0s)]
*  were exposed on the fringes of the debate. The conversation began with the... [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  The... [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=734.56s)]
*  That's a mighty convenient approach to have. It's a mighty convene... Sorry, go ahead. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=737.28s)]
*  ...the bulk of the conversation or the substance of it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  Like, I mean, it's wild to me how many people who want to find a way to defend Douglas Murray in [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  this debate, which just on so many levels to me seems to be like a crazy losing game. Like, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=754.64s)]
*  why would you want to go down with this sinking ship? But okay. But really to just brush away, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=761.04s)]
*  forget about any of the content of the debate. That's been debated before. Well, okay, but like, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=767.84s)]
*  there's two wars raging on right now. Again, as I've made the point before, I often call what's [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  going on in Gaza a war. Not really sure that's the appropriate name for it. But no, I am sorry, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=780.3199999999999s)]
*  especially if you're going to be talking about like journalistic standards and the difference [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=787.36s)]
*  between entertainers and commentators, which again, as Constantine admits himself, he's [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=793.76s)]
*  essentially the same thing I am. I mean, I guess he doesn't still do comedy. I still do comedy, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=801.36s)]
*  but he's a guy talking about issues that he cares about on a podcast who is not an expert in any of [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=807.04s)]
*  these areas. But it is, isn't it awfully convenient how there could be so much discussed and written [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=814.16s)]
*  about, you know, like the, the, my standards or my lack of expertise or all of this, and none of them [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=824.64s)]
*  ever want to do is point to like, they've got these five things wrong. Douglas Murray demonstrated [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  his expertise in this point. It's never that. And in fact, he just openly imagine like starting [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=840.64s)]
*  your review of a debate and then openly going, Hey, I'm not so interested in the debate. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=846.24s)]
*  That forget that part. But how about the other part? Like we're whatever. I will see what he's [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=851.84s)]
*  about to say here, but it is just, I don't know. I do find it incredibly revealing that anybody [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=857.04s)]
*  would, would be giving their take writing their most read article on a debate and just totally [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=864.4799999999999s)]
*  take a back door out of the substance of any of the debate. I don't know. It's very strange. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=870.9599999999999s)]
*  There's an old man. This is my most, my most read article I've ever written. It was about the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=877.04s)]
*  Lakers Knicks game last night, but forget about the game. Let's just talk about the half time show or [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=881.8399999999999s)]
*  whatever. It's just very bizarre to me, but all right. And do they have a specific credentialing [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=888.56s)]
*  system that they'd like to speak to for who would be qualified to be a commentator on these issues? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=894.7199999999999s)]
*  Cause I feel like if you took our track record against Rachel Maddow, we probably have a better [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=900.16s)]
*  track record of a better political analysis about basically everything from the time that I've been [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=905.52s)]
*  on this podcast. So we'll be back to just if MSNBC platform someone is, are they endorsing [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=910.7199999999999s)]
*  Rachel Maddow right now and saying that that's the kind of expert class that we should be listening [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=916.0s)]
*  to or what, what is there some sort of a test people are supposed to take and what test would [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=920.8s)]
*  be better than the track record of commentary and the legacy of getting things right than you and I [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=925.12s)]
*  have. So I'm curious to know in this discussion of that we need to go back to some sort of a [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=930.16s)]
*  credentialing standard. What specifically is the standard that they're advocating for? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=935.68s)]
*  And then give me, give me the specific names who were supposed to be the voices of reason [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=941.68s)]
*  or where are they supposed to have come from that they now have the standard of a stamp of [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=946.16s)]
*  approval? What is the, what is, no, we can't just, you, Rob, you can't just have podcasters [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=949.76s)]
*  talking about these things as a podcaster. I mean, there's no problem having Dave Rubin [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=956.4s)]
*  and Bill Maher talk about them. We need experts, but like they're supposed to be extra. No, no, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=962.56s)]
*  what this all is, is just a naked, like, I don't like that. They disagree with me. I don't like [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=970.24s)]
*  the people who are critical of Israel or critical of Ukraine. I don't like them getting platformed. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=976.32s)]
*  Essentially what's happening here. And this is just the fact, right? Is that our side is winning. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=981.44s)]
*  We're winning the battle on the podcast front. And yes, I mean, Constantine kind of lays it out [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=989.2s)]
*  there. Yes, this became the new center of where the American political conversation is happening. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=994.72s)]
*  And because, and in large part, it's because, well, I mean, it's a mix of things, but in large [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1001.84s)]
*  part, it has to do with the fact that the biggest podcasters happen to be really open to this anti- [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1008.5600000000001s)]
*  war point of view, you know, and they, they've heard people make the anti-war argument and they're [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1015.2s)]
*  like, shit, that is really compelling. In the case of Tucker Carlson, for example, I mean, he's [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1022.0s)]
*  really like, you know, what went from being kind of like essentially a neocon and then went to Iraq, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1026.56s)]
*  he's been, he's been there and then got turned around on it and was like, oh my God, this is a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1032.96s)]
*  disaster, what we're doing here. But so because of that now, the gatekeepers, the new decentralized [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1039.12s)]
*  gatekeepers aren't keeping the anti-war voices out. And so we've got a shot now to make our [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1046.16s)]
*  argument and we're winning. And then you could see this in opinion polls, support for the war [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1051.68s)]
*  in Ukraine has gone way down since the beginning of the war and support for the war or Israel's [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1056.96s)]
*  assault on Gaza has gone way down, particularly with the younger generation. And so this is [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1062.8s)]
*  essentially it. It's like you're losing the argument. And so now we got to figure out, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1069.04s)]
*  you know, how to plug up this hole. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1074.24s)]
*  for today's show, which is Monetary Metals, an amazing company run by amazing people. They [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1078.96s)]
*  are revolutionizing the way you invest in gold and silver. They've been paying interest in silver [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1084.48s)]
*  and gold for over eight years, helping you grow your wealth in real tangible assets. Finally, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1090.48s)]
*  there's a true alternative to saving in dollars, a yield on gold and silver with Monetary Metals. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1096.48s)]
*  Listen, I know a lot of people who listen to my show own precious metals. And if you just, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1102.8s)]
*  if you're owning physical gold or physical silver and you're paying storage fees or whatever, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1107.84s)]
*  however you're doing it, there's a better way. And it's Monetary Metals. Now you can make interest [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1113.76s)]
*  on your gold paid in gold or interest on your silver paid in silver. It's really, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1120.24s)]
*  it's revolutionary. And like I said, they're great people who run the company. So please go check [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1126.24s)]
*  them out. Monetary-metals.com. That's Monetary-metals.com. All right, let's get back into the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1131.04s)]
*  show. Anyway, let's keep playing and see. I think we should reenact Biden's disinformation [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1138.3999999999999s)]
*  approach and make sure the internet content like this is removed from the internet because it's [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1143.44s)]
*  just as it's too dangerous for people to hear. The new Ministry of Truth can be Douglas Murray [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1147.92s)]
*  and Constantine Cassin. Maybe the FCC should take over podcasting and also make sure that there's no [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1154.56s)]
*  curse words or sexual content of any kind. I mean, what legislative body is supposed to [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1160.48s)]
*  reside over this misinformation on the internet and make sure that it does not appear so that [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1166.96s)]
*  Israel can continue to have public support? Well, it's, let's see if Constantine lays it out. It's [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1173.2s)]
*  an interesting question, Rob. Here, let's keep playing. Discussion of Rogan's decision to host [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1178.72s)]
*  Daryl Cooper, a man described by Tucker Carlson as America's most important popular historian. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1184.48s)]
*  Cooper himself has the self-awareness not to own the label of historian, instead describing himself [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1190.4s)]
*  as a storyteller. His latest work is a series whose aim is to show World War II from the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1195.84s)]
*  perspective of the Germans. To those who have studied World War II extensively like Murray, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1201.52s)]
*  Cooper's comments on Tucker Carlson's show and his podcast with Joe Rogan are obvious and frankly [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1206.56s)]
*  boringly familiar, Nazi apologia. Far from being novel, the idea peddled by Cooper the [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1211.76s)]
*  Churchill was a warmonger who, quote, turned the invasion of Poland into a global war because, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1217.44s)]
*  quote, he was funded by Zionist financiers, formed the core of wartime propaganda fabricated by [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1222.8799999999999s)]
*  Nazi spin doctor Joseph Goebbels. The argument that Cooper advances. So is Douglas Murray [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1229.2s)]
*  the credentialed historian that gets to legislate what history is supposed to take place on the [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1236.16s)]
*  internet or is it supposed to be some sort of other administrative body that should be able to [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1240.56s)]
*  rule in Douglas's favor? Is there a court in which the opinion should be presented? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1245.76s)]
*  Because if you notice, Rob, it's a very good point because if you notice and then, you know, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1249.6799999999998s)]
*  he's veering into Constantine here, which is again, it's identical to woke leftists. I don't [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1253.44s)]
*  even know. I know sometimes I'll argue that they're the woke right, but they're not. They're the left. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  They're just woke. I don't know. It's, oh, yes, Nazi apology. If you're not even allowed to discuss [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1264.08s)]
*  these issues, you're not allowed to look at anything from the other point of view, even when [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1269.68s)]
*  he says things that are mainstream history. Like there's the, you know, like the claim that Adolf [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1274.24s)]
*  Hitler was downplaying his anti-Semitism in the early thirties. There's, I'm blinking on the [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1280.88s)]
*  historian's name, but he did a whole thing on this about how at the at the Olympics, I think it was [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1286.0s)]
*  the Sagar and Jetty was just talking about this on Breaking Points, but or maybe it was Ryan. One [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1291.6000000000001s)]
*  of them was talking about this, but it's a, but I had read this book many years ago, but there's [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1296.96s)]
*  at the ninth, I think it was 1936 Olympics. The ones that are in Germany, the ones where you see [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1303.76s)]
*  Hitler tweaking out like a maniac there. They like took down a whole bunch of the anti-Jewish stuff [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1307.8400000000001s)]
*  when they were hosting the Olympics because they kind of knew this isn't going to play that well [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1314.56s)]
*  in the rest of the world. And this is before the war. They were still kind of, you know, you're [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1318.24s)]
*  like all nations, nation states, you know, they're, they're trying to maintain good standing, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1321.84s)]
*  but anyway, it's just, oh, you're a Nazi. You're not, this is straight from Gerbils or something. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1326.8s)]
*  It's like just so cheap and lame, but to your point, he just kind of throws in there as an [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1330.08s)]
*  assertion that to people who have really studied world war II, like Douglas Murray, like what, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1336.8799999999999s)]
*  they never seem to have to explain like by what metric have you decided that Douglas [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1344.56s)]
*  Murray has studied world war II more than Darrell Cooper. Like, listen again, there's, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1351.12s)]
*  there are levels to intelligence and there are levels to knowledge. And I think that [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1359.28s)]
*  like, this is one of the things when I was admitting, I'm not an expert, like I've had [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1367.2s)]
*  a lot of people on Twitter be like, Dave, you are an expert. You should just say you're an expert, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1371.52s)]
*  dude, and be done with this like debate. And it's like, no, I'm not. Here's the thing. It's like, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1375.52s)]
*  in the same way that you could like, okay, let's, let's imagine me and you are sitting down and, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1379.28s)]
*  or we're, let's say we're playing basketball and there is a, the, the number one high school player [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1386.96s)]
*  in America. Like, is that, you know, you're talking like Kobe Bryant when he was 17 is sitting there [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1394.4s)]
*  and it'd be very easy for me to you and me and you to be like, that's the best basketball player [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1400.48s)]
*  in the world. Like, this is just insane. He just did a 360 dunk. This guy's lightning quick. He's [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1404.32s)]
*  six foot eight. This guy's just incredible. But then like to someone who plays in the NBA, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1409.04s)]
*  they'd be like, slow down, like there's levels to this shit. And much like as a lot of people [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1413.44s)]
*  who fight, they talk about this. It's like the better at fighting you get, the more you realize [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1419.6s)]
*  how much you suck at fighting, you know, because you like, but you become a purple belt and it's [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1424.8s)]
*  like, Oh my God, you could kick anybody's ass. And you're like, I roll with brown belts and [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1429.44s)]
*  black belts all day. I could not kick anybody. So anyway, I say all of that just to say this [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1432.48s)]
*  for anybody who's consumed Darrell Cooper's work feel, however you feel about him, you could [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1438.4s)]
*  completely disagree with his politics or his conclusions or any of this. The dude is insanely [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1443.28s)]
*  well researched, insane. Like, I mean, I genuinely think he's probably read over a hundred books [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1449.92s)]
*  about Israel, Palestine, like he's read everything, dude, like it's just, and so for him to just [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1460.3200000000002s)]
*  casually, and I just, and I know Darrell and I know there are anybody who actually knows his work [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1465.8400000000001s)]
*  knows like if he's doing a world war two series, he is going to be reading everything about it. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1471.2s)]
*  So how he just gets to claim that Douglas Murray really does his research and he does, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1479.04s)]
*  do you guys ever feel the need? Like, do you ever have to show your work on these claims? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1484.0s)]
*  How do you know that? How do you know what Douglas Murray's read versus what Darrell Cooper's read? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1488.24s)]
*  By what metric are you making the decision that he's the one who's done his research and he isn't? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1493.04s)]
*  I don't, by the way, that doesn't mean who's right or wrong. These are two very different [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1502.96s)]
*  claims, right? Like there are people who are extremely well read, who are wrong about [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1508.0s)]
*  everything politically, but like the way they just get to play this game and just dismiss Darrell, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1513.52s)]
*  it's, it's pathetic. It's like, this is not again, not an argument. None of this is an argument. This [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1519.6s)]
*  is just assertions backed by nothing. We need censorship because too many people are listening [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1526.72s)]
*  to the other people. It seems to be what it boils down to, but okay, let's say, I mean, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1532.88s)]
*  they would claim they're not advocating censorship, but it's like, what exactly are [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1538.72s)]
*  you advocating then? You're, are you advocating Joe Rogan stop having me and Darrell Cooper on the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1542.0800000000002s)]
*  show? Cause what's really the substantive difference between that and advocating censorship? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1547.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, only their credentialed people who aren't actually credentialed, such as Douglas Murray, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1553.0400000000002s)]
*  right? Who have lots of different opinions on lots of different subjects. We can hear from all of [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1558.4s)]
*  them. You could even be a comedian who hosts a podcast and then you could talk about serious [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1564.4s)]
*  things. We could have a range of opinions except for war, except for when it comes to war, in which [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1569.36s)]
*  case we all must be lockstep on the side of these disastrous conflicts that all of you guys support [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1575.76s)]
*  that never work out that never work out. You know, it's crazy. It's whatever. Anyway, it's, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1582.72s)]
*  I'm sure I know Douglas was saying he downplayed it. People have sent me since then, but I should [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1588.64s)]
*  have had the, this is one area I fucked up on a little bit. I should have had that more in the [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1593.3600000000001s)]
*  front of my mind. But when I was like, didn't you go to Ukraine and write that article saying the [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1596.88s)]
*  Ukraine will win? And he goes, no, I didn't say that. I said it was possible. Ukraine, go read [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1601.2s)]
*  the article. The line is Ukraine will win. Russia will lose. Okay. So sorry guys. Yeah. You guys got [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1605.76s)]
*  much like the COVID experts. You guys have been too spectacularly wrong for too long and you're [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1613.2s)]
*  losing. You're losing the arguments. Sometimes, you know, it's an expert from regime based on how [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1619.12s)]
*  many things they've got them wrong. And so perhaps that's specifically why we need to listen to these [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1624.16s)]
*  people more is because of their track record of getting things so wrong. That's how you know that [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1629.68s)]
*  they're credentialed regime experts. It does seem to be the standard. All right. Let's keep playing. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1633.6s)]
*  Millions of prisoners of war and civilians died on the Eastern front because the Nazis failed to [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1641.6799999999998s)]
*  plan properly for the invasion is simply a lie. There's extensive documentary evidence [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1646.08s)]
*  that confirms that the reason millions of prisoners of war and civilians died on the Eastern front [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1651.52s)]
*  is precisely because the Nazis succeeded in their plans. Because Murray's educated on this issue, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1655.76s)]
*  he assumes that everyone else, including Smith is too exasperated. He tries to explain that far [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1661.6s)]
*  from being revolutionary, these ideas have been pushed by discredited historians like David Irving [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1668.08s)]
*  for decades. Have you listened to his podcast though? Okay. Here's just pause it for a second. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1673.1999999999998s)]
*  So here's just an interesting little thing that you might notice. And again, listen, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1679.6s)]
*  Constantine, like what you're engaged in here is propaganda. Like this is just pure bullshit. And [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1683.9199999999998s)]
*  it's not again, it's always what it always relies on. Like if you notice with these videos, right? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1689.36s)]
*  And this is why I say it's propaganda. You're reviewing a debate and brushing aside the debate. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1695.12s)]
*  You're talking about expertise, but you're not pointing out anything that I got wrong. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1701.2s)]
*  You're not with Daryl Cooper. You're not going, okay, here he had the fear and loathing in the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1704.72s)]
*  new Jerusalem or he had the anti-humans or he said these big huge series. And you're not going like [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1709.44s)]
*  this is riddled with inaccuracies. And here are five of them. You're not doing that. What you're [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1713.68s)]
*  doing is taking a couple of sentences, taking them wildly out of context, misrepresenting them. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1718.32s)]
*  What Daryl Cooper actually said, he did not make the claim that the Nazis didn't intentionally [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1725.6799999999998s)]
*  kill people in Eastern Europe. That was not his claim. What he was saying was essentially, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1731.36s)]
*  and he said that this applies to Israel also. So what he started making this point, then Tucker [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1737.6s)]
*  kind of went on a different path and then he never got back to like really finishing the point. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1742.72s)]
*  But the thing he was making was actually what he was doing was attacking neo-Nazis. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1746.96s)]
*  Actually, what he was doing was attacking the defenders of the Nazi regime. He was saying that [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1753.92s)]
*  it doesn't even matter because you're responsible either way. So in other words, his point was, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1761.3600000000001s)]
*  Rob, I don't know if you saw him make this, but he was saying, listen, if you're Israel [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1767.68s)]
*  and you go into Gaza and then you don't have a plan for how to get innocent civilians to safety, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1772.08s)]
*  well, that's on you. And it doesn't matter whether it was intentional or not intentional [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1779.6799999999998s)]
*  or nothing. It's your responsibility now once you commit the invasion. And so likewise, he was [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1784.24s)]
*  saying, even to, because he, one of the things he brought up, and this is a, it was a letter from [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1789.6799999999998s)]
*  like one of the Nazis back to Germany who was out in Eastern Europe. And I guess it was, I think it [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1795.84s)]
*  was in 1940, if I'm remembering correctly. But so he said, basically they're right there in the [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1802.1599999999999s)]
*  middle of the war. There's a lot of devastation. And he was writing back going like, listen, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1806.48s)]
*  all these Jews that we got in these camps, or maybe not just the Jews, but whoever was in these [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1812.0s)]
*  concentration camps, he goes, I think a lot of them are going to starve to death and it might be [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1815.6s)]
*  more humane to just execute them or something like that. But Darrell was saying like, look, even if [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1820.08s)]
*  that's the case, that even if you're saying like, oh, it was just like in the war, they didn't mean [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1825.28s)]
*  to do any of this or nothing, he goes, it's still a bullshit excuse because it doesn't matter. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1831.2s)]
*  You invaded these countries, you set up these camps with no plans for how to take care of these [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1835.36s)]
*  people and you're still responsible for it. So he wasn't making the argument that they never did [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1839.76s)]
*  this intentionally. He was saying, even if you make that argument, the argument still fails. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1844.3999999999999s)]
*  That was the point. So again, you know, Darrell Cooper just wrote a piece the other day. I still [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1849.84s)]
*  have not gotten a chance to read it, but Darrell Cooper just wrote a piece last week, like [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1854.24s)]
*  condemning anti-Semitism. None of them will ever bring that one up. You know, they always bring up [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1860.4s)]
*  the three lines that they like to take out of context. They never bring that up. But aside from [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1865.76s)]
*  that, there's, you know, a constant in here, and this is what I mean, like when it's starting to [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1871.92s)]
*  get into propaganda, is that he sits there and he goes, actually, you know what, bring it back a [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1880.88s)]
*  second, Natalie, because I want to make sure, let me get this right, because I distracted myself [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1889.5200000000002s)]
*  from this rant. Just bring it back a few seconds because I want to get the point that he was making. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1893.7600000000002s)]
*  Far from being revolutionary. These ideas have been pushed by this guy that his story is like. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1897.2s)]
*  Okay, you can stop it right there. Thank you. That's all I needed. So this is the other thing [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1902.16s)]
*  that's propaganda here. Okay. And you remember, I give Michael Malice a lot of credit for being [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1905.6000000000001s)]
*  the one who pointed this out to me. And then as soon as he points it out, you go, that'll really, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1910.0s)]
*  really good point. But his point was because you remember when they tried to cancel Joe Rogan [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1913.6s)]
*  last time, I'm sorry that I might've brought another one on him, but it'll fail. So it's cool. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1918.08s)]
*  But so last time they were trying to cancel him over the COVID stuff. And you remember, do you [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1926.32s)]
*  guys remember, I'm sure Natalie, you weren't with us on the show there, but I'm sure you remember [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1930.8s)]
*  this point, every single person in the corporate media, all of them all said horse dewormer. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1934.16s)]
*  Joe Rogan is taking horse dewormer. Now I've remectin the drug. First of all, it's, I think [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1944.24s)]
*  it's been prescribed a billion times to people. It's quite, it's a very, there are people have won [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1951.1200000000001s)]
*  Nobel prizes for Ivermectin and stuff. It's like, it's, it's, it's people medicine. Now it's also [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1956.64s)]
*  veterinary medicine, but it's given to like hundreds of different species of animals. Now, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1962.64s)]
*  one of those things is for horse deworming. And yet they all picked that one. Like just think about [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1968.48s)]
*  that from like a mathematical point of view, like the odds of that are like one in a hundred billion [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1978.48s)]
*  or something like that, that you would all pick the one thing. If there's like tens of thousands [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1985.92s)]
*  of different options and every single person in the mainstream media happened to pick this one. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1991.76s)]
*  Why is that? Okay. Because they all decided that this was the most discrediting thing to say [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=1999.44s)]
*  that this is the thing that would make him look the worst. So likewise, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2006.0s)]
*  where'd you get David Irving from? Why are you saying, okay, now it is true that David Irving [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2010.08s)]
*  may have shared some of these views, but Pappy Cannon wrote a whole book about it. Pappy Cannon [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2016.24s)]
*  was a speechwriter for Richard Nixon. He worked in the Ronald Reagan White House. And I think he [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2022.08s)]
*  worked in one of the, I believe he was in three White Houses. He ran for president twice. He's a [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2028.0s)]
*  New York Times best seller. He was on TV and wrote a very successful column for like 50 years. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2034.64s)]
*  He's a household name more or less in this space. Why aren't you picking him? Why are you saying [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2042.32s)]
*  this is from David Irving? You know why Rob? Cause David Irving was also a Holocaust revisionist. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2048.64s)]
*  He also, I don't remember. I don't know enough to know exactly. They call him a Holocaust denier. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2052.88s)]
*  I think, I think his argument was that it was like a couple million people, but it wasn't six [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2057.7599999999998s)]
*  million people, regardless of any of that, they could, you know what I mean? Like say, oh, he's [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2062.72s)]
*  regurgitating Pappy Cannon's thing. Why do they all pick David Irving for the obvious guilt by [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2068.72s)]
*  association thing to smear him as a Holocaust denier, even though he's never once done that. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2075.52s)]
*  Like I'm sorry, this is a woke leftist tactic. Like I don't, you know, this is why it's such a [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2083.2s)]
*  losing, like all of this to me and don't get me wrong. I'm taking on this stuff. Cause I think [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2089.2799999999997s)]
*  it's, it's a bad argument. I think they're wrong. And I, I'm, I'm actually shocked by how bad the [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2094.4s)]
*  argument is, but what the thing that's been so strange for me over the last couple of weeks [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2100.48s)]
*  is that you're just like, I can't believe you guys all want to go down this path. Like you really want [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2105.76s)]
*  to sit here and argue on behalf of the expert class and the, you know, the, oh, these, these issues [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2110.8s)]
*  have been dealt with long ago, but what does that mean? You know, like when, when someone like [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2115.92s)]
*  Constantine will say the reason why Douglas Murray is so frustrated because we've already batted down [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2121.52s)]
*  all these stupid ideas. But, you know, I think for a lot of us, we go, oh yeah. But that was back when [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2126.64s)]
*  the evil machine had full control of everything. Maybe we didn't really back down these ideas. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2135.68s)]
*  Maybe Papu Cannon was right about all those things he was saying. I mean, I don't know, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2141.44s)]
*  you know, the, yes, it is true to some degree that Douglas Murray's ideas won the day [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2145.6s)]
*  and people like Papu Cannon and Ron Paul's ideas lost the day, but what have we gotten for that? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2150.88s)]
*  And, you know, at a certain point, if we figure out that we've been lied to about everything for [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2156.7200000000003s)]
*  the last 20 years, some people might go, well, what were they saying 30 years ago? What were they [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2161.92s)]
*  saying 40 years ago? What were they saying 60 years ago? It's a natural reaction. It doesn't [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2168.0s)]
*  mean everything they were saying is wrong, but it definitely means you can't just dismiss it away as [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2174.96s)]
*  that's already been taken care of. Sorry, we've seen how this machine works. Okay, let's keep playing. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2180.0s)]
*  Okay. Have you listened to his podcast though, Rogan interjects? It turns out Murray hasn't, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2189.04s)]
*  and this is later used as evidence against him after the episode airs. Unlike Murray, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2194.72s)]
*  I have listened to Cooper's podcast, including the one about the history of Palestine that people [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2199.4399999999996s)]
*  often cite in his defense. He details the persecution of Jews preceding the events he covers, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2204.24s)]
*  and so he couldn't possibly be anti-Semitic is their argument. From this, they conclude that he [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2209.3599999999997s)]
*  couldn't possibly be a Nazi apologist. The reason they make this logical error is that in the [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2213.9199999999996s)]
*  entertainment world, words do not have meanings, they have feelings. And thanks to the woke left's [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2218.4799999999996s)]
*  misuse of the word Nazi for the last decade, in podcastistan, the term is not descriptive label, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2223.7599999999998s)]
*  but a vague meaningless insult used to cancel people. Unlike his opponents, Murray clearly [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2230.2400000000002s)]
*  understands that the term Nazi apologist has a defined meaning. And the fact that most Nazi [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2235.76s)]
*  apologists are anti-Semitic does not mean you have to be anti-Semitic to fit the description. The [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2241.1200000000003s)]
*  GroK definition of a Nazi apologist is someone who defends, justifies, and minimizes the actions, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2246.7200000000003s)]
*  ideology, or atrocities committed by the Nazi regime, often by excusing Nazi policies or [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2252.5600000000004s)]
*  promoting revisionist narratives that distort historical facts. Since Cooper does precisely this. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2258.32s)]
*  No, he fucking doesn't. Even by your dumb GroK definition, Cooper does not do that. But hey, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2264.6400000000003s)]
*  listen, this is like, again, I'm just so sick of like having the same argument over and over again. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2271.84s)]
*  He's about to put a World War II series out. I say he's not going to minimize the Nazi atrocities [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2277.04s)]
*  you clearly think he's going to. Let's see who's right. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2282.64s)]
*  Let's see who's right when it comes out. Okay. And like, yeah, I mean, again, it's almost like [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2287.04s)]
*  we're getting into this territory. In fact, I don't know if you remember this, Rob. I believe [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2292.8799999999997s)]
*  we played it on the show, but there was this great moment that Sam Harris, my dear friend, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2298.16s)]
*  had when he had Chelsea Handler on his show. And they were talking, I think it was about Bill Burr, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2306.64s)]
*  but I'm not sure about that. But someone, I think Sam, I don't remember exactly how it went. But [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2315.12s)]
*  the idea of having black friends got brought up. And it was like, oh, he's not racist. He has a [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2321.52s)]
*  black wife. And she goes, Oh, yeah, but that's the old, you know, I'm not racist. I have black [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2326.48s)]
*  friends. And then Sam just destroys her on it. And he goes, No, I know the left like does this [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2332.3199999999997s)]
*  thing where they just repeat that over and over again, until it becomes like a trope. But like, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2338.8799999999997s)]
*  that's actually very good evidence that you're not racist. It's excellent evidence. Now, I am [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2344.72s)]
*  not saying it is technically impossible to be married to a black woman and hate black people. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2349.6s)]
*  I suppose you could hate your wife, you could make an exception for your wife and hate all other [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2357.52s)]
*  black, like, okay, but it is really damn good evidence. Like, it literally is on the level of [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2361.68s)]
*  if if I was like, Hey, Rob, you hate eggs. And you were like, I don't hate eggs. I had scrambled [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2369.12s)]
*  eggs for breakfast. And I go, Oh, that's what they all say. They all said scrambled eggs for [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2374.96s)]
*  breakfast. And you're like, No, that's a very good defense. Again, saying you don't now, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2380.3199999999997s)]
*  technically speaking, is it possible that you hate eggs, and you just force feed yourself eggs [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2384.8799999999997s)]
*  every morning, even though they discussed like, yeah, I guess technically it's possible. But it [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2391.12s)]
*  is like, overwhelming evidence in the direction that you like eggs, if you eat them for breakfast. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2395.52s)]
*  In a very similar sense. Yes, it is very strong evidence that you're not a Jew hater that you're [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2404.08s)]
*  not a Nazi apologist, if you detail in graphic brutal detail, the horrific treatment of Jewish [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2410.96s)]
*  people in Europe. Yes, those two things don't jive together. And you got to really jump through [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2418.08s)]
*  some mental hoops in order to tell yourself that no, they don't. It's pretty straightforward. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2424.0s)]
*  All right, let's keep playing. Several appearances on major podcasts, how his series on Palestine [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2430.88s)]
*  will change this reality is clearly as confusing to Murray who hasn't listened to it as it is to me [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2437.44s)]
*  who has indeed one of the main areas of misunderstanding in the discussion is the role [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2443.44s)]
*  of expertise. He doesn't claim to be an expert is Smith's repost to Murray's suggestion that [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2448.48s)]
*  Cooper doesn't know what he's talking about. He uses the same defense when Murray questions [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2453.6800000000003s)]
*  Smith's own willingness to opine on geopolitics. The central critique of Murray here is that he's [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2458.1600000000003s)]
*  arguing from authority, which is what the mainstream media has done for years to gaslight [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2463.76s)]
*  the public about everything from transgenderism to COVID to war. Smith and his supporters argue [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2468.56s)]
*  that the concept of expertise has been so discredited that he and anyone else for that matter [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2475.12s)]
*  is entitled to express any view about any issue they want. The audience, they say, can judge these [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2480.0s)]
*  views for themselves. Murray's attempt to dismiss such views on the basis that they don't align with [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2486.16s)]
*  expert opinion is seen as an ineffective argument at best and an attempt at credentialism at worst. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2491.04s)]
*  There's a sliver of truth to this criticism. Engaging the argument someone is making directly [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2497.36s)]
*  is a much more powerful approach. But to suggest that arguments from authority are entirely invalid [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2502.6400000000003s)]
*  is silly. Almost everything you believe is based on an argument from authority. Light bulbs, for [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2508.7200000000003s)]
*  example, are a fairly unsophisticated and omnipresent part of our lives, yet the number of people [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2514.48s)]
*  watching this video who are capable of explaining how they work without resorting to arguments from [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2519.6800000000003s)]
*  authority will be vanishingly small. I'm not just talking about the fact that most people... [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2524.96s)]
*  This is what, Constantine starts doing this in a lot of his videos here and it's just, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2530.16s)]
*  you know, it's like the last time we took it apart when he's explaining first principles and just [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2534.32s)]
*  clearly does not know what a first principle is, like objectively, not my opinion or your opinion, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2538.16s)]
*  just like that's not what a first principle is. He goes, my first principle is that October 7th [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2543.2s)]
*  was wrong. Like, no, no, no, no, no, that's not how that works at all. He's just misusing terms here. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2547.12s)]
*  An argument from authority or an appeal to authority is a logical fallacy. Okay? It's [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2555.36s)]
*  saying that because somebody is an authority figure, therefore they are correct. What he's [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2560.32s)]
*  talking about is specialization, the division of labor, and the fact that human beings have [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2565.92s)]
*  very limited knowledge. I don't need to know anything about light bulbs. That's not an argument [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2571.84s)]
*  from authority. That's just I don't know and other people do and I judge it based on the fact that [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2578.4s)]
*  it seems to work. An appeal to authority would be if I were to say none of these lights are working, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2584.8s)]
*  none of these are turning on, and you were to say yes, they are because an electrician said so. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2593.6000000000004s)]
*  Do you get the difference? They're just different things. One's a logical fallacy and one is not. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2600.0s)]
*  But again, this is as I've made the point several times now, you can pick your logical fallacy here, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2604.4s)]
*  but Douglas Murray is clearly making one. It's either an appeal to authority or he's just [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2610.72s)]
*  straw manning because if you're saying that the claim here is that I don't think we need expertise, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2616.64s)]
*  so I've never said anything that even kind of indicated that. And in fact, as I go out of my [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2624.48s)]
*  way every time I'm on Joe Rogan's podcast, I make sure to mention all of the experts who have [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2628.7999999999997s)]
*  influenced my thinking on these topics. So again, it's just a non-argument. There's nothing here. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2635.36s)]
*  It's just not true. Yes, it is true that we rely on expertise. Nobody is arguing against expertise. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2642.0s)]
*  What I argued against was that the expert class should be the only ones who can weigh in on these [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2651.2000000000003s)]
*  topics, not that expertise isn't important. Again, as I've said over and over again, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2657.36s)]
*  if this really was Douglas Murray's argument, which it was a bit more than that, but if this [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2661.76s)]
*  really was his argument, then he could have stated it in one sentence and we could have moved on. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2667.92s)]
*  Hey, when you talk about these issues, it's really important to know what you're talking about. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2673.76s)]
*  You agree, Dave? You agree, Joe? Yes, 100% agree. Yes, 100% agree. Let's have the debate now. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2678.2400000000002s)]
*  That's it. Otherwise, you're just knocking down straw men. All right, guys, let's take a moment [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2684.6400000000003s)]
*  and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is the Ridge Wallet. I love the Ridge Wallet. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2689.2s)]
*  I'm a big, big fan. It's the coolest, sleekest, minimalist wallet. They've got a bunch of different [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2694.56s)]
*  designs and they're just really cool looking. It's like a great conversation starter. Also, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2700.48s)]
*  you don't need that big, old, bulky wallet. I think Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza figured [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2705.9199999999996s)]
*  this out 30 years ago, but you're throwing your spine out of alignment. You're sitting on a brick [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2712.96s)]
*  in your back pocket. All you need is the sleek little Ridge Wallet. It holds your cards and your [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2717.28s)]
*  cash, everything you really need. So make sure to go grab one. They also have an AirTag attachment, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2722.0s)]
*  so you'll always know exactly where your wallet is. You don't have to panic about losing it. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2728.0s)]
*  Ridge isn't just about wallets. They create premium, everyday carry essentials like key [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2731.92s)]
*  cases, suitcases, rings, all built with the same sleek, durable design. No matter what you pick, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2736.6400000000003s)]
*  Ridge has free shipping, a 99-day risk-free trial, and a lifetime warranty on all of their products. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2742.56s)]
*  So right now, Ridge is having their once-a-year anniversary sale. You can get up to 40% off at [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2749.2s)]
*  ridge.com slash p-o-t-p-10. That's the website. Head on over to ridge.com slash p-o-t-p-10 to see [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2754.96s)]
*  their biggest sale of the year. After you purchase, they will ask you where you heard about them. Please [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2763.36s)]
*  let them know that you heard on the part of the problem podcast. Ridge.com slash p-o-t-p-10. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2768.0s)]
*  All right, let's get back into the show. Anything you want to add, Robert? You want to jump back? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2774.08s)]
*  Light bulbs aren't real. And the only reason why racists will marry black people is because they [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2779.6s)]
*  have white vaginas. And I'd like to be on the record with both of these factual statements. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2785.44s)]
*  There you go. And he's an expert to this conversation. He's an expert folks. All right, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2790.72s)]
*  let's keep playing. People couldn't explain how electricity works. I'm talking about the fact that [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2795.68s)]
*  almost everyone who can will only be able to do so by quoting the work of other people rather than [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2802.0s)]
*  experiments and research they themselves have conducted. While Rogan seems to side with Smith [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2808.64s)]
*  in this exchange, it is highly unlikely he would adopt the same approach to his own areas of [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2813.44s)]
*  expertise. When it comes to mixed martial arts, his interview guests are the best of the best. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2818.72s)]
*  The dazzling array of UFC champions, top MMA coaches, respected trainers, and other experts [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2824.0s)]
*  does not appear to include comedian Dave Smith. There's a popular clip on the channel in which [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2830.64s)]
*  pause it for a second. Wrong. I've talked MMA a bunch with Joe on the podcast. You're just [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2836.88s)]
*  factually wrong. In fact, Joe talks MMA with comics all the time. And you know what he does [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2843.6s)]
*  is like, yeah, okay. It's an area that Joe has legit expertise in. And if they get something wrong, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2849.76s)]
*  he'll be like, nah, I think that's wrong. And if they get something right, he'll go great point. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2855.36s)]
*  That's exactly right. Cause he takes on what you're actually saying. He doesn't just say, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2858.8s)]
*  I'm the expert. Therefore, everything you say is wrong. So you just, just blatantly wrong, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2863.84s)]
*  terrible example and a terrible example to pick me up. Cause I've actually talked MMA a bunch with [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2869.1200000000003s)]
*  Joe on and off the podcast. Also the same example Douglas Murray used. Interesting. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2873.6s)]
*  I'll tell you something interesting about light bulbs. I don't understand how light bulbs work, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2880.72s)]
*  but I have electrocuted myself and from learned experience, I could tell you if you touch the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2885.44s)]
*  exposed light bulb, you might electrocute yourself. You know what else I can tell you from [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2891.2799999999997s)]
*  learned experience? If you consistently listen to regime experts, you're probably getting bad [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2894.96s)]
*  information. Now I might not actually be an expert in any of the topics that the regime tries to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2899.92s)]
*  pitch to me, but I can tell you more often than not from the 10 years of following these topics, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2905.92s)]
*  when the regime is really selling you on something, you might want to do your own homework [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2910.88s)]
*  because from my own experience, they seem to be lying a whole bunch. I don't need an expertise [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2914.7200000000003s)]
*  on light bulbs to tell you, hey, I touched one and I got electrocuted. Hey, you might be careful. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2919.84s)]
*  You might want to be careful touching that thing and don't use Christmas lights as a shower lights. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2924.08s)]
*  I can tell you that one. I'm not an electrician, but I learned my lesson on that one. Say, I don't [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2929.2s)]
*  know. It's just, it seems like a lot of fancy talk for, Hey, we need some censorship because [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2934.64s)]
*  I got a check from Israel and I got a word to sell here. It sure does feel that way. I will say it's [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2942.3199999999997s)]
*  like, again, you know, Bobby Kennedy made this point. There's a excellent point, but when someone [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2948.64s)]
*  said something, they hit him with this appeal to authority and they were like, well, the experts [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2954.08s)]
*  say that vaccines don't cause whatever negative outcomes. And he said something along the lines [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2957.92s)]
*  of, he goes, listen, when I, he's an environmental lawyer for many years and he was like every suit I [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2965.44s)]
*  ever brought the prosecution called expert witnesses and the defense called expert witnesses. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2970.16s)]
*  And every single time the experts completely disagreed, you know, you could find experts that [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2978.7200000000003s)]
*  said, Oh, there's this, this lake is horribly polluted. And then other experts would say, no, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2984.64s)]
*  this is a safe level. And so this is kind of where a lot of this breaks down too, is that you go, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2989.7599999999998s)]
*  it's always like, listen to the experts, but then it's also like, well, which experts, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2996.0s)]
*  which experts are you listening to? Are you arguing that there aren't experts who agree with what I [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=2999.92s)]
*  was saying? Is that really the claim here? It's like, okay, no, nobody's making that claim. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3005.92s)]
*  By the way, it's great. Like they, especially the pro Israel, it's like, they're like, we have to [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3011.52s)]
*  defer to the experts. And you're like, okay, every single international humanitarian organization [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3016.32s)]
*  claims that there's like a goddamn catastrophe going on over here and that it's war war crimes [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3020.4s)]
*  are being committed and have been for many, many decades. Like, okay, well not them. You go like, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3024.8s)]
*  then they appeal to international law. You go, well, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3028.96s)]
*  Netanyahu. No, no, no, no, that part's stupid. You know, it's like always like, okay, there's no [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3033.44s)]
*  list of X there's no shortage of experts who are critical of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3037.44s)]
*  So again, can we just have the actual debate? Can you make a real point? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3043.84s)]
*  Seems like you can't. All right, let's keep playing. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3049.04s)]
*  Smith breaks down why Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. I was unable to find one of him breaking [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3052.96s)]
*  down Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu moves, despite Smith possessing a similar level of expertise on both [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3058.88s)]
*  subjects. Smith and Rogan are irked when Murray expresses his befuddlement that Smith has become [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3064.32s)]
*  a prominent voice in the- Let's pause it right there. Okay, you're right. It didn't get clipped [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3069.2000000000003s)]
*  up. I mean, I have talked about Jiu-Jitsu on Rogan's podcast before and like, I don't know, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3076.48s)]
*  but just the point just fails because like I have talked to, I guess he's right. That clip, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3082.88s)]
*  they put out that clip and it went super viral. You notice again, what Konstantin's not doing [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3087.84s)]
*  is pointing out what I got wrong in the clip. He's not saying like, oh, he said this and he [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3095.5200000000004s)]
*  got it wrong. But I want you to genuinely ask yourself this, everybody who's listening, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3100.88s)]
*  because this is like a very basic honesty test here and Konstantin to you too, because I'm sure [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3105.0400000000004s)]
*  you'll watch this. How the fuck do you know what level of expertise I have about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3109.6000000000004s)]
*  compared to the cause of the Ukraine war? By what are you claiming to judge that? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3115.84s)]
*  I have the same level. You're just putting me at zero at both. Me and Konstantin debated Ukraine [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3122.32s)]
*  and like the general consensus was that I smoked him in the debate. So like what expertise does he [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3129.6800000000003s)]
*  think he has that I don't have? But how would you possibly know? How many books have I read [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3134.96s)]
*  about the lead up to the war in Ukraine? How do you know? You have no fucking idea. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3141.68s)]
*  You're just pretending you're lying. You're making this up. It's ridiculous. I mean, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3145.3599999999997s)]
*  like I would never, I don't know. I don't know. I just would never do this. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3151.9199999999996s)]
*  I would never engage in this tactic. I mean, it's possible that after smoking someone in a debate, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3156.64s)]
*  if it was like, okay, the one thing I could think of was when I debated Austin Peterson on Israel [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3161.7599999999998s)]
*  and it was coming off, he debated Clint Russell and then he debated me and they both went terribly [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3171.36s)]
*  bad for him. And at one point I remember, I mean, he got so much wrong, just didn't know it. At one [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3176.2400000000002s)]
*  point, Clint mentioned the Nakba and he goes, the Nakba, I haven't heard of that. I think you're [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3182.32s)]
*  referring to the Balfour declaration. And Clint was like, no, the Balfour declaration was in 1917. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3190.96s)]
*  We're talking about 1948 right now. And like, okay, so after that debate, and then after my [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3196.96s)]
*  debate, I did conclude, I go, I don't think this guy's ever read anything about this topic, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3201.76s)]
*  but it was like four reasons. You know, it was like, I think you're, you don't know what you're [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3205.84s)]
*  talking about for reasons. These guys seem to never feel the need to give any of the reasons. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3211.04s)]
*  Just asserted. Douglas Murray knows. Darrell Cooper doesn't. Dave Smith doesn't. Okay. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3217.2s)]
*  Dare to elaborate. All right, let's keep lying. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3223.6s)]
*  A big about Israel and Palestine without ever having visited the Middle East. The shock at the [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3227.2s)]
*  idea that someone ought to see things with their own eyes before commenting on them is palpable. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3234.64s)]
*  Indeed, in the aftermath of the debate, Smith promoted a popular video in which Murray's [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3239.68s)]
*  statements to this effect are contrasted with his previous ridicule of the concept of lived [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3244.64s)]
*  experience. This is very low quality thinking. If you do not see things with your own eyes, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3249.44s)]
*  your opinions are by definition, not your own. They are an agglomeration of opinions and facts [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3254.8s)]
*  you have gathered from other sources whose veracity you cannot properly evaluate. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3259.92s)]
*  That doesn't necessarily make them wrong. Indeed, most of our opinions about. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3264.56s)]
*  Now let's pause it right there. This is an absurd claim. Like just totally ridiculous. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3269.76s)]
*  Like just totally ridiculous. Your opinions aren't your own unless you've been to the place. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3277.04s)]
*  Like, I mean, I just do. I do not understand how those how he wrote that down. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3285.12s)]
*  Sent it out, then read the words in front of a camera and didn't think to himself. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3292.48s)]
*  Oh, wait, what? Wait, what am I saying exactly here? Your opinions aren't your own. If you got [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3297.92s)]
*  them from somebody else or if you haven't gone to the place before, like that just makes absolutely [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3304.88s)]
*  no sense. So you're saying if I let's just say you, you attend a debate between two experts. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3312.32s)]
*  Now the whole purpose of a debate, right, is to persuade the audience. You hear the arguments [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3321.2000000000003s)]
*  this guy makes, you hear the arguments this guy makes, you go, I think that guy made superior [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3325.52s)]
*  arguments. Oh, and he had no answer for that. And that, Ooh, that was a really good point. He just, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3329.28s)]
*  I think this guy's right on that issue. That's not my opinion now, because somebody else informed [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3333.36s)]
*  my opinion. By the way, the logical conclusion of this, you understand is that none of us have [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3339.52s)]
*  any opinions about anything. Because even going to a place, you're still being influenced by the [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3343.6800000000003s)]
*  people. Like, it's not as if, obviously, again, if Douglas isn't knocking down a straw man, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3348.8s)]
*  obviously, you can gain insight by traveling to a place. You could learn things that you didn't know [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3354.32s)]
*  before. But to pretend like by putting your feet on the soil, you magically now take in all of the [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3360.08s)]
*  information and everybody's experience and see it from everyone else's perspective is fucking [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3367.2s)]
*  ludicrous. And the idea that like, that's the only true opinion is if you go somewhere, like, anyway, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3373.36s)]
*  it's just, it makes absolutely no sense. No, you can gain. In fact, you can gain a lot more insight [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3381.04s)]
*  by reading experts than you can just by going on a trip. I mean, like, look, let's say, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3388.64s)]
*  Rob, me and you went, what was it two years ago now, we went on a European tour. We went to Ireland [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3395.6s)]
*  and Scotland and Amsterdam and London. I don't know too much about those countries' [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3405.2799999999997s)]
*  history. Like, I know a little bit here and there. I know mostly what kind of involves America, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3412.88s)]
*  you know what I mean? Like, are the areas I know most about. But like, okay, let's say we went, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3419.52s)]
*  we go to Ireland, right? If I were to do a deep dive on Ireland, the Irish history, the way I have [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3424.8s)]
*  on Israel, Palestine or Ukraine or, you know, any of the topics that I talk a lot about, like, let's [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3433.92s)]
*  just say if I were to read 15 books about the history of Ireland, okay, which I'm not going to [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3438.88s)]
*  do, but like I could do it if I had to. So let's just say I read 15 books. Are you honestly telling [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3445.92s)]
*  me that you think I would get more insight from our trip there than from reading 15 books about it? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3452.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, that's just not clear at all. But anyway, the idea that we don't have opinions unless [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3457.84s)]
*  we've been to the place and seen it with our own eyes, this makes no sense. This show is sponsored [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3466.32s)]

*  it, let me just say that I highly recommend therapy. It's something I've benefited from in [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3478.48s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. So conceptually, if I were to see a picture of [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3517.92s)]
*  the pyramids, I can't have an opinion that they're impressive because I haven't actually been there. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3522.56s)]
*  And inversely, if I read or see footage of the Holocaust in Auschwitz, I can't have the opinion [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3527.76s)]
*  that it's terrible because I wasn't there. And the only way that you could form an opinion is by [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3533.6s)]
*  actually being somewhere. So I guess the entire field of history, by the way, that doesn't exist. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3538.4s)]
*  I guess all of physics, I mean, I don't know how many people are in a lab observing the laws of [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3543.7599999999998s)]
*  physics. I guess maybe, I don't know, maybe that's not a good example. But there's entire fields of [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3548.24s)]
*  study that are conceptual. So absolutely. Or the idea that like an astrophysicist [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3552.8s)]
*  can't have a real opinion, only an astronaut can. Right? Like you haven't been there. So it's just, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3560.0s)]
*  I mean, literally, I'm shocked. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3568.48s)]
*  Right. I can't do the analytics about the being on Mars to try and plan for how someone could [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3571.12s)]
*  survive on Mars. I'd have to actually go to Mars. Yeah, it's not your opinion. The only way that I [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3576.64s)]
*  could decipher the information about how we might survive on Mars. I mean, I'm shocked. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3580.88s)]
*  There's never been a guy who's before he went to a factory was pulled in for a consulting job and [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3586.56s)]
*  then looked at the spreadsheets and the books to figure out what might actually help the company [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3591.52s)]
*  be more profitable. Never happened. Yeah. Well, it's again, like I said, I'm shocked and not like [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3595.84s)]
*  Douglas Murray was like being performative that he was shocked. I haven't been there. I'm genuinely [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3601.2000000000003s)]
*  shocked that Constantine would go down with this. It might be the worst argument I've ever heard. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3606.4s)]
*  Anyone like that? You don't have opinions unless you've been to the place. It's wild. All right. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3613.04s)]
*  Let's keep playing. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3618.96s)]
*  Oh, they are an agglomeration of opinions. In fact, you have gathered from other sources [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3619.52s)]
*  whose veracity you cannot properly evaluate. That doesn't necessarily make them wrong. Indeed. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3627.04s)]
*  What is this also? Pause it for a second. Why can't you evaluate other people's opinions? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3632.64s)]
*  You can't have an opinion. Like, why can't you evaluate somebody else's expertise? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3640.4s)]
*  If that's the case, true, then shouldn't nobody be allowed to side with Douglas Murray in the debate? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3646.32s)]
*  After all, they're just listening to another expert who's been there, right? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3651.92s)]
*  Expert. Anyway, let's keep playing. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3655.36s)]
*  Most things are not our own. You know why? Because we get them from people we consider [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3658.96s)]
*  to be authorities on the subject in question. You might call them experts. The great trick being [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3664.1600000000003s)]
*  deployed here is to allege that experts can't be trusted while relying on a different set of experts. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3670.4s)]
*  On Ukraine, the non-expert Smith is using the ideas of people he considers experts, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3676.2400000000002s)]
*  like John Mayersheimer and Jeffrey Sachs. On World War II, the non-expert Cooper [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3681.52s)]
*  deploys the arguments of people he considers experts, like David Irving, and so on and so forth. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3686.64s)]
*  All opinions are valid and should be given a hearing, screamed the people whose entire media [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3692.56s)]
*  diet is made up of people who only push the narrative they prefer. Who said that? Who said that? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3697.12s)]
*  Again, just blatant straw men. Yes, again, none of us were ever taken. Me or Joe were not arguing [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3706.16s)]
*  against expertise. And we were not saying, I certainly have never said I'm not informed by [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3714.64s)]
*  experts. Yes, I've read the experts that back up your side. I've read the experts that back up the [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3719.8399999999997s)]
*  other side. I think the ones on your side are full of shit and the other ones make much better [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3725.44s)]
*  arguments. That's my opinion on this. The point is that I still get to talk about this and I still [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3730.0s)]
*  get to have an opinion just like fucking you do, Constantine. This is just too nutty, dude. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3735.2000000000003s)]
*  You're in the process. I mean, isn't this, how is this not a performative contradiction of some [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3741.36s)]
*  sense, Rob? He's explaining all of this, right? On a podcast. Like, what? What are we talking [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3745.68s)]
*  about here? This is too crazy. I'll play a couple more minutes of that. I think we're just going [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3752.48s)]
*  to call it an episode because this is just too nutty. Really turning into the tables here. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3756.08s)]
*  Is the arguments he makes about countries he's never visited from other people. And the arguments [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3761.12s)]
*  are then judged not on whether they're true. Something Smith does not have the ability to assess, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3766.56s)]
*  but on whether they sound true. This is why he routine. I don't have the ability to assess the [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3771.6s)]
*  truth. So then get, okay, listen, but he does it. Then neither do you motherfucker. So you can't [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3778.16s)]
*  make that claim. This is it's you're in, you're contradicting yourself. It's like saying, okay, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3784.48s)]
*  it's like saying the truth doesn't exist. What's the problem with that sentence, Rob? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3790.8799999999997s)]
*  You're making a truth claim, right? If you're saying the truth doesn't exist, you're saying [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3796.64s)]
*  that's the truth. Well, then the truth would have to exist. It's a self contradicting statement. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3801.7599999999998s)]
*  If you're saying I can't assess the truth, then neither can you, dude. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3806.56s)]
*  By the way, you've also never been to Israel or Gaza. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3810.88s)]
*  So you can't have a comment on this either, or it just sounds true, right? No, this is, this is, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3815.04s)]
*  this is woke ism. This is postmodernism. This is, I mean, yeah, there's no truth. There's no way of [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3821.36s)]
*  knowing what truth is. Yes, there are things called facts and logic and regular people [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3827.2s)]
*  can actually use these things. All right, let's keep playing a little bit more and then we're [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3835.2s)]
*  going to wrap up. He makes basic cognitive errors of the kind I described the last time he and I [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3838.88s)]
*  sparred over my viral Israel video. As for experience, the woke concept of lived experience [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3845.7599999999998s)]
*  was not ridiculed because experience doesn't matter. You would have to be deeply dishonest [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3851.68s)]
*  to deny that experiences are informative. If Michael Jordan claimed that there's a correct [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3856.64s)]
*  way to dunk a basketball based on his experience and his conversations with Kobe Bryant, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3861.44s)]
*  do you imagine that Smith and his defenders would screech about MJ just using arguments from [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3866.8s)]
*  authority and lived experience? The reason many of us pushed back against the concept of lived [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3872.48s)]
*  experience, other than the great tautology. Well, like, yeah, we would if he was lying to us. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3877.28s)]
*  You know, like if he told you the best way to dunk a basketball is with your feet, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3885.84s)]
*  I'd be like, well, first off, that's illegal in basketball and that'll be a turnover. And also, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3890.4s)]
*  I've watched you dunk with your hands many, many times. Again, you could see, right, everyone could [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3896.64s)]
*  see this here. This is like a blatant straw man. No one's arguing against expertise and nobody's [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3902.2400000000002s)]
*  saying that your experience doesn't matter. The point is that to say something like your opinion's [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3907.76s)]
*  not valid because you've never been there isn't actually taking on someone's argument. And that [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3913.52s)]
*  is identical to the lived experience argument to just say that like, like, literally, the argument [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3919.28s)]
*  would go something like that. This is how the lived experience argument would go would be something [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3924.32s)]
*  like you'd be like, well, I'm looking at this data here and I can see the number of police [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3928.0800000000004s)]
*  shootings last year and I can see the number of unjustified police shootings here. And it's [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3932.4s)]
*  actually very, very few amount of black people were unarmed. Black people were killed by cops. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3936.8s)]
*  And it doesn't seem to be at a much higher rate than other races. And they'd go, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3942.0800000000004s)]
*  you've never been a black person. So you don't know what it's like. You don't have the lived [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3946.2400000000002s)]
*  experience that is identical to the argument Douglas Murray was making. It's not saying that [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3951.52s)]
*  like, look, here's the thing is that if I got into a debate with Michael Jordan about how to play [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3956.88s)]
*  basketball, he should just fucking school me at the debate. He shouldn't have to sit there and just [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3961.92s)]
*  tell me he's an expert the whole time. And if he was just telling me, then that's a non-argument. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3967.76s)]
*  And the thing about Michael Jordan is that he won a lot of championships, as did Kobe Bryant. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3973.76s)]
*  And so if they decided to talk about that topic, I go, wow, these are the experts. But when the [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3980.1600000000003s)]
*  expert class decides to tell me something and they've gotten it all wrong repeatedly, I go, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3985.28s)]
*  it's like if Michael Jordan broke his legs before he got to the NBA and never played basketball [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3991.84s)]
*  other than at the high school level. And then it's a good point. We judge him. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=3997.28s)]
*  Yeah. It's cause he won a lot. That's why you're even bringing up his name. It's cause he was right [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4002.2400000000002s)]
*  in the sense in your analogy, right? So like, yes, I suppose that if Douglas Murray, if the [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4006.2400000000002s)]
*  war in Iraq was a smashing success and then the war in Afghanistan was a smashing success, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4011.68s)]
*  and then the war in Libya was a smashing success, and then the war in Ukraine was a smashing success, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4015.84s)]
*  then yeah, maybe he'd get a little bit more of that respect. But the thing is he supported all [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4020.0s)]
*  of them and they were all unmitigated disasters while I was good on them. So yeah, forgive me if [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4024.0s)]
*  I don't just take him at his word and I'm going to insist that him or you, Constantine have to [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4029.6s)]
*  make a fucking argument, which none of this is. All right. We're going to wrap up on that. And I [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4034.48s)]
*  promise we will move on to other topics, but you know, they keep handing me free content and let's [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4041.12s)]
*  get real. It's fun. It's fun. People like it. There's always these episodes where people go like, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4045.04s)]
*  oh, I don't even like these episodes. And you're like, well, they do really good numbers. So I [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4049.52s)]
*  think, I think you do. All right, guys, we do got to wrap on that. Thank you very much for listening. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4053.12s)]
*  Catch you next time. Peace. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2kjl3a72h4&t=4057.92s)]
