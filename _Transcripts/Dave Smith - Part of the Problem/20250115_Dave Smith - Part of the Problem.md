*  And then we got a lot of stuff coming up the following week [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=62.2s)]
*  Fort Wayne, Indiana and Louisville, Kentucky comic Dave Smith comm for all of the ticket links plus a whole bunch of ticket links for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=66.44s)]
*  dates that we have later in the year and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=74.88s)]
*  yeah [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=77.28s)]
*  well, there is a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=78.44s)]
*  major news [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=80.12s)]
*  This morning in fact, maybe not even this morning. I think it was this afternoon that it became official [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=81.68s)]
*  I had earlier a few hours ago. I [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=88.0s)]
*  had [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=91.28s)]
*  Was we you know? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=92.4s)]
*  We're on a group text and we talk about different topics that we might be covering on the show and I had sent over [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=93.68s)]
*  a Dave DeKamp article from yesterday [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=99.44s)]
*  About this very topic, but now it seems to have become official since then by the way [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  Shout out to Dave DeKamp who's just his reporting is phenomenal [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=108.72s)]
*  If you want to keep up with with what's going on in all the wars [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=112.08s)]
*  You got to be reading Dave DeKamp and and the guys over at anti war comm I go there every day and it's you know [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=116.64s)]
*  People ask me a lot. How do you stay up on everything that's going on? That's a really a really really excellent tool for it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=122.72s)]
*  So anyway, it looks like there is a ceasefire agreement in place that has been agreed to by all parties [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=129.16s)]
*  The the piece that I was referring to that Dave DeKamp wrote the other day was that apparently Trump's envoy [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=138.22s)]
*  Went over and put some real pressure on Netanyahu and got them to agree to this ceasefire [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=146.38s)]
*  Hamas [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  Essentially has agreed to this deal for quite a while now [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=157.34s)]
*  There's there's a lot of moving pieces here [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=160.78s)]
*  So I want to get into kind of talking about all of this, but let me start by I'll just [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=163.26s)]
*  Hold on a second here. I have it here. Let's start. I'm just gonna read a little bit [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=168.38s)]
*  This is from the Los Angeles Times [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=172.94s)]
*  More than 15 months into Israel's I'm sorry [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  The the title is ceasefire deal reached between Israel and Hamas in Gaza a ceasefire deal promises to end more than a year [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=180.14s)]
*  of conflict in Gaza strip [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=187.46s)]
*  More than 15 months into Israel's devastating war with Hamas in the gap in the Gaza strip [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  The two sides have agreed to a ceasefire deal that would pause fighting and free some Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=194.74s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners according to US officials Wednesday [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  US Qatari and Egyptian negotiators spent months holding extensive rounds of talks with Israeli and Hamas leaders to broker [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=207.34s)]
*  What would bring a partial end to the conflict that has left 46,000 Palestinians dead [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=215.02s)]
*  around half [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  women and children [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=224.22000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian officials estimate for the record [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=226.5s)]
*  I think these numbers are way off but that's not really the point right now the war which [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  Destabilized the Middle East and unleashed protests across the US began on October 7th [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=232.94000000000003s)]
*  yada yada yada [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=238.3s)]
*  Israeli [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=239.9s)]
*  Israel immediately launched a relentless barrage of airstrikes stuff. We all know [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=240.94s)]
*  Anyway, that's that's essentially what we need to read. I guess that is the deal [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=247.62s)]
*  ceasefire [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=253.34s)]
*  Some you know, of course even the framing in the Los Angeles time is forget hostages versus prisoners and that whole debate [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=255.14s)]
*  But [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=263.18s)]
*  This is I think a very positive step obviously [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=265.18s)]
*  Donald Trump [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=270.22s)]
*  Again I want to say I had a tweet about this and it's all a big if at this point [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=273.42s)]
*  We don't know exactly what's gonna happen [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=277.86s)]
*  We don't know if this ceasefire is gonna stick [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  You know the way these things work this deal could fall through later today and you know [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=282.82000000000005s)]
*  We'll see what happens and and it's quite a leap from that that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=287.54s)]
*  The ceasefire will actually lead to like an end to the war [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  And of course there's also the possibility that a law after this pressure that it will be followed up with like a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=296.74s)]
*  giant concession to the Israelis [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=304.42s)]
*  Trump's got enough hardcore Zionists in his cabinet and inner circle that it's not impossible that that would happen, but I will say [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=307.5s)]
*  like a big if [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  but if Donald Trump [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=317.5s)]
*  Actually just pulled this off and if Donald Trump does successfully [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=320.74s)]
*  End this war [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=326.1s)]
*  He is starting his presidency as a hero [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=329.54s)]
*  I mean he's starting his second term as a straight-up legitimate heroic president if he I said this on Twitter earlier [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=332.42s)]
*  but if he is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=339.74s)]
*  Able to end this war and let's say he negotiates an end to the war in Ukraine to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=341.98s)]
*  Put him on Mount Rushmore [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  What can I say no matter what else he does those were be the two greatest accomplishments of his life [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=349.42s)]
*  The close third is working out the deal to end the war in Afghanistan [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=355.62s)]
*  But if he can accomplish both of those things put him on Mount Rushmore, and I also did offer on Twitter [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=359.70000000000005s)]
*  He can take Lincoln's spot [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=365.44s)]
*  Either that or Roosevelt do not come after my Thomas Jefferson [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=368.98s)]
*  But either of those guys can go anyway [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=373.98s)]
*  That's just a start but it does seem to be an interesting development [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=376.70000000000005s)]
*  Particularly given how pro-israel Trump is and how pro-israel his appointments have been it certainly does seem interesting that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=380.14s)]
*  He would be the guy who was able to pressure Netanyahu to take this deal [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=387.58s)]
*  Well, there's not much left to bomb in the region doesn't have any hospitals left. It seems like a bit of a Jew deal at this point [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=393.21999999999997s)]
*  Hey, we'll stop bombing you for 40 days if we can get back to hostages and they go alright [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=399.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=404.14s)]
*  I guess at this point that's all we're gonna get is 40 days for us to move back north move some bricks around and then [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=404.34s)]
*  For you to potentially come back in [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=409.78s)]
*  Well look that that certainly is possible [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=411.9s)]
*  Again, we will see it's very early in this thing to really know what this is gonna do [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=415.38s)]
*  But it's hard to not look at this [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=421.14s)]
*  You know as just a positive I wanted to um, it's also an interesting note [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  There was a piece Dave DeKamp again wrote a piece [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  earlier that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=435.5s)]
*  And this is really something [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=438.06s)]
*  Ben Gevier has threatened to quit the government. This is a Ben Gevier is the national security minister [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=440.06s)]
*  In Israel he has threatened to quit the government and called on finance minister finance minister [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=446.98s)]
*  Smocerich to join him [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=453.7s)]
*  because he's so opposed to any ceasefire deal and he [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=455.82s)]
*  He he favors, you know, just ethnically cleansing the region. But anyway, there are some people in herbal [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=461.02s)]
*  What was his name? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=467.02000000000004s)]
*  Good beer close very close though. I understand you could sometimes people mispronounce it [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=468.82s)]
*  the the reason I bring that up is not just to trash Gavir and Smocerich who always deserve it, but [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=473.22s)]
*  It makes it seem like the case for optimism about this is a little bit stronger when you have [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=481.98s)]
*  High-level people in the Israeli government pitching a fit like this [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=489.70000000000005s)]
*  You know what I'm saying like they're like seem to be setting up almost as if like you're you know what I mean [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=493.58000000000004s)]
*  You're betraying us or something that seems to indicate that they believe there's a real chance here that there's actually peace talks going on [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=498.98s)]
*  Listen all of that is very unclear obviously that it's just being reported 20 minutes before we started recording that this deal is official [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=509.1s)]
*  although it's been you know, it rumored for a couple days now, but [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=517.1s)]
*  You know another aspect to this that is almost just painful at this point, but what a humiliation [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=522.02s)]
*  for Biden [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=530.5799999999999s)]
*  you know and and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=532.14s)]
*  Biden is a guy who we are no fans of but man, it's like [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=534.02s)]
*  How much humiliation can one person take this is just a total humiliation to Biden and the entire [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=539.6199999999999s)]
*  Democratic Party in the middle of you know [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=547.46s)]
*  everything else between the election and the fires in Los Angeles and Mark Zuckerberg and like all these other factors to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=550.4200000000001s)]
*  Come in here and oh to look [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=558.22s)]
*  I'm not saying this is entirely true. There's lots of moving pieces with this but [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=561.98s)]
*  the idea that Trump's first envoy that he sends over there could immediately get [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=567.3000000000001s)]
*  Israel to snap into fall into line. I mean it's just like Joe Biden has just been like [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=574.38s)]
*  Just impotently threatening or not threatening but like impotently [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=582.22s)]
*  Signaling that he really wants [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=587.1s)]
*  Israel to not do this or he really wants them to not do that while they laugh in his face and do it for the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=589.26s)]
*  last year and a half and for Trump to just come in and demonstrate that you can just put a little bit of pressure on [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=594.9s)]
*  Them and get them right into ceasefire talks. I mean again, I can't stress there's nothing new about this deal [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=600.94s)]
*  This is the framework that's been on the table this whole time that Hamas has been repeatedly saying they agree to and it's just the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=607.5400000000001s)]
*  Israelis who won't agree to it like they're the impediment to peace here [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=615.58s)]
*  If Donald Trump is able to just come in before he even takes office [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=618.82s)]
*  He's able to get them to agree to that. It just shows how weak [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=622.5400000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden has been as a leader and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=627.62s)]
*  Look, I mean who could really be that surprised by that, right? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=630.26s)]
*  Like if you just look at it, you'd go. Oh, yeah [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=634.14s)]
*  Joe Biden is old and weak and Donald Trump for any of his faults is a [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=636.98s)]
*  Boss and a and a person like he exists and he's not just the machine running things [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=643.38s)]
*  Look, I don't know. I don't want to get too optimistic here [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=650.3399999999999s)]
*  It's also quite possible that there is something more that we're not exactly seeing going on here if that makes sense [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=654.18s)]
*  Obviously Donald Trump is very pro Israel. A lot of people in Israel are very pro Donald Trump [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=663.4599999999999s)]
*  It's quite possible that part of the calculation here is just that to make Joe Biden look really weak and make Trump look really strong [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=669.38s)]
*  but [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=677.18s)]
*  Either way, this is a positive development and and if nothing else, you know [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=679.3s)]
*  It's funny because I'm on I was just just for a few minutes, but I'm just kind of watching the reaction [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=683.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, I've been arguing with a lot of these like pro Israel guys on [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=689.62s)]
*  line online on Twitter for the last few days and it's a [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=693.3s)]
*  You know, it's been [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=698.14s)]
*  somewhat entertaining and somewhat frustrating but it's interesting to say to see [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=700.18s)]
*  How many of these pro Israel people are furious about this and they're all over Twitter just furious about the deal [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=705.02s)]
*  Seth Dillon from the Babylon Bay wrote a how can there be a deal with terrorists that doesn't involve [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=713.34s)]
*  unconditional surrender and [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=720.82s)]
*  Which I'm a smart ass so I responded back. It's gonna be very difficult to get a complete unconditional surrender out of Netanyahu [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=722.98s)]
*  but he's [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=730.4200000000001s)]
*  But you know, he's the Babylon B guys. I figured you could take a little joke, right? But [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=732.3000000000001s)]
*  It isn't it kind of interesting and I just I would say [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=736.9000000000001s)]
*  Incredibly revealing that for all of the and my god, I mean I've really is particularly over the last few days [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=741.54s)]
*  But really for the last, you know since at least since October 7th [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=748.18s)]
*  The how vicious [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=753.86s)]
*  People are coming at me. It's like oh, you're a Jew hater. You love terrorists [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=756.6999999999999s)]
*  you don't care about these Jewish children who were gone down at a music festival and all of this stuff and the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=761.74s)]
*  Meanwhile [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=768.7800000000001s)]
*  My attitude about this is like hey look even if this ceasefire deal doesn't hold [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=771.82s)]
*  Let's do [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=777.9000000000001s)]
*  Let's let's get some of these hostages back, right? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=779.86s)]
*  I mean that seems like at least a good at least if this ceasefire deal is gonna go into effect [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=782.1800000000001s)]
*  Then it seems like the first step here will be that there's gonna be some hostages freed [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=787.3000000000001s)]
*  I thought that was your whole thing, right? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=790.94s)]
*  This is what I've heard for over a year now that this is Israel's real concern is that there's these hostages being held [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=793.62s)]
*  Well, it looks like a deals in place where you're gonna get them back [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=799.9799999999999s)]
*  Shouldn't that be of like can't everyone consider that a win or was it never really about that? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=803.14s)]
*  And as Rob said you just ran out of hospitals to bomb [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=809.62s)]
*  Just saying if it's really about the hostages [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=813.2199999999999s)]
*  I think you would support this deal, but we'll see we'll see what uh, what ultimately ends up coming a ball of it [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=816.06s)]
*  Alright guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is lumen lumen is the world's first handheld metabolic coach [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=822.34s)]

*  15% off your purchase. Thank you to lumen for sponsoring today's episode. Let's get back into the show [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=902.26s)]
*  It does [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=909.38s)]
*  If if you say like if at least your starting point is let's just say that [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=912.3s)]
*  You think this is a good a good thing. It's better to have a ceasefire if you know again, like I said, I've I've [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=918.86s)]
*  listened to [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=925.86s)]
*  Countless [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=928.5s)]
*  Pro Israeli people tell me for well over a year now [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=929.66s)]
*  That their main concern is getting the hostages back and that they really do feel awful about the innocent Palestinians who are being killed [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=935.54s)]
*  Okay. Well, it seems like if you care about those two things this deal would be pretty good. But let's just say [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=944.14s)]
*  the [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=950.26s)]
*  Deal let's say even the prospects of the deal leading to an end to this war and actually an end [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=951.98s)]
*  Like if we could just start with the starting point that that's a good thing [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=957.46s)]
*  All right [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=962.22s)]
*  if that is your starting point that if the war were to end if the hostages were returned and [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=962.86s)]
*  Palestinians stopped being slaughtered and the war ends that would be a good thing [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=967.38s)]
*  Like let's just for the sake of being crazy. Let's suggest that that's good [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=971.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, then there's kind of something bigger that's revealed here [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=976.5400000000001s)]
*  Which that this deal was on the table this whole time and the only reason why it hasn't come to fruition yet is because [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=981.3000000000001s)]
*  Nobody put any pressure on the Israelis who by the way are [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=987.74s)]
*  objectively our [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=992.4200000000001s)]
*  fat welfare mom [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=994.74s)]
*  Like we're supporting them doing this. So like no one's able to put pressure on the regime who's conducting this brutal [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=996.7800000000001s)]
*  military offensive who is [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1004.62s)]
*  Relying on our money and weapons and intelligence to do this [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1007.34s)]
*  So if that's the case, like if all of that is true [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1012.3000000000001s)]
*  How can you even argue that Israel wasn't the impediment to peace this whole time? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1017.46s)]
*  You know if Hamas was willing to do this deal and this deal is a good thing and all it took was a little bit [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1022.1s)]
*  Of pressure on Israel to get them to agree to the deal and now it's gonna happen [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1027.74s)]
*  I think that pretty much answers the question about who stood in the way of peace this whole time and that [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1030.82s)]
*  Look, it's just it's interesting. It's interesting to see how this will be [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1038.18s)]
*  How this will be processed and how this will be understood [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1043.06s)]
*  particularly given the fact that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1047.1399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1050.22s)]
*  Rhetorically been so incredibly pro-israel and that so many of those really hardcore pro-israel people [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1052.5s)]
*  Supported Donald Trump enthusiastically because of that and so now if he's the one to do this it'll it'll just be interesting to see [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1060.3799999999999s)]
*  How this how everybody reacts to this? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1067.62s)]
*  I don't know any any thoughts on any of that rub [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1070.6599999999999s)]
*  I [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1073.9799999999998s)]
*  Think the Israelis went on a nice regional bombing spree under the weak Biden regime because they were able to get away with it [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1074.86s)]
*  Donald Trump was signaling in the election with his choices that he was gonna be backing them [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1083.1399999999999s)]
*  Even more than the Biden regime and that they were gonna get more of a free pass [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1089.1399999999999s)]
*  So it is interesting to see that but it might be just like what you said [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1092.6999999999998s)]
*  But it might be just like what you said Donald Trump's good with the optics and [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1096.94s)]
*  Israel might turn to bigger fights such as even Iran [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1101.14s)]
*  But at the moment, I guess no one in America likes seeing the images coming out of Gaza [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1104.6200000000001s)]
*  So could be Trump was smart enough to squash that [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1108.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think that there's [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1113.14s)]
*  There's no question right that it was [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1117.5400000000002s)]
*  For the Democrats it was a political nightmare that this was going on throughout the entire presidential election year [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1121.0600000000002s)]
*  This was just an incredible thorn in the side of Joe Biden and then ultimately Kamala Harris [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1128.5800000000002s)]
*  you know, I've talked about it a bunch on the show before but there's [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1135.38s)]
*  According to the most of the opinion polls that I've seen and this is a few months ago since I've looked at them [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1140.0600000000002s)]
*  But is about 50% of Democratic voters consider what's happening in Gaza to be a genocide [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1144.5800000000002s)]
*  Probably tank Bobby Kennedy [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1150.16s)]
*  Because he couldn't take the mantle of being the true Democrat while supporting it and [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1152.28s)]
*  100% and right it's like run the counterfactual like he he was he's the anti-war candidate [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1158.16s)]
*  Except he couldn't be the anti-war candidate anymore. So they I absolutely think it really hurt him [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1164.8s)]
*  But there's no question that this was like a huge problem for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden too [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1171.24s)]
*  You know if you've got 50% of your voting base views you as [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1176.62s)]
*  Facilitating a genocide that's not good. That's not good politics [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1183.26s)]
*  and again as I've made the case before and I really do think this is this is a I'm not saying this is like [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1187.94s)]
*  The entirety of the dynamic but it's a huge huge component of it. Is that like look where are [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1194.5s)]
*  Where are the young leftists who are outraged about Donald Trump they're silent it's I mean compared to [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1201.26s)]
*  2016 it's like night and day there are no protests against this [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1208.34s)]
*  Donald Trump getting the presidency once again and so much of that is because those young leftists have been protesting a [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1213.02s)]
*  genocide for over a year and and they [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1220.82s)]
*  It's just much more difficult to get that energy out of them to turn around and protest on behalf of the regime [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1225.46s)]
*  Facilitating the genocide that just makes it much more difficult [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1232.9s)]
*  and and there's no question in my mind that really hurt them and [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1237.18s)]
*  Despite that they were still unwilling or unable to put any pressure on Israel [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1241.9s)]
*  not just to get Israel to like stop the war but to get Israel to stop like [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1247.86s)]
*  You know being so blatant about it and and wagging but you know, I mean getting you think back to the the South African [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1253.22s)]
*  Case that they brought to the International Court of Justice and it you know [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1262.3400000000001s)]
*  It was all just Israeli leaders in their own words saying the most outrageous provocative and genocidal things [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1265.6200000000001s)]
*  It's [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1275.8200000000002s)]
*  Anyway, I guess my point is that [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1278.02s)]
*  Although it's not exactly the same dynamic it was still going to be politically damaging for Donald Trump to have this [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1280.46s)]
*  One of the things I've been thinking about a lot more [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1287.22s)]
*  Recently is like okay. What exactly is Donald Trump gonna do here and [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1290.3s)]
*  how [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1297.18s)]
*  You know, how exactly is he gonna keep this coalition together? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1298.66s)]
*  Or can he? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1303.46s)]
*  you know if Donald Trump does [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1305.18s)]
*  Look there are people like like me who [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1308.18s)]
*  as I said when I first supported Donald Trump I [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1312.22s)]
*  Supported Donald Trump because I thought he was better than Kamala Harris and it was necessary for her to lose [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1316.3799999999999s)]
*  but he [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1322.6599999999999s)]
*  Disappointed isn't even the right word [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1324.82s)]
*  But he did a lot of terrible things that I hated in his first term and as soon as he starts doing terrible things [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1326.58s)]
*  I'm gonna be criticizing him for those terrible things [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1332.98s)]
*  But I'm a little bit of a special case but even with groups like I mean [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1335.86s)]
*  I just don't see how you know if Donald Trump really wants to like [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1340.3s)]
*  govern as he campaigned if Donald Trump is gonna push us toward war with Iran or he is gonna push toward [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1345.62s)]
*  Allowing Israel to like annex the West Bank or something crazy like that if that is what ends up happening. He's gonna lose [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1352.1399999999999s)]
*  Huge portions of his base over that, you know, it's not just gonna be me there's gonna be a lot of other people [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1360.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, you know, I'm not even saying this from any private conversation or nothing like that [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1366.02s)]
*  I'm just saying this the same way [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1370.6200000000001s)]
*  I would if I didn't know any other people involved think Tucker Carlson is gonna keep supporting a guy if he's pushing for war [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1372.34s)]
*  In Iran, I don't think so. I don't see how that possibly happens [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1377.38s)]
*  And that's you're talking about the most influential right-winger besides Donald Trump in the country [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1381.58s)]
*  I think you could lose that guy's support and then of course [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1387.84s)]
*  He also has a lot of pro-israel support, you know what I mean? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1391.48s)]
*  so it's like however he plays this here and [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1394.22s)]
*  Donald Trump does have an ability to kind of do something where he could sell it to every side [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1396.8s)]
*  You know like this this could maybe be something where he like I could see this [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1403.28s)]
*  Ultimately him being able to sell this as like the pro-israel move or something like that, you know [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1409.24s)]
*  Well, you could be like look that they did what they did, you know, they took out Hamas they which isn't true [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1414.3799999999999s)]
*  But you know, you can say that they took out him. I'm sure they killed a lot of Hamas militants [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1420.28s)]
*  I'm sure in between those hospitals [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1424.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure in between those hospitals. There were some Hamas militants who got taken out [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1426.4599999999998s)]
*  And they took out no question like a huge portion of the leadership of Hezbollah [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1432.06s)]
*  They got Bashar al-Assad out of power. They completely decimated [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1437.02s)]
*  Syria's military they seized Syrian land, you know, they're [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1441.18s)]
*  You could spin this like hey you guys got a lot of what you wanted now [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1445.6200000000001s)]
*  You have to stop but that would be a way if he can ultimately bring this war to an end and not have a major [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1449.38s)]
*  escalation with Iran or with [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1456.02s)]
*  You know the West Bank or something like that. I [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1458.96s)]
*  Kind of would be a way that maybe you could keep that whole group together, you know [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1462.1000000000001s)]
*  Everyone could kind of see what they want to see in it. I don't know [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1466.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm kind of thinking out loud here, but it is possible. We'll see we'll see if he's able to do that. It's a [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1469.8s)]
*  nonetheless, it's it does it reminds me of [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1477.32s)]
*  The the Iranian hostage crisis [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1483.6s)]
*  Where they I mean I think they had actually worked out a deal like the CIA had worked out a deal [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1486.7399999999998s)]
*  To not free the hostages until Ronald Reagan came into power [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1492.6s)]
*  but it was one of those things where this was a [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1497.32s)]
*  huge scandal at the end of Jimmy Carter's presidency and then Ronald Reagan comes in and the hostages are freed and [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1500.48s)]
*  Whatever the you know, there could be some like real shady backroom deals going on here [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1507.6s)]
*  We don't know that but just speaking on the optics of it [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1512.68s)]
*  This looks so great for Donald Trump and so terrible for Joe Biden [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1516.38s)]
*  It really is like I've just never seen any election like this [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1521.0200000000002s)]
*  including 2020 and even including [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1526.7s)]
*  Like January 6th if you want to extend the election in 2020 all the way into the first week in January where you had [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1531.18s)]
*  The the Capitol riot. I don't I can't [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1538.3000000000002s)]
*  Think of another election where it's not just that the Democrats lost [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1542.26s)]
*  It's that they got [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1549.1s)]
*  obliterated at every front [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1551.1399999999999s)]
*  every front their coalition [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1553.78s)]
*  Evaporated their propaganda apparatus has been destroyed their their their number one city is on fire at the moment [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1556.86s)]
*  People like the people like Mark Zuckerberg are coming out trying to suck up to the new cool kids [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1565.22s)]
*  You know what? I mean like just being like, oh, yeah [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1570.86s)]
*  Those guys are old and lame and they suck and now you have this war which by the way had its most resistance from [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1572.46s)]
*  Democratic supporters not from Republican voters [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1579.34s)]
*  It was Democratic voters who were the biggest resistance to this war and now your rival comes in and at least has the appearance [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1581.86s)]
*  I'm not saying this is exactly what it is [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1589.14s)]
*  But has the appearance of like ending it before he even sits in the Oval Office [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1590.74s)]
*  You know, you know what? I mean like just like when you look at this on paper [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1597.58s)]
*  You're like Jesus Christ. I mean the Democrats might be the new Whig Party like they may never recover from this [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1600.4s)]
*  I mean, I I don't mean to like overstate the case here [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1606.52s)]
*  But just looking at this like the optics of it are so bad for them so bad [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1610.2800000000002s)]
*  You know if you imagine you're one of those I think it was it was over [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1616.2800000000002s)]
*  70% of Democratic voters last I looked again [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1622.52s)]
*  This is this is a few months ago and these opinion polls are never perfect [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1625.3000000000002s)]
*  But it gives you a little bit of a gauge it was over 70% of Democratic voters [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1628.48s)]
*  supported a ceasefire [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1634.52s)]
*  Okay, so they wanted this [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1636.76s)]
*  What Donald Trump just got without even having to step foot in the White House? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1639.92s)]
*  Which means what I mean what it means that Biden could have done this at any time [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1645.96s)]
*  all it would have taken as a backbone and maybe being able to complete sentences without stuttering and [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1651.08s)]
*  Needing someone to tell you where to exit from after you were done speaking, but that's I mean [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1657.56s)]
*  Just imagine like like try to think of that imagine there's a policy that 70% of your voters want and [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1664.84s)]
*  All you had to do was go and ask for it [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1673.2s)]
*  And then your opposition leader just goes and asks for it before he's even sworn in and is able to get it pretty [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1676.8s)]
*  Pretty damn incredible [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1683.6s)]
*  It's really hard again [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1685.8s)]
*  I kind of feel like as I felt when we were talking about the the fires out in California last episode [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1687.56s)]
*  it's kind of hard to overstate how bad these optics are and everything for whatever reason and [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1693.52s)]
*  You know, maybe my spidey senses should be going off. Maybe we're getting set up for something bad here, but it is unbelievable [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1700.04s)]
*  How much everything seems to just be breaking in Donald Trump's favor at least in terms of optics [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1707.4399999999998s)]
*  Like it's just like oh my god, the narrative just writes itself [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1713.82s)]
*  I mean, I can't imagine like how much fun it would be right now to be like, okay, I guess I [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1717.72s)]
*  Was gonna say a Donald Trump speechwriter, but then as I thought that in my head like I don't know if anyone else is right in those speeches [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1724.14s)]
*  Be great every time Donald Trump say every time wonderful super wonderful the most wonderful [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1730.9s)]
*  Been reading a teleprompter the whole time [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1737.3s)]
*  I [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1740.1399999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1741.78s)]
*  Tremendous is in here. Are you sure we need that many and there's just like some short Jewish guy [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1743.08s)]
*  Like now you need it. You need all the tremendous is they got a hit up [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1747.34s)]
*  But if you were like if you were like a press secretary for Donald Trump or something like that, what a fun time [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1750.4199999999998s)]
*  What are you like? Oh, dude, this is perfect. Like just sit down and spin some talking points out of this [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1756.98s)]
*  Donald Trump delivered what Joe Biden couldn't while Joe Biden was still occupying the White House [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1762.82s)]
*  And I mean, this is no, you know look again [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1769.78s)]
*  Let's just say it doesn't end the war okay, but let's let's say you just [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1775.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's say 50 hostages get back over this [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1782.3799999999999s)]
*  How is that not already a gigantic win just saved 50 human beings lives, right I mean that's [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1786.8999999999999s)]
*  Like and all it took was some pressure was going hey the next guy needs you to clean this up and I will say that [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1794.8799999999999s)]
*  You know there the comment that that Donald Trump made [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1802.32s)]
*  several months back where he said [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1807.48s)]
*  I forget exactly what he said Rob if you remember but he said like [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1811.48s)]
*  Hurry up and finish the job to Netanyahu. It was like finish the job. Gotta get it done [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1815.24s)]
*  I do think while you know, that was not exactly [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1819.96s)]
*  There was something there that kind of indicated that he's like I can't have this nuisance [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1823.44s)]
*  Once I'm president, I got enough on my plate enough. I'm trying to do [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1828.56s)]
*  I can't like this can't keep going on now Joe Biden of course had also [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=1832.16s)]

*  All right, the wig party was a political party active in the united states during the mid 19th century [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2005.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, no, I guess someone else had uh [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2011.3000000000002s)]
*  Someone else said yeah, the wig party was an old party that went extinct [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2014.18s)]
*  Um, and then the republicans came in and replaced them. But yeah, they were uh, what was it like in the in the 1850s? They were [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2018.0200000000002s)]
*  They were one of the major parties [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2025.8600000000001s)]
*  And now they're not [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2028.3400000000001s)]
*  um [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2031.3000000000002s)]
*  Do they wear wigs [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2034.66s)]
*  I don't know where the name came from maybe I think a lot of people did wear wigs back then i'm not sure but it's wig [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2036.66s)]
*  No, I think it was is w h [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2043.0600000000002s)]
*  ij [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2045.3000000000002s)]
*  so, I don't know I don't know the origin of the uh [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2046.26s)]
*  Be cool if they were the big judge ones, you know, like the curly ones the white and they all wore them [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2049.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the colonial uh, the colonial wigs [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2053.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, whenever I don't know if this is accurate or not [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2056.7400000000002s)]
*  But whenever I picture like the founders having a discussion i'm always picturing like half of them in those wigs [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2059.3s)]
*  But I don't know if that's right or not teeth [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2066.02s)]
*  Listen rob, nobody's past is perfect. Okay, but like come on the only way I can think straight is with uh, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2070.8199999999997s)]
*  Colonial wig on enslaved in my mouth enslaved. I'm sorry. Listen rob requires what he requires. Um, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2077.14s)]
*  Okay, so let's uh, let's switch gears a little bit here because I I do want to make sure we talk about this a bit [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2084.66s)]
*  one of the the [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2092.5s)]
*  The or the big story I guess from yesterday which is a little bit overshadowed by this [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2094.58s)]
*  Potential ceasefire deal being reached but yesterday all day was uh, pete hexeth's senate confirmation hearing [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2099.46s)]
*  He was the first one up. I believe christy gnome [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2106.74s)]
*  is next [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2110.9s)]
*  um, and then i'm not sure about the schedule for the rest of them, but we are [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2112.1s)]
*  confirmation season [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2118.0s)]
*  Has begun [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2120.1s)]
*  I do not know that there's [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2121.54s)]
*  ever been [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2123.7799999999997s)]
*  um [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2125.54s)]
*  A confirmation process that was quite as interesting as this [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2126.66s)]
*  Uh this one following this presidential election, um for only a few reasons or or because of a few picks [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2130.74s)]
*  um, but pete hexeth was up first, um, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2138.5s)]
*  I'm sure you saw some of it rob any thoughts on the the pete hexeth [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2142.66s)]
*  Uh confirmation hearing speaking of the christy gnome one because they always try and make people look as bad as possible [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2147.12s)]
*  So I wonder how many people are gonna ask so, uh, did you own any pets that you didn't kill? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2151.78s)]
*  I wonder that that might come up a bit, you know a bunch [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2157.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm sure it will I don't expect the christy gnome one to be quite as contentious as some others [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2162.1800000000003s)]
*  Um the pete hexeth one has been pretty contentious so far [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2169.2200000000003s)]
*  Um, what do you what do you think of how contentious it's been? How's he doing in your opinion rob? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2173.94s)]
*  well by all accounts he uh [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2179.38s)]
*  He's a smooth son of a gun. He's got the slick back hair that little grin just going [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2181.46s)]
*  I'm too handsome for you guys to get anything on me. So it seems like he dodged and weaved and handled it just fine [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2186.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh, the dumbest moment I saw and I covered this on run your mouth. I can't remember the the senator's name [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2192.5s)]
*  But one guy went on this tirade of uh, who amongst us is actually qualified for their jobs and hasn't shown up drunk for work [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2197.62s)]
*  Which I just thought was the dumbest argument for why this person should be left alone is that [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2205.06s)]
*  None of us can live by the standard of being qualified and working sober [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2209.6200000000003s)]
*  And then my other takeaway that I thought was hilarious was he had all these women who were just absolutely yelling incoherent nonsense at him [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2215.38s)]
*  Including the asian lady who might as well, uh been yelling you order now you order now [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2221.7000000000003s)]
*  So you get all these women yelling about uh, what do you mean that? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2227.6200000000003s)]
*  Do you really think that mothers shouldn't be serving in the military and it's like they're kind of proving their own point of [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2232.42s)]
*  I actually think after this conversation that women shouldn't have any jobs [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2237.62s)]
*  It I mean it really is unfortunate that if you're defending, you know, um [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2242.1s)]
*  Women in the military. This is who you have at your back further. I i've been I find the um [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2247.7000000000003s)]
*  Not that this is anything new but the the entire [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2255.78s)]
*  Um confirmation process is all just so childish and dishonest [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2259.54s)]
*  You know like it's just so first of all his pete haggseth's position on this which I don't you know even find to be [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2265.22s)]
*  a particularly controversial position this was [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2273.22s)]
*  The consensus up until five minutes ago [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2276.9799999999996s)]
*  But his position is that women shouldn't be in combat roles [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2280.58s)]
*  That's very different and you watch every one of them twist that into being women shouldn't serve in the military [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2284.3399999999997s)]
*  But he's been consistent on this that he's like no women are great jobs. All right. Yeah, there's tons of there's tons of stuff to do [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2290.74s)]
*  But I don't but you know, I mean look women [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2297.62s)]
*  being in combat [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2301.22s)]
*  always to me felt [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2303.06s)]
*  wrong [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2305.14s)]
*  and you know, I it's like [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2306.5s)]
*  for some reason we've uh gotten into this incredibly bizarre [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2309.14s)]
*  culture where that is somehow taken as being like a [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2314.98s)]
*  like a sexist statement or something like that like it's whereas like [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2321.06s)]
*  It's it's very bizarre when you think about it that it's like so the pro woman position [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2326.1s)]
*  is to throw them into [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2331.38s)]
*  Combat fighting it just doesn't I I wouldn't see if you were suggesting [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2334.1s)]
*  That you throw any of my family members into combat fighting and I was opposed to that [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2338.58s)]
*  I would not think that you were taking the pro my family position [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2344.02s)]
*  Like I would think the pro my family position would be to keep them out of combat not to put them into it [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2348.82s)]
*  But there there are these kind of you know [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2354.9s)]
*  I don't know. There's something and this is one of the worst parts about political correctness [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2359.6200000000003s)]
*  um [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2363.86s)]
*  Is that it it shuts down? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2364.9s)]
*  conversations that are often important conversations to have and it trains people to kind of um [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2367.76s)]
*  To to hear dog whistles it trains people to like hear something that they think is offensive [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2375.14s)]
*  Label you as the offensive person and then shut down whatever conversation you were having but the truth is that um [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2382.1s)]
*  Almost everybody accepts that there are to some degree gender roles between men and women and that is not [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2390.98s)]
*  that um that has to apply in [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2398.1800000000003s)]
*  arbitrary ways but [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2401.44s)]
*  To certainly I I mean look if I if any of you including you rob was one of my closest friends including you natalie [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2403.52s)]
*  including [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2411.52s)]
*  Almost almost everybody I know [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2412.7200000000003s)]
*  In fact, I think I would say everybody I know [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2415.84s)]
*  If let's just say um [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2418.64s)]
*  Someone's breaking into my house in the middle of the night and I turn over to my wife and I go [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2422.4s)]
*  All right, you got to go deal with that. I'm scared. You got to go deal with it [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2428.48s)]
*  Right [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2433.04s)]
*  Everybody I know [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2434.3999999999996s)]
*  Would never look at me the same [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2436.16s)]
*  Like you just like forever would never be able to respect me again as a man nor should you you know? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2438.24s)]
*  And you I mean like I don't know exactly what like your reaction would be but like if you try to imagine that that's real [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2444.56s)]
*  That I was just a scaredy cat and sent my wife to go handle what could be a combat situation [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2451.92s)]
*  Rather than going and doing it myself instantly [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2459.04s)]
*  Everyone loses all respect for you as a man as they should because that that's just your job [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2461.84s)]
*  That is on you as a man that's part and all men know this [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2468.56s)]
*  They they this is something that's very baked into us from a pretty young at least teenagers that it's like [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2472.7200000000003s)]
*  You got to be prepared to fight to defend the women and children around you. That's it now [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2479.76s)]
*  We live in a civilized society. You're like, hopefully maybe it doesn't come to that [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2485.6s)]
*  But if it does come to that you have to be prepared to do that [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2489.04s)]
*  And if you weren't you would be totally shamed you would lose all respect that you have from everybody [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2492.32s)]
*  I mean i'm talking about from your brother from your father from your best friend [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2498.7200000000003s)]
*  Everybody would never look at you the same. It's like okay if that's the case, which it is and I believe rightfully so [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2503.66s)]
*  Then we should be allowed to have a conversation about this [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2510.48s)]
*  What exactly is the role of women in combat and and then you know? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2513.28s)]
*  It's a whole other door that people don't like to um [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2517.68s)]
*  to examine but the [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2521.7599999999998s)]
*  Uh, the rate of sexual abuse in the military is off the charts. It is a major major problem [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2524.0s)]
*  And it's very much covered up actually [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2532.24s)]
*  Uh senator al franken of all people I believe had actually done some some good work on this [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2534.48s)]
*  And then of course he went down for posing as groping a sleeping woman's breasts [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2540.24s)]
*  Didn't really help with his whole fight against sexual assault in the military, but [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2546.32s)]
*  This is a major problem the port of how much of a turn on military gear is [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2551.04s)]
*  And why men and women need to be separated when they're wearing that kind of gear [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2555.44s)]
*  Yeah, he's like looking how distracted I am right now [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2559.12s)]
*  But you know, uh [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2564.32s)]
*  It really just it is not at least to me [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2566.88s)]
*  It's not that controversial of a of a position and this doesn't you you don't have to [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2569.92s)]
*  Um, or you can't extrapolate from that that therefore there should be gender roles in [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2575.92s)]
*  Society across the board in every role [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2581.6s)]
*  We're talking specifically about combat and I really don't think it's an unreasonable thing to say that like yeah [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2585.52s)]
*  Men should be doing our combat fighting not women [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2591.36s)]
*  Uh, that is I think his position and I think it's a pretty reasonable one [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2594.8s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is tax network usa [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2599.7599999999998s)]

*  But there's still hope tax network usa has helped taxpayers save over a billion dollars in tax debt and has filed over [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2621.68s)]
*  10 000 tax returns they specialize in helping people like you reduce their tax burden and they can help you too [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2629.02s)]

*  Smith or call 1 800 958 1000. All right, let's get back into the show [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2658.48s)]
*  Um as it is he walked that one back to say if they can pass the tests [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2664.32s)]
*  um, and even that i'm gonna say is uh [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2668.88s)]
*  Or this caught my eye because even that's a bit of a weasel move [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2672.5600000000004s)]
*  Because on the same charts where they're complaining about that women have lower standards [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2676.7200000000003s)]
*  It seemed like there were also lower standards based on what your age was [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2680.48s)]
*  So I it if anything it should just be there's one standard [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2684.32s)]
*  Which means if you're 43 and you don't have the body of a 22 year old [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2688.16s)]
*  So you can't be in the navy seals, then you can't be in the navy seals [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2692.08s)]
*  uh, so I I even thought that that was a little bit inconsistent at least based off of [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2695.7599999999998s)]
*  The criticisms I was seeing because on the same chart it seemed like there were uh, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2700.48s)]
*  lower allowances if you were older [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2704.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean look I he totally walked it back and I agree with you there [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2707.36s)]
*  There's an inconsistency there and it's like you should be more clear with your position or don't walk back your position. Um, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2711.68s)]
*  but [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2717.92s)]
*  it also does seem like [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2718.72s)]
*  you know if you want to like [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2721.12s)]
*  Is in an example like this like even as the you joked around at the beginning you see all these like clucking hens around him [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2723.68s)]
*  And you're like really you guys are supposed to be convincing us that women should you know should be in combat [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2730.3199999999997s)]
*  um, but you would think [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2735.7599999999998s)]
*  If you actually wanted to stand up for women here [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2738.0s)]
*  Well, maybe you disagree with pete haggseth you disagree with what i'm saying and you wanted to stand up [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2740.4s)]
*  Then you would think your response would be something about how actually women excel in combat [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2744.6400000000003s)]
*  And it there it doesn't you know, everyone who's looked at this can see that [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2750.0800000000004s)]
*  It's not actually a problem and it's not holding us back and it is but none of them even like came with that [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2754.0800000000004s)]
*  They all just come with this like you hate women [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2759.28s)]
*  Shit, which is just so boring and lame and i've been married to 12 of them [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2762.96s)]
*  Yeah [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2767.44s)]
*  Well, they're I mean, I guess we could touch that a little bit too. I do think [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2768.48s)]
*  I'm just here with my 14th loving wife who's here to support me [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2773.84s)]
*  Well, just isn't it so gross though the way they just bring up so much of the personal shit [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2778.16s)]
*  I mean I gotta say I really hate that and I think I think it's just wrong [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2782.2400000000002s)]
*  And I don't I [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2786.8s)]
*  I think if we were like a better society, we wouldn't do this stuff. But you know, I don't [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2788.56s)]
*  Look i'm not i'm not trying to be like judgmental of other people because it's it's easy to be judgmental [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2793.92s)]
*  um, but i'm lucky that I found my wife and you know, the I i'm [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2801.28s)]
*  Given different circumstances in life [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2806.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like I don't think i'm any better than someone who like marries the wrong person the marriage falls apart marries another person [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2809.04s)]
*  It falls apart. You know, this is just [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2815.28s)]

*  You know, I don't um [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2832.96s)]
*  I don't believe in in cheating [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2836.64s)]
*  In marriage, I have never cheated on my wife and will never cheat on my wife [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2839.84s)]
*  Um, I think it's wrong [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2843.68s)]
*  I also don't think it should be brought up publicly [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2846.16s)]
*  I just think that's that's so gross like it's not anyone's business. That's like [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2849.52s)]
*  Private now if you're alleging criminal activity, that's one thing [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2856.0s)]
*  but if you know someone was investigated and cleared of [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2860.08s)]
*  Criminal charges the idea of just bringing it up [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2865.2799999999997s)]
*  um [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2869.2s)]

*  I also do not think it's any of my business [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2901.52s)]

*  It is just all seems to me to be like way below the belt now [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=2996.96s)]
*  It's not quite as bad at least so far as like Kavanaugh territory, but it does seem to me to just be way like [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3000.48s)]
*  Below what any decent society should should tolerate and you know as I mentioned before [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3009.36s)]
*  You know back in the in the 60s [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3017.84s)]
*  This is what the media used to do [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3020.8s)]
*  They used to just not report on this stuff [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3023.0400000000004s)]
*  Like it was no the whole press corps knew that jfk was cheating all over his wife [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3025.36s)]
*  They knew martin luther king cheated on his wife [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3029.1200000000003s)]
*  They knew all of this and they didn't report it because it was seen as like beneath them [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3031.0400000000004s)]
*  Like they were supposed to be journalists. This was supposed to be a serious profession. We're asking you about [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3035.2000000000003s)]
*  Troop movements in southeast asia. You know what I mean? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3040.5600000000004s)]
*  We're not asking you about whether your wife is pissed off that you're seeing maryland monroe like that's just that that's tabloid crap [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3042.96s)]
*  And I think that's how it should be viewed [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3050.08s)]
*  That is tabloid junk it has nothing to do for it to be even mentioned at a senate confirmation hearing [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3052.08s)]
*  It just shows like how um [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3058.16s)]
*  How unserious we are as a country man not of his alcoholism, but how he's able to function so well as a drunk [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3061.28s)]
*  There you go, I think it was that you may not have that quote exactly right but it's pretty close [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3069.6s)]
*  It's pretty close to being true [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3073.52s)]
*  The story they had in the new york times I I might not have this right [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3076.24s)]
*  I covered it months ago and run your mouth [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3079.3599999999997s)]
*  But the big scandalous story to showcase his alcoholism was that he had to go home like early from a wedding [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3080.64s)]
*  And they had to send a car team to pick him up for work the next morning [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3086.64s)]
*  And i'm like wait so the guy still showed up to work like it couldn't have been that bad [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3089.6s)]
*  Just sounds like a guy at a wedding like what what is this? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3093.68s)]
*  How is this newsworthy? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3096.8s)]
*  That's the thing about it is that it leaves you no sense of like [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3098.8s)]
*  What exactly happened? You know like it's like because this could be this could be a story [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3102.96s)]
*  That's like, you know, this guy was [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3108.88s)]
*  Blastered and embarrassing himself and screaming and he had to be restrained and had to be taken back [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3111.5s)]
*  Or it could be a story of like he had three whiskies and hadn't eaten yet and he went like, uh, dude [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3117.6000000000004s)]
*  This like hit me a little too hard i'm gonna have to get out of here [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3124.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like it's like which one is it we we don't know and either way [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3126.7200000000003s)]
*  It has nothing to do with whether he should be the defense secretary or not [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3130.32s)]
*  and and especially especially [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3134.48s)]
*  given [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3137.6800000000003s)]
*  the state of the world [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3138.88s)]
*  Where the the are these these two? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3141.28s)]
*  crazy volatile wars going on one with a nuclear superpower [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3144.64s)]
*  you know like and and america is [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3150.56s)]
*  Deeply involved in both of them. In fact, you could really argue that we are the other side, right? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3153.92s)]
*  Because ukraine is not fighting this war without our support for all this time [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3160.7999999999997s)]
*  And israel is not fighting this war without our support like we are the deciding factors in this [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3165.04s)]
*  I mean there might be there are wars where other [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3170.16s)]
*  Forces get involved but it's not always so black and white that like this war would not be happening if it wasn't for this [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3173.7599999999998s)]
*  so [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3180.96s)]
*  You know [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3181.92s)]
*  France might be sending some weapons to you to ukraine [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3183.04s)]
*  But if france stops sending all the weapons they're sending or the money they're sending ukraine's still going to be fighting this war [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3187.12s)]
*  But that's not true for the u.s [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3193.44s)]
*  Like they would not be fighting it without us. And so like anyway, my point is just like I think there's enough just in terms of policy [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3195.6800000000003s)]
*  Maybe the confirmation hearing should just focus on that [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3203.92s)]
*  Where are you on these issues? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3206.96s)]
*  Maybe that should be what you judge, uh, uh [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3209.2000000000003s)]
*  potential defense secretary [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3212.56s)]

*  But prolon is a revolutionary plant-based nutrition program that nourishes the body while making cells believe they are fasting [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3259.04s)]

*  Let's uh, there was this one [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3309.68s)]
*  Moment that the internet is getting quite a kick out of with, uh, elizabeth warren [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3311.9199999999996s)]
*  Um, which actually was kind of an interesting moment. Let's let's play that video clip real quick [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3316.64s)]
*  You're quite sure [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3322.7999999999997s)]
*  That every general who serves should not go directly into the defense industry for 10 years [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3324.96s)]
*  You're not willing to make that same pledge [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3331.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not a general senator [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3334.7999999999997s)]
*  You'll be the one [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3338.72s)]
*  Let us just be clear in charge of the generals. You're quite sure [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3340.56s)]
*  All right. So that was the the line and pete hagseth supporters on on twitter are uh [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3346.24s)]
*  Couting this as pete hagseth dunking on elizabeth warren and making her look, uh foolish to the entire room [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3352.88s)]
*  I don't know that i'm agreeing with that [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3360.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, you know, this is actually a in my opinion a pretty reasonable demand by elizabeth warren [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3362.96s)]
*  and personally [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3370.48s)]
*  i'd like to see [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3372.08s)]
*  Um, I mean i'd like to see legislation passed that would [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3373.52s)]
*  Enforce this but I I certainly think like I don't know why [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3377.12s)]
*  It's unreasonable to demand of all of our uh, our public servants [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3381.44s)]
*  that [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3387.28s)]
*  You shouldn't be able to get rich off of these positions, you know [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3388.4s)]
*  I mean there is no question we talk about it all the time on this show rob [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3392.56s)]
*  You you always bring this up, but there is no question that like we all know there's this huge [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3396.56s)]
*  Revolving door game that goes on where people who do the bidding of the regime [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3402.7799999999997s)]
*  Are made rich for doing the bidding of the regime and I don't understand exactly why we shouldn't all oppose that [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3409.7599999999998s)]
*  And I mean all oppose that like no matter what your politics are [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3417.2s)]
*  I don't care if you're a left winger or a right winger or a libertarian or a classical liberal or anything else a progressive a socialist [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3421.2s)]
*  A nazi or whatever whatever, you know [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3427.68s)]
*  Ideology you can think of I don't see why anyone should believe that you can get rich [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3431.5s)]
*  off of [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3439.52s)]
*  Essentially doing the bidding of powerful interests with taxpayer money. This is ridiculous [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3441.58s)]
*  You know, you'd be nicky haley who's like an ambassador to the un [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3446.96s)]
*  As [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3451.6s)]
*  Is worth next to nothing and then all of a sudden she's on the boards of these weapons companies and she's making millions of dollars [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3452.8s)]
*  Who can support that? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3460.16s)]
*  And I don't think it's unreasonable for elizabeth warren to be like hey [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3461.92s)]
*  Pete you said none of the generals should be able to go make money, uh off of their their military service [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3466.0s)]
*  How about you too? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3472.48s)]
*  I don't know. What do you think rob? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3474.7200000000003s)]
*  Works for me. I actually I mean elizabeth elizabeth warren is a terrible on nearly every issue [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3477.68s)]
*  uh, but when it comes to uh [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3483.52s)]
*  The revolving door of government particularly in the financial sector and I guess here in the military industrial, uh sector [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3485.8399999999997s)]
*  She's spot on but the same issue exists in uh, the pharmaceutical sector [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3492.56s)]
*  The the old head of the fba should not be the on the board of pfizer now [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3496.8799999999997s)]
*  Um, it's it's across the board and I I mean the argument typically is that um, these people are the most qualified [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3501.2s)]
*  So like, you know if you've right risen to be the head of gullman sax [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3508.4s)]
*  You understand the financial market's the best and that's why it makes sense for you to maybe have the position at the treasury [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3512.08s)]
*  um, right, but I [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3518.0s)]
*  they got to work out some sort of a mechanism where you don't get to also just you know, make sure that the um [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3520.16s)]
*  That the bailouts are going to your industry that only your pharmaceutical companies are actually being your products are being reviewed or pushed through or [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3527.6800000000003s)]
*  Because you have the uh patent on them. You want to see legislation that ensures that every single person in america has to take it [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3535.2000000000003s)]
*  um, so yeah, this is this is a problem across the board and that was a [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3543.44s)]
*  I'm surprised that the room laughed and got pete hexes back on that because uh, she was making a broader point of [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3547.6000000000004s)]
*  Will you commit to not taking part in this revolving door and going from your post to then being in the military industrial complex? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3554.16s)]
*  And he took a weasely technical answer. Well, that's a general I wouldn't be a general but it's the same [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3562.3199999999997s)]
*  It's the same question and that was a weasely answer [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3567.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the you know to your point [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3571.2s)]
*  It's like look I could totally see if there's an answer if there's a situation [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3574.3199999999997s)]
*  Where somebody has been wildly successful in the private sector? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3580.3199999999997s)]
*  And so they've made a ton of money and then you're trying to get that person to do some role in government [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3585.8399999999997s)]
*  And someone was going like well, I don't want a person who's made all this money in this sector [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3591.2799999999997s)]
*  You know being in charge of the government. Okay, there's a little bit of a point there [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3595.2799999999997s)]
*  But I could certainly see a counter argument where somebody would be like, uh, that's because they're the best in this field [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3598.24s)]
*  That's why they've been so successful. That's why they should come here, but we're not talking about that [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3603.52s)]
*  We're talking about people who aren't rich and successful in their field [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3607.2799999999997s)]
*  Leveraging a position within the government to then go get rich and I don't think you know [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3610.8599999999997s)]
*  Pete hegseth was a fox news host for many years [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3617.68s)]
*  I'm sure he made very good money off of that, but I don't think it's that unreasonable to go like [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3620.48s)]
*  well [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3626.24s)]
*  If your goal is to go make money in this industry, then you're free to go do that [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3627.44s)]
*  but if you want to come be the defense secretary, then you have to um, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3631.68s)]
*  You know [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3637.12s)]
*  You have to promise or you have to be forced potentially by law that um [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3638.4s)]
*  You're not allowed to trade that power that you have for future personal profits. It's really that simple [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3643.52s)]
*  I mean, it's like there's you know, when you it's a real problem that we have [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3649.6s)]
*  The ultimate solution to it should be that government shouldn't be so powerful [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3653.8399999999997s)]
*  um, but [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3658.56s)]
*  While it is that powerful when when you're in a position [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3660.48s)]
*  Especially a position with a lot of power like defense secretary [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3664.64s)]
*  You are now [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3669.2799999999997s)]
*  moving mountains [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3671.52s)]
*  economically [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3673.5s)]
*  Okay, and and whether or not you want to think about that? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3674.4799999999996s)]
*  That's just the fact if you decide we're gonna you know, if okay, obviously only the president [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3677.7599999999998s)]
*  You know congress is supposed to declare the laws but in real life the president does [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3683.6s)]
*  um [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3688.3999999999996s)]
*  but [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3689.52s)]
*  The defense secretary sure has a whole lot of influence and power [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3690.8s)]
*  And you're going to be making decisions that are going to make certain companies filthy rich make other nations dirt poor [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3694.88s)]
*  You're making you know, and whenever you have that much power [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3701.76s)]
*  The people who you're making filthy rich are going to be incentivized to want to [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3705.36s)]
*  Make sure you do that [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3713.52s)]
*  And this is one of the ways in which they do that and there's just no question about it that like [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3715.36s)]
*  whether it's [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3720.0s)]
*  Making huge speaking fees whether it's being put on boards and making uh enormous salaries [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3721.36s)]
*  Whether it's getting a book publishing deals where huge checks are cut [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3727.2799999999997s)]
*  There are all types of ways of paying people off after the fact and it's a major problem. It should stop [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3731.36s)]
*  I have no problem with this. Uh, this question from elizabeth warren. Um, all right, we got to wrap up here [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3737.68s)]
*  But I do want to say [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3743.8399999999997s)]
*  you know [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3746.16s)]
*  Hag seph to me is really not the most interesting confirmation [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3748.72s)]
*  Um, he is an interesting one, but I am really really interested to see um, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3753.92s)]
*  Tulsi bobby kennedy jay badacharya. Did you hear the tulsa story? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3760.46s)]
*  Uh her flip-flop on uh, 702. Yeah. Um, yeah, you know i'm trying not to um, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3766.16s)]
*  I'm trying my best to kind of reserve judgment [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3772.7999999999997s)]
*  At least for now on it [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3776.16s)]
*  um, but there's no question that [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3778.24s)]
*  Tulsi is you know, at least signaled that she's going to be flip-flopping [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3781.52s)]
*  on um on fed spying [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3786.7999999999997s)]
*  Look [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3791.2s)]
*  I don't even know what to say. Look dc has a way of uh changing people and not for the better, right? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3793.2s)]
*  You think about some of the stuff mike johnson had said about um [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3798.7999999999997s)]
*  Federal spying and also about the war in ukraine before he was speaker and then he becomes speaker and all of a sudden [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3802.88s)]
*  He's singing a different tune and a big part of that is because like well [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3808.4s)]
*  You're just not gonna be speaker if you're still saying that and I think [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3810.88s)]
*  it's been stated I think openly by [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3816.24s)]
*  At least one senator, but I could be wrong [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3820.4s)]
*  It could be more than that [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3823.7599999999998s)]
*  But it's been stated they straight up will not vote for tulsi gabbert unless she changes her view on [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3824.72s)]
*  Uh, you know government spying fiza court stuff like that [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3831.12s)]
*  If that's the case, okay [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3836.8799999999997s)]
*  And i'm trying to hedge my bets here because i'm really I am waiting to reserve judgment if that's the case [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3838.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm not so sure that like if I were tulsi gabbert's close personal confidant. I might be like hey just lie [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3844.3999999999996s)]
*  Say what you need to say and get in there and then do what you were always trying to do [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3852.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that's the case [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3856.56s)]
*  It's much more likely that the case is that people once they get in these positions of power tend to be corrupted [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3858.56s)]
*  um [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3865.2s)]
*  But i'll reserve judgment on that until we hear more from her at her confirmation hearings [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3866.16s)]
*  And then ultimately assuming she's confirmed to see what she actually does when she's in there [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3870.9599999999996s)]
*  But yeah, that's things like this are typically what end up happening [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3874.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's why her confirmation hearing and bobby's and jay badacharya's are all going to be very very interesting [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3879.04s)]
*  Very interesting. Um, all right, we got to wrap up on that comic dave smith.com come see us in bozeman montana [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3884.56s)]
*  That is just a few days away [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3893.12s)]
*  And then of course, uh louisville and fort wayne coming up the following week comic dave smith.com rob [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDs6BBwzUQ&t=3895.36s)]
