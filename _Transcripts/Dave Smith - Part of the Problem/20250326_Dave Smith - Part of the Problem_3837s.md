# Dave Smith | Waltz Is Lying | Part Of The Problem 1247
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4)
*  What's up? What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. I am rolling solo for this episode. And Rob and me, we tomorrow morning, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=11.8s)]
*  I'm jumping on a plane to Boston. So come on out. There are still limited tickets available. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=20.28s)]
*  They're selling very quick. If you want to come out, we got a show tomorrow night, then [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=26.72s)]
*  two shows, Friday, two shows, Saturday at laugh, Boston comic, davesmith.com. That is [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=30.24s)]
*  the website where you can grab all the ticket links and, and plus everything. I think we [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=36.16s)]
*  got dates on there like going through the rest of the year. So me and Rob are traveling [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=41.36s)]
*  quite a bit doing standup shows this year. I will be, I'm about to enter a tornado of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  travel over the next few weeks, a few big podcasts and some standup shows, stand up. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  I'll be doing standup in Boston and Nashville. And then in between that, I got some other [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=57.76s)]
*  traveling too. So again, comic davesmith.com hope to see some of you guys out there on the road. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=62.16s)]
*  Really looking forward to Boston because I always love performing there. All right. By the way, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=68.16s)]
*  before we get into the show today, I do, I did notice I was just looking at Twitter as I was [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=72.32s)]
*  preparing for the show and I seem to have struck a nerve with some people based on some comments [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=78.4s)]
*  I made on the last podcast about emojis and people are upset. I, people who love their emojis [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  really, really love them, but I'm sorry. They're for women and children. And I stand by it. I have, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=92.72s)]
*  I'm pretty old school or maybe I'm just old, but things that were not done in my time make me [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  uncomfortable and I don't care to adjust. And I don't think that's the role that I don't think [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=108.08s)]
*  that's what men are supposed to do. We're not supposed to adjust to the new time. We're supposed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=113.6s)]
*  to stay locked in our time. And I try my best to do that. I also, by the way, I have a lot of strict [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=118.08s)]
*  views on this stuff. I've upset people with this before. In fact, it was David cross who, I mean, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=124.24s)]
*  he was mad because I humiliated him in that debate we did years ago, but he got very offended. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=129.6s)]
*  When I said that I don't think men should have holidays that I think like I was ripping on [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=135.44s)]
*  father's day, father's day is pointless. It shouldn't exist. Holidays are not for men. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=141.44s)]
*  I don't think men should even celebrate their birthdays past a certain age. Like what I think [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=147.28s)]
*  you, like I did a thing, I had a thing for my 40th birthday and my wife kind of insisted, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=154.48s)]
*  she twisted my arm into doing it, but I had a party for my 40th birthday. I think that maybe [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=159.68s)]
*  is appropriate for men. You're like every decade, your 40th, your 50th, your 60th. Okay, fine. You [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=164.8s)]
*  could have a little party, but like father's day, first off father's day is never a thing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  It's never, no dad has ever enjoyed father's day. We don't care. You're just buying us crap with our [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=176.32s)]
*  money, which is not, that doesn't make sense. It also doesn't, it doesn't make sense to give [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=182.96s)]
*  a gift if you're spending it in the other person's money, just let them get what they want for [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=188.48s)]
*  themselves. Also dads, like when you're a grown man, you don't every, I appreciate every day that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  I get to spend with my family, but I don't need it to be a day of celebration about me because just [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=199.44s)]
*  think about that. A day of celebration. That's not for men. A day of celebration is for women [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=204.32s)]
*  and children. So anyway, I'm not backing off of my, my emoji position and I will double down on [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=210.56s)]
*  this. I will go, I will die on this hell. I'll go all the way. Someone told me on Twitter, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=216.08s)]
*  I shouldn't die on this hell. You don't get to pick what hills I die on. I do. And it's this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  anti emoji. It's not good for society when men are communicating with emojis that someone else [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  said to me, they go, well, how else are you supposed to convey emotion in a tweet? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=233.28s)]
*  Does that just prove my point right there? Yeah. You're not supposed to convey emotion. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=240.56s)]
*  That's the whole point. Okay. Anyway, enough silliness. So for today's episode, I got it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=244.32s)]
*  We're just going to talk more about the signal stuff because more has come out about it. And [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  it's, it's fascinating. And it's, I just find it interesting to cover the fallout of all of this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  Now I'm not, I'm as, as I said yesterday on the show, I'm not presenting this with like any type [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=263.76s)]
*  of like unified theory of, okay, here's what happened. This isn't something like, like Russia [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=271.52s)]
*  gate where, you know, after, you know, covering it for a long period of time, and then a lot of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=278.56s)]
*  information came out and there's just been, there's been declassified information. There was the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=283.76s)]
*  Mueller report. There was the Durham report that, that investigated the investigation. So there's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  a lot there where you could be like, okay, here's the cohesive narrative. Okay. Hillary Clinton went [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  to this British spy who went to this Russian spy who compiled this dossier of pure lies and garbage. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=298.48s)]
*  They knew it was pure lies and garbage. Then the, you know what I mean? After Donald Trump wins the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=305.36s)]
*  election, the FBI and the CIA use it to launch this big investigation into Donald Trump. Okay. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=310.0s)]
*  We don't have anything like that here yet. What we do have is, okay, you have a scandal. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=316.72s)]
*  As I said yesterday on the show, the major scandal here is not what's being covered. You know, it's, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=324.88s)]
*  I was thinking about this last night, but there were two, two examples that just pop into my head [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=332.32s)]
*  that kind of remind me of this signal thing. And the two examples were number one was Ben Ghazi. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=339.6s)]
*  And number two was the F the EU, Victoria Newland phone call that leaked. So real quickly for [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=348.88s)]
*  anybody who doesn't know the story, Benghazi, if you were paying attention to the news back then, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=357.92s)]
*  this was in, in Barack Obama's first term, this was like one of his scandals. Fox news talked [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=365.2s)]
*  about it all the time. The Mitt Romney brought it up a lot when he was running against Obama in [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  2012. And essentially what was amazing about it for anybody who followed it was that they made [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=381.52s)]
*  the whole scandal that this U S embassy in Benghazi was overrun. And I mean, Hillary Clinton [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=388.32s)]
*  testified for hours. I think she did like a six hour congressional testimony on this. And it was [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  just constant, you know, the parameters of the conversation were like so narrowed. It was, you [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=403.68s)]
*  know, this is really back when, you know, CNN and MSNBC and Fox news really controlled a lot more of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=408.88s)]
*  the narrative. In fact, this is, again, I might be dating myself here, but Fox news was so big at one [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=415.36s)]
*  point and so like involved in this conversation that if you, I'm somebody who's certainly [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=422.64s)]
*  experienced this and people around my age with around my politics probably did too. But if you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=429.36s)]
*  back in the Obama days were like critical of liberals at all, the first things people would [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=435.44s)]
*  say back to you was like, Oh, what are you watching too much Fox news? That was always just like the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=442.56s)]
*  assumption. It was like, Oh, if you're, if you're not a liberal, well, then obviously you watch Fox [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=448.16s)]
*  news. And then I would tell people like, no, I hate Fox news too. And that would, they would not [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  understand that. And it was in this, in a similar sense to like, if you, you know, if you were [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=458.64s)]
*  saying nine 11 was an inside job or something like that, people would have been like, Oh, what are [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=465.28s)]
*  you watching Alex Jones? It was just like thought of as the way Alex Jones owned the conspiracy [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=468.56s)]
*  world. Fox news owned the I'm not a liberal world. And today that's totally different. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=473.84s)]
*  That's just today. If you were critical of liberals, people are probably assuming that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=481.84s)]
*  you're listening to podcasts or that you're there's an influencer, you know, like maybe they'd, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=486.64s)]
*  they'd assume you're like, I don't know. I don't even know who the person would be, but because [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=491.52s)]
*  it could be so many people, it could be anyone from Ben Shapiro to Andrew Tate to whoever, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=495.44s)]
*  you know, it's a different world, much more decentralized. Back then, they really controlled [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=500.56s)]
*  the narrative. And so the whole conversation was over how Obama was so weak that he couldn't [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  protect this ambassador. Obama was so weak that he couldn't protect this embassy. And the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=512.24s)]
*  Republicans were tough and strong and they were going to get to the bottom of what happened. And [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=517.36s)]
*  through this whole thing, almost nobody raises the question. Why was our CIA embedded in Libya? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=521.28s)]
*  What was going on here? And like, and the actual story was that Obama had decided along with [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=530.4s)]
*  a NATO to overthrow the Gaddafi regime in Libya, which that in itself would, you would have thought [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=539.76s)]
*  even by this time, I mean, what are we talking about? 2011 here, even by this time, this is, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=548.64s)]
*  you know, eight years after we overthrew Saddam Hussein in Iraq and eight years after or nine, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=555.28s)]
*  sorry, 10 years after we began the regime change war in Afghanistan. And these wars were already [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=563.12s)]
*  disasters. So the idea of doing like another regime change would have been probably a bit [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=571.44s)]
*  of a scandal. But they were really somewhat remarkably able to get you to like not focus [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=576.32s)]
*  on that story and just focus on this very narrow area of like, who could have protected the embassy [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=582.1600000000001s)]
*  better? The other example is the Victoria Newland F the EU phone call. So for people who don't know [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=589.04s)]
*  about this, this was, I believe, maybe just, you know, we don't know exactly when the phone call [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  took place, but it was the phone call was leaked, like, I believe a couple weeks before the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=605.04s)]
*  Yanukovych government was overthrown in Ukraine. And the it was presumably leaked by the Russians. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=612.48s)]
*  I don't know that that's ever actually been proven for sure. But there is a conversation [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  between Jeffrey Piot and Victoria Newland. And it was essentially as this as this coup that the US [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  is backing was overthrowing the Yanukovych government, or I should say, as the as the street [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=634.16s)]
*  protests that the US government was backing was gaining more and more traction. They were there's [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=640.56s)]
*  this phone call of the ambassador and Victoria Newland at the State Department talking about [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=647.5999999999999s)]
*  who is to be in the new government, and who's not to be in the new government, by the way, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=654.7199999999999s)]
*  very coincidentally, they got all of their picks. It's exactly how the new government ended up being [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=660.2399999999999s)]
*  made up. And so here you have, you know, Victoria Newland, who is the wife of Robert Kagan, these [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=665.76s)]
*  are like real deal, like true neocons, okay, orchestrating a regime change, deciding who's [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=673.6s)]
*  going to go in the new government and who's not going to go in the new government. And also, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  pretty clearly alluding to the whole operation that's going on. I mean, they they open it up, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=687.04s)]
*  the terminology that they use is very spy like stuff, you know, they're like, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=692.16s)]
*  we got to glue this thing, we got to stick it. We got to, she goes, we need a midwife, this thing, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=697.12s)]
*  at one point, they say, anyway, so through this whole thing, she even at one point says, because [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=704.0s)]
*  this is under the Obama administration, at one point, she even says that we're she goes, I talked [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=709.04s)]
*  to Joe Biden to the vice president, he's going to get on the phone to give them an attaboy, like the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=714.16s)]
*  vice president will get on the phone to tell them we got your back, good job. And then at one point, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=719.28s)]
*  she's bitching about the EU and how the EU is just moving too slowly to, you know, whatever, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=725.04s)]
*  force Yonikovych out. And so at one point in her frustration, she goes, she was basically like, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=735.68s)]
*  you know what, we'll do it without them. We'll do this thing without the EU. And you know what, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=742.16s)]
*  F the EU, we'll do it ourselves. And then somehow this gets leaked. And then in the entire media, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=746.4s)]
*  through the entire coverage of this was that we had a diplomat on the phone with a representative [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=755.28s)]
*  in the state department, and they said F the EU. And that's really undiplomatic when you think [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  about it. And so like that became the whole conversation. But bury the context of any of it, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=770.48s)]
*  like the actual really interesting scandal there is that there's some clear evidence here that the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=777.44s)]
*  US is involved in this overthrow of a democratically elected government in Ukraine, you know, which, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=784.24s)]
*  okay, at the time, like the war hadn't broken out yet, but you can still see where that would be kind [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=791.6s)]
*  of scandalous, you know, but that does not. And it's just, I just couldn't help but see these [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=795.12s)]
*  parallels as I'm reading the news coverage of this signal leak. And what is it that they're [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=800.16s)]
*  jumping on? Like, it's so funny, because I never would have even thought of this as being the thing [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=805.76s)]
*  we read it yesterday on the show. And it didn't even jump out to me as like even a scam. But the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=811.28s)]
*  thing is that this is what they're running with at CNN and stuff like that is that I guess Pete [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=815.76s)]
*  Hegseth and JD Vance were trash in Europe. And that Pete Hegseth called Europe pathetic. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=821.92s)]
*  That really is some way to speak about our allies. So now you see what they're doing here, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=830.56s)]
*  Like they always try to focus on one salacious detail so that you can drive all the outrage about [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=836.8s)]
*  that. You can signal to all the Trump haters, hey, if you want to find a scandal here, we'll hear [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=847.04s)]
*  it. This is your thing to focus on. The thing to focus on is that the defense secretary called our [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=853.36s)]
*  European allies pathetic. Rather than the obvious scandal that's right in front of you, which is [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=858.64s)]
*  that America could never not be fighting a fucking war. No matter what, even when you vote for [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=866.7199999999999s)]
*  the Nobel Peace Prize winning Barack Obama, he's in wars immediately. When you vote for the America [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=875.28s)]
*  first, we want to get out of all these wars, Donald Trump, immediately we're bombing the poorest [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=881.36s)]
*  country in the Middle East. Just like that is so obviously the scandal here. But everyone's finding [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=886.0799999999999s)]
*  everything else that they can to focus on. Now, I will say, and again, as I alluded to earlier, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=892.8s)]
*  I'm not claiming to have like a flushed out, worked out version of what the bigger picture is [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=901.76s)]
*  here. I'm not claiming that. I will say that having that flushed out bigger picture of what [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=907.52s)]
*  happened in the first four years of Donald Trump's administration, I do think it's reasonable [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=914.3199999999999s)]
*  to kind of speculate. I mean, I think it's reasonable when you know, like if Donald Trump's, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=921.68s)]
*  if we didn't know everything we knew about Donald Trump's first administration, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=931.36s)]
*  it would probably be a little bit more of a leap to think this way. But knowing what we knew then, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=936.96s)]
*  I think it's very reasonable to ask ourselves whether Donald Trump is being sabotaged here or [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=944.16s)]
*  not. Now, I'm just throwing that out there. And I'm, this is one of the possibilities that I'm [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=951.52s)]
*  considering because what we have here is an official story that makes absolutely no sense. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=958.88s)]
*  And we'll get into this in a little bit. But I just want to be clear. I am not, if I'm, if the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=963.12s)]
*  claim is that Donald Trump has people around him who are sabotaging the Trump administration, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=970.96s)]
*  I just want to be very clear that that is in no way letting Donald Trump off the hook. Like, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=979.2s)]
*  he's still responsible. Like this is, this is his job. Listen, I mean, he was, he was the [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=985.9200000000001s)]
*  president of the United States for four years. I mean, he decided to run for president in 2016. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=993.44s)]
*  I think the reasonable expectation is that by the time you decide to run for president, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=998.32s)]
*  you know, a thing or two about a thing or two. Otherwise, why the hell would you even be running [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1002.32s)]
*  for president? You must have some ideas and some knowledge and some reason to believe that you can [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1006.32s)]
*  execute these ideas. But then he had four years in there, a real trial by fire, and then had another [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1011.36s)]
*  four year period with nothing else that he had to do except fight legal cases. But getting ready for [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1019.76s)]
*  his, for running again. And I don't think it's too much to expect that by the time you get there, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1027.04s)]
*  this is eight years later from when you already were running for president, that you know who to [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1033.84s)]
*  pick as your national security advisor. And I, it's just, I can't tell you how many good people [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1038.16s)]
*  there are. I'm certainly not like the one there's a lot who would have known that Mike was a terrible [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1044.88s)]
*  pick for national security advisor. Now, of course we did say that on this show as he was picking him. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1053.2s)]
*  But that's, you know, we're far from the only ones who knew this. The guy's just a terrible guy to [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1059.6000000000001s)]
*  pick. And look, if you know, by the way, Donald Trump did just order all of the FBI to declassify [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1065.12s)]
*  all of the documents dealing with the investigation into Trump, the Russiagate investigation in the [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1073.9199999999998s)]
*  first four years. We'll see what comes out over that. But if you know that Donald Trump not only [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1080.9599999999998s)]
*  was, I mean, look, I'm not overstating it. Not only was he framed for treason by his own intelligence [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1086.1599999999999s)]
*  agencies in his first administration, but there were undeniably countless people within Donald [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1093.04s)]
*  Trump's administration who were working against him. Now this was, this is a objective fact at [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1102.08s)]
*  this point. And not just like, not just, I'm not just talking about the like how every single week [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1110.08s)]
*  in the New York Times, there would be, you know, unnamed sources from the executive branch who were [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1116.96s)]
*  saying something to damage Donald Trump. But I mean, like at the top levels of his cabinet, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1123.52s)]
*  he had his own people working against him, not just his own intelligence agencies, but the people [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1128.08s)]
*  he put around him. So number one, I don't think it's unreasonable to speculate that maybe that's [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1132.72s)]
*  the case again. And number two, it's Donald Trump's fault. If that's the case again, just want to be [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1139.3600000000001s)]
*  very clear on that. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1145.76s)]

*  the shelves at the grocery store. Don't be caught in that situation. If there's one thing you want [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1155.12s)]
*  to know, it's that in the next emergency, you and your family will be taken care of. And the most [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1160.48s)]
*  important thing is making sure you have food. That's why I trust MyPatriot Supply to help prepare [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1165.92s)]

*  Each of these kits offers over 2,000 calories per day of delicious, easy-to-prepare meals that last [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1184.8s)]

*  just knowing you're covered. Stock up today before this deal disappears because when an emergency hits, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1197.12s)]

*  into the show. The other thing to mention here is that Mike Waltz, first of all, and I know a little [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1215.4399999999998s)]
*  bit of this stuff because I've heard stories behind the scenes. I mean, I just know enough [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1221.52s)]
*  about the guy to know he was terrible from the beginning, but he is like totally just the worst [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1224.88s)]
*  on foreign policy. He doesn't know what he's talking about. He's the type of guy who would [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1230.4s)]
*  say something like, if Vladimir Putin succeeds in Ukraine, he's going to move on Poland next. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1235.5200000000002s)]
*  That's who you're dealing with here. Also, he worked for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1241.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm just saying I don't, I don't think it's unreasonable at this point to be suspicious of [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1246.8000000000002s)]
*  people like that. These are the guys who have been consistently undermining Donald Trump the whole [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1255.8400000000001s)]
*  time. In fact, what was his, hold on, I'll pull it up right here. I have a, he was, yeah. So he was a, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1262.24s)]
*  he was a special forces guy. Again, not saying that alone, you know, this credits you, but it [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1270.72s)]
*  raises an eyebrow. He served the Bush administration as a defense policy director in the Pentagon [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1277.76s)]
*  and as the counterterrorism advisor to vice president Dick Cheney. Okay. Now, so anyway, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1284.8s)]
*  to, I just think essentially my point is here to suspect that the counterterrorism advisor to Dick [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1292.48s)]
*  Cheney is going to be loyal to Donald Trump is perhaps an unreasonable expectation. It's perhaps [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1302.24s)]
*  reasonable to speculate that maybe that guy wouldn't be loyal to Donald Trump. And then [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  my more important point that's on Donald Trump. That's not, I have never been one, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1316.8000000000002s)]
*  although I did support Donald Trump in this last election, I have never been one to make the [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1324.0s)]
*  bullshit excuses for him that I see so many of the Trump supporters making like, Oh, he was tricked [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  by his guy. Like, Oh, okay. Donald Trump got to choose who his national security advisor were. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1334.72s)]
*  And there's plenty of great people he could have picked from. And he chose [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1339.68s)]
*  Dick Cheney's counterterrorism guy. I'm sorry, but that, first of all, that already, even if none of [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1344.08s)]
*  this is true, even if walls just fucked up and he's not trying to sabotage the whole thing, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1352.56s)]
*  and there's no conspiracy here whatsoever, it's still really says something about Donald Trump's [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1357.12s)]
*  profound lack of judgment to have picked this guy. And it says something about all the people [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1362.7199999999998s)]
*  around Donald Trump, every, I mean, you would just think after everything, after everything, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1368.56s)]
*  the country's been through everything, Donald Trump's been through all the time. He's had to [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1375.2s)]
*  learn this. You would just think that like, if somebody ever suggested, Hey, you know, we're, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1380.56s)]
*  we're thinking about, you know, your next national security advisor, and we have all these great [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1386.72s)]
*  options. I'm thinking Dick Cheney's counterterrorism advisor. You would think number one, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1391.52s)]
*  Donald Trump would probably fire you for suggesting that. And number two, that it would never even get [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1400.24s)]
*  to Donald Trump because every single person around him would be like, what? No, we're not doing that [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1405.2s)]
*  anymore. That's, that's not what we're doing. We're not doing that. We're doing an America first [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1410.08s)]
*  thing here. And so it tells you something that none of that happened. It tells you, not only did [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1414.16s)]
*  none of that happen, the guy ends up getting the job, not just getting considered for it. He gets [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1419.76s)]
*  the job. Okay. So in the wake of everything that we talked about on the last episode and the stuff [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1424.0s)]
*  I've been alluding to here last night, Mike Waltz, the national security advisor, who is responsible [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1431.04s)]
*  for this humiliating debacle. He went on the Laura Ingram show to defend himself. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1439.76s)]
*  Now it should be mentioned before we play this, that Donald Trump has also gone out of his way to [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1449.6s)]
*  defend him too, and say that their team's doing a great job. And, you know, I think [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1455.6799999999998s)]
*  I, my, my feel of the situation is that essentially Donald Trump's in a position where [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1462.32s)]
*  he's riding pretty high politically right now. If you go again, if you look at the, the, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1469.6799999999998s)]
*  his approval rating, it's, it's been about the highest he's ever had pretty consistently in that [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1477.2s)]
*  range. It's been about from 47 to 53% kind of depending on what poll you look at that in itself [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1483.92s)]
*  wouldn't seem so great. I mean, it's pretty good for America today with how divided politically [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1491.28s)]
*  we are. That's about as popular as a president can get. And obviously he's more popular than he ever [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1497.92s)]
*  was in his first term. So in that sense, it's a win, but really it's when you kind of look at [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1503.12s)]
*  more numbers and you, you know, you dive into the context a little bit more that, like the, the right [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  track, wrong track number is like, I think it's like right around 50% of, of Americans right now [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1515.9199999999998s)]
*  say we're on the right track. And it was in the twenties when Joe Biden was president. So again, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1522.8799999999999s)]
*  just this 47 to 53% may not sound so good, but when you're comparing it to that, so the right [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1529.36s)]
*  track number may not be so great, but compared to where it was under Biden, it's great. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1536.1599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's approval rating may not be so great until you find out that the Democrats have a 24% [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1540.1599999999999s)]
*  approval rating. You know, the, the thing that seems to be uniting the American people right now [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1544.7199999999998s)]
*  is recognizing that the government's doing a pretty shitty job. That's whether you're left or [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1549.6799999999998s)]
*  right. That's pretty universally recognized. But so Donald Trump's in a situation where I think he [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1553.84s)]
*  feels pretty politically strong. Obviously he won every swing state, won the popular vote. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1559.04s)]
*  The things like Doge are popular with the American people. And so I think he doesn't want to admit [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1564.72s)]
*  to a scandal. You know, if he were to fire the national security advisor, that's kind of an [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1570.8799999999999s)]
*  admission that like, Oh, there was a big fuck up. And I think he'd rather pretend that no, there [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1575.84s)]
*  wasn't. And I think they think because this reporter Goldberg has been so discredited and is such a [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1579.76s)]
*  liar, they can get away from this by just being like, screw that guy. You can't trust anything. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1587.44s)]
*  He says, again, the problem is just like the signal chat was real and this story appears to be real. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1591.68s)]
*  I don't trust this Goldberg guy at all, but I'm also just looking at this story and it's like, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1599.6000000000001s)]
*  no, you guys were, you were conspiring about bombing Yemen. You ended up bombing Yemen and [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1604.0s)]
*  everyone here is admitting it. So what can you say here? Anyway, let's jump into this. Here is [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1608.0s)]
*  Mike Walz on Laura Ingram show on Fox news. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1614.16s)]
*  One of the principals who was on that signal chat, national security advisor, Mike Walz, advisor, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1620.5600000000002s)]
*  well, thank you for joining us tonight. The president expressed complete confidence in you [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1624.96s)]
*  today and his entire cabinet. But how did a Trump hating editor of the Atlantic end up on your [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1629.28s)]
*  signal chat? You know, Laura, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but of all the people out there, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1634.48s)]
*  somehow this guy who has lied about the president, who has lied to gold star families, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1641.8400000000001s)]
*  lied to their attorneys and gone to Russia, hoax, gone to just all kinds of links [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1647.5200000000002s)]
*  to lie and smear the president of the United States. And he's the one that somehow gets on [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1655.3600000000001s)]
*  somebody's contact and then gets sucked into this group. All right. So just pause it. So pause it [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1662.16s)]
*  right now. Okay. So first of all, I thought this was really bizarre that walls opened up [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1666.48s)]
*  by being like, Hey, look, man, I'm sorry. But when you see something like this, you gotta jump to [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1674.8s)]
*  conspiracies. Like, Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't completely disagree with you. How the hell did [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1679.76s)]
*  this guy of all guys end up on that chat? The problem here is that the answer is you. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1686.64s)]
*  You, it's you like what, what conspiracy are you alleging? And then you can go off on like [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1691.92s)]
*  all this, you know, this is the guy who was pushing this Russia gate stuff. Yeah. The entire [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1701.04s)]
*  establishment was pushing the Russia gate stuff, literally the entire establishment who's like [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1707.92s)]
*  Devin Nunes and Stephen Miller, like a couple of guys within the establishment resisted it. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1712.96s)]
*  The rest of it was like, you know, Donald Trump himself, his family and a bunch of podcasters and [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1718.96s)]
*  real journalists out there on the internet. But you know, who else was pushing it was like [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1724.96s)]
*  your former bosses, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. So like, yeah, you're there guy. And now you're [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1730.0s)]
*  here and you're just evoking that like, yeah, I mean, this seems like a conspiracy. Okay. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1739.44s)]
*  Let's, let's put these pieces of the puzzle together here. National security advisor. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1744.8s)]
*  You tell me about this. Cause now of course, Laura Ingram, when he goes, oh, it's a conspiracy. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1750.8799999999999s)]
*  She starts going like, okay, so is someone on your team compromised? How did this end up happening? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1755.28s)]
*  Let's hear his answer. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1761.36s)]
*  Trying to cause trouble here because that's the scuttlebot out there. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1766.8s)]
*  Look, we have people, we have people, no, look, this was, this is a great group. The president [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1769.6799999999998s)]
*  has a great team. This is not first time. No, your team. I'm not talking about the other [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1774.9599999999998s)]
*  principals. No, no, no. These were principals and a couple of staff that were coordinating. As you [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1778.08s)]
*  saw, having a policy discussion as we went forward. And then just in the days before, what was an [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1783.6s)]
*  incredible strike. Not only did we take out people that the Biden team never could, that we took out [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1790.8799999999999s)]
*  headquarters, missile caches, and actually one of the leaders of the Huthu organization. We've [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1797.52s)]
*  since taken out several cents and you know, that's what they don't want to talk about. They don't [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1802.96s)]
*  want to talk about the success here. They don't want to talk about the hostages getting released. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1807.36s)]
*  They don't want to talk about the black sea, sea spire that we just put in place today as the [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1811.12s)]
*  president ends the largest land war in Europe or the border or the fact that Panama just kicked [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1815.52s)]
*  China out of the canal and success after success, success. All right. Let's pause it again. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1821.2s)]
*  I mean, I don't know why this is just, it's so pathetic and he's not even good at delivering [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1827.92s)]
*  this. I mean, he seems visibly nervous like the whole time that he's saying this, but this just [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1834.48s)]
*  like pathetic attempt to pivot back to the successes of the administration, which, you know, some of [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1839.68s)]
*  those being legit, some of them not so much, but you know, you're sitting, he's sitting there and [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1846.56s)]
*  he starts with like, Oh, like this is a, there's some type of conspiracy here. I mean, of all the [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1851.92s)]
*  people out there, this guy gets added to this group chat. And then Laura Ingraham reasonably is like, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1857.2s)]
*  yeah. So like someone on your team, right? That's the only way this would be a conspiracy. Someone [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1863.28s)]
*  here is working against the president. And then he goes, no, no, no, my team's perfect. My team's [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1869.2s)]
*  perfect. I mean, look at all the success. And what they don't want to talk about is how successful [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1873.8400000000001s)]
*  this strike at, which again, just saved me the bullshit on how successful the strike was. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1878.72s)]
*  Like, what do they even mean by that? There's are the Huthies not a problem anymore? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1883.76s)]
*  Are no more ships going to be fired upon now? Or what do you mean? You mean when we dropped the [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1890.32s)]
*  bombs, it blew shit up? Like, yeah, okay. That was, but everyone's distracting from what a success [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1895.28s)]
*  this was. Well, first of all, this story was out in, this was out for weeks before this signal [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1901.28s)]
*  scandal dropped. And yeah, like no one's really talking about what an amazing success it was, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1908.72s)]
*  because there's just, it's just not apparent that anything was achieved other than, you know, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1914.48s)]
*  killing some kids that seems to have been achieved. But you know, like, okay, what else was it? But so [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1919.04s)]
*  now you're sitting here saying, well, what exactly is the conspiracy that you're alleging here? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1926.32s)]
*  Like, and somehow this journalist hacked his way into your signal chat. Clearly he was added to the [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1931.6799999999998s)]
*  chat. I don't think any like, right. He's not claiming anything else. All right, guys, let's [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=1937.52s)]

*  Well, look, a staffer wasn't responsible. And look, I take full responsibility. I built the, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2058.48s)]
*  I built the group to my job is to make sure everything's coordinated. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2063.76s)]
*  But how does that execute? I mean, I don't mean to be pedantic here, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2066.96s)]
*  but let's pause it here. Have you ever had somebody's contact? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2069.44s)]
*  Hold on. Pause it here and then just bring it back a little bit because the next part is [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2072.32s)]
*  really wild. But I just look, you can't say I'm taking full responsibility for this. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2076.4s)]
*  I created the chat, but also there's some type of conspiracy afoot here. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2087.2000000000003s)]
*  Like which one is it? If you're taking responsibility for it, like what, how did he [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2092.9599999999996s)]
*  get added now, by the way, it is worth pointing out here that Goldberg in his piece says that [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2098.7999999999997s)]
*  they had, they, they had communicated in the past. He said he wasn't entirely surprised to be, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2109.52s)]
*  to have Mike waltz reaching out to him. So like somebody's lying here. Now we know Goldberg's a [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2118.08s)]
*  liar. Okay. So I'm not, you know, denying that that's a possibility, but it does seem like in [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2123.92s)]
*  this case, his story seems to be much more likely than it's a conspiracy. Like he doesn't want to [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2130.64s)]
*  throw a staffer under the bus and say, maybe somebody else set this up. He's saying he created [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2137.84s)]
*  the group chat. How did this guy get added to the group chat? It seems like you had to at least [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2142.8s)]
*  have his number, have his contacts of something. I don't know. Explain it to me in a way that [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2148.7200000000003s)]
*  makes sense, but that's not you taking full responsibility. And you know, like you could [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2154.48s)]
*  sit here and say like, Oh, everybody wants, you know, everybody wants to be distracted with this. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2160.48s)]
*  Instead of talking about how great the strike was, it's like you announced the strike before [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2167.12s)]
*  you did it to a journalist who hates your boss's guts. That seems like a pretty big scandal, man. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2173.04s)]
*  Like, I don't know how, how would that not be the topic of conversation? Don't get me wrong. I think [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2182.08s)]
*  the topic of conversation should be about why the hell we're going to war with Yemen, but forget [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2187.52s)]
*  that. All right, let's keep playing. And I know in the sense that he hates the president, but I [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2192.4s)]
*  don't text him. He wasn't on my phone. And we're going to figure out how this happens. So you don't [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2201.6800000000003s)]
*  know what staffer is responsible for this right now? Well, look, a staffer wasn't responsible. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2205.6800000000003s)]
*  And look, I take full responsibility. I built the, I built the group. My job is to make sure [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2211.12s)]
*  everything's coordinated. I mean, I don't mean to be pedantic here, but how did the number, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2216.2400000000002s)]
*  have you ever had, have you ever had somebody's contact that shows their name? And then you have, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2220.48s)]
*  and then you have somebody else's number there. Right. You've got somebody else's number on [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2224.16s)]
*  someone else's contact. So of course I didn't see this loser in the group. It looked like someone [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2229.84s)]
*  else. Now, whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other. Okay. This part was just [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2234.48s)]
*  wild to me. So first of all, where he got Laura Ingram is like trying to be cute or funny there. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2243.28s)]
*  And she almost like stepped over like the part where she should be like, she correctly asks the [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2249.68s)]
*  follow-up question. And then she's like, almost giving them cover in a way here. It's like, shut [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2254.7999999999997s)]
*  up, Laura. And let him say this. You're he's going, have you ever had a contact name with somebody [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2259.3599999999997s)]
*  else's number in it? Okay. Well, first of all, the answer was, is no, no, I have never had that. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2268.56s)]
*  And I'm an idiot. I've texted the wrong person, the wrong thing, but I never had the wrong number [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2275.68s)]
*  under a contact. I mean, perhaps I entered a number wrong, but again, like, what are you [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2282.0s)]
*  suggesting here? Are you suggesting that there was somebody else in that you were trying to add to [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2287.2s)]
*  this message and you got their number wrong? And that number just happened to be the number of [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2295.2799999999997s)]
*  the senior editor of the Atlantic. Are you arguing that like, he got someone's old number? Like, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2303.36s)]
*  I'm sorry, this is just so weird to me. Like what? No, I don't know. That doesn't make any sense. And [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2312.32s)]
*  then he, at the end, like, by the way, and I'll tell you that this is the truth. I know in my, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2317.44s)]
*  in my younger days, I knew, and this was never me by the way, I swear to God, I'm not just saying [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2322.32s)]
*  that, but I knew guys who like had like a, like a girl they were cheating on their girlfriend with [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2326.4s)]
*  and they had it like saved as somebody else's name. I knew a couple of guys who did that move. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2333.52s)]
*  I'm not saying they should have done that. It wasn't great. We were young at the time though, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2340.32s)]
*  but that's like the only thing I could think of in my mind. And then he seems to implicate, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2345.6800000000003s)]
*  like, I don't know that he did that. Like, how would he do that? Did he hack into your phone? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2349.84s)]
*  Did a journalist for the Atlantic was able to hack into the national security advisor's phone [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2356.7200000000003s)]
*  and put his number in somebody else's contact in his signal on the hopes that they would organize [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2362.8s)]
*  a signal group text about a bombing plan in Yemen that they would add that guy to would not realize [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2370.88s)]
*  it was really him. I mean, this is like, this makes no sense. Then by the way, if you were alleging [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2377.52s)]
*  that that is a serious crime, I mean, could you imagine you're hacking into the national security [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2382.56s)]
*  advisor's signal account and adding yourself as somebody else in there? This is just like, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2390.16s)]
*  like doesn't pass the smell test is not enough of a statement for this. This is just bullshit. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2398.24s)]
*  This is no way this is like, like the worst excuse. Somebody could come up with when they're on this [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2404.0s)]
*  spot. I can't believe, look, I don't know. What are we talking about? Okay. So 48 hours ago, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2408.56s)]
*  this story broke. This is last night. I believe Laura Ingraham is on at 9 PM. I could be wrong [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2415.04s)]
*  about that. Maybe she's 10 PM over at Fox news. So at the very least, he probably had a few hours [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2421.44s)]
*  notice that he was going on Laura Ingraham show. I mean, my, my guess is probably right now, knowing [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2429.84s)]
*  a little bit that I know about the news business and cable news and stuff like that. Someone like [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2435.92s)]
*  in Michael Waltz's position, first of all, just in general, you're the national security advisor. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2440.96s)]
*  Pretty much anyone will have you on their show. You could pick whatever show you want to do, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2447.28s)]
*  but you're the national security advisor embroiled in this scandal. That is the juicy thing that [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2450.64s)]
*  people are talking about the news of the day. You could pick any show you want to go. You can decide [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2456.32s)]
*  who I'm going to have interview me over this topic today. And he decided Laura Ingraham. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2462.4s)]
*  Now I don't know exactly when they made this decision. My guess would be [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2466.96s)]
*  the day before yesterday, probably had 24 hours before he was going into the show. It is possible. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2471.52s)]
*  They made it late. It's possible. He only had five hours or so, but you still had hours to prepare. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2477.28s)]
*  This is what you ended up coming up with. Like this is like, if you got, if you got caught red-handed [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2482.2400000000002s)]
*  on the spot and had no time to prepare, you'd think you could come up with something better [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2488.48s)]
*  than this. But the idea of being like, Oh, you know, have you ever had a contact name that [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2492.96s)]
*  didn't match the number? Like, no, that's not a common problem really. And that seems like [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2498.8s)]
*  something you would just make sure wasn't the case before you started a group chat, a, about a [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2507.2s)]
*  military campaign between the highest levels of the U S federal government. I'm sorry, man, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2513.84s)]
*  I can't be the only one who's looking at this and saying, this just makes no sense. This makes [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2520.2400000000002s)]
*  absolutely no sense. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2524.56s)]

*  into the show. All right, let's keep playing. Other technical mean is something we're trying [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2634.6400000000003s)]
*  to figure out. So your staffer did not put his contact information. No, no, no. But how did it [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2641.6800000000003s)]
*  end up in your phone? That's what we're trying to figure out. Okay, but that's a pretty big [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2648.48s)]
*  problem. That is what we've got the best technical minds, right? And that's where, I mean, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2652.72s)]
*  I'm sure everybody out there has had a contact where it was said one person and then a different [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2658.72s)]
*  phone number. But you've never talked to him before, so how's the number? Just pause it. I'm not an expert on any of this. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2664.56s)]
*  Pause it for a second here. What? Like, I'm sorry, am I crazy here? Like, Natalie, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2669.36s)]
*  anyone in the chat here? Anyone? Is that I'm sure everyone out there has had like a contact in a phone. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2674.96s)]
*  It's not. First of all, I know I've never thought of this as like a problem. Yeah, Natalie says, no, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2680.96s)]
*  that's insane. Yeah, this is like bananas. Like, and even if you had that, you'd be thinking like, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2687.76s)]
*  oh, I messed up putting his number in. I put the wrong number in. Right. And I'm just saying, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2693.84s)]
*  just running through this. And again, I was never like that strong of a math student or anything [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2701.28s)]
*  like that. But like, if you like had a contact and incorrectly put the number in the odds that that [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2705.52s)]
*  would hit the senior editor of the Atlantic, like, like it was like your contact was one number away [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2713.28s)]
*  from this guy or something like that. The odds are like insane. It's like one in millions that that [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2721.1200000000003s)]
*  would be the example. So what we're talking about here is that you what you're saying is that [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2726.4s)]
*  somebody put his information under this contact. Now, you could be alleging a conspiracy here, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2734.64s)]
*  but is Laura Ingraham kind of get that Laura Ingraham is like a Trump sycophant. So she's kind [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2741.6800000000003s)]
*  of going soft on him here. But even she starts going like, so a staffer? No, we're not saying a [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2746.08s)]
*  step. It almost seems like she's trying to assist him in this bullshit cover up, but like can't [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2751.68s)]
*  figure out how that would even work unless you're implicating a staffer. How else would this happen? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2756.72s)]
*  It makes no sense whatsoever. All right, let's keep playing. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2763.36s)]
*  How's the number on your phone? Well, if you have somebody else's contact, and then it and then [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2771.12s)]
*  somehow someone sent you that it gets sucked in. Was there someone else supposed to be on the chat [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2775.6s)]
*  that wasn't on the chat that you thought was so the person that I thought was on there was never [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2780.16s)]
*  on there. It was it was that's what person. Well, I'm not look, Laura, I take I take responsibility. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2784.96s)]
*  I built the I built the group. Okay, so that's that. But look, that's the part that we have to [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2790.8799999999997s)]
*  figure out. And that's the part that we were embarrassing. Yes. But Pete and I are veterans, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2796.72s)]
*  we know these operations. He has been an excellent Secretary of Defense. And this was an operation [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2802.7999999999997s)]
*  that I mean, it amazes me, I guess the Democrats were fine to leave all the sea lanes shut down, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2809.76s)]
*  we're fine to have destroyers fired on dozens of times by this terrorist group and find to have [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2815.0400000000004s)]
*  Iran keep supplying the missiles. That was okay. The President takes decisive action. And now we're [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2820.7200000000003s)]
*  seeing some real success and taking down their air defenses, opening the sea lanes, taking out [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2826.6400000000003s)]
*  their leadership. We don't want to talk about that. We want to talk about the Atlantic told us. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2831.2000000000003s)]
*  All right. I mean, Jesus Christ. Okay, sorry. It's just like, this is just an and look, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2835.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, if you were trying like I must be your target demo. If you're sitting here going like, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2843.52s)]
*  Yeah, but the Democrats are so bad, you know, and the corporate media is so bad. It's like, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2849.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know, dude. And, you know, part of the reason why people aren't talking about what an [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2852.72s)]
*  amazing success this strike on Yemen was, because it's all bullshit. Like there was no success. You [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2860.32s)]
*  can't point to any success. Oh, they're I guess they're just fine with the shipping lanes being [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2865.2s)]
*  closed. And this terrorist organization, you know, terrorist organization, whatever the hell [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2869.7599999999998s)]
*  that even means anymore. How exactly we get to call the Houthis terrorists, but what we're doing [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2874.3999999999996s)]
*  to Yemen isn't terrorism, or what Israel's doing to Gaza isn't terrorism, or what the Saudis did [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2886.64s)]
*  to Yemen isn't terrorism. Like, but you find me a consistent definition for terrorism that says the [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2892.56s)]
*  Houthis are terrorists, but the US military, the Israeli military and the Saudi military aren't. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2898.48s)]
*  And essentially, as we always say on the show, right, it's the old Noam Chomsky line. But I love [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2904.08s)]
*  that. It's one of Noam Chomsky's best ever. But when someone asked him, she goes, well, what [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2909.68s)]
*  differentiates terrorism from these military actions? And he goes, Oh, it's very simple. If [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2914.7999999999997s)]
*  they do it, it's terrorism. If we do it, it's counterterrorism. And that's pretty much the case. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2919.52s)]
*  But look, it's just not true. Just none of this is true. This is such bullshit. You're as you're as [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2925.44s)]
*  big a liar as the Democrats and the corporate media right now. First of all, Joe Biden bombed [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2931.68s)]
*  the Houthis and for the exact same reason he did this. You can go watch there's tape of Donald [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2937.2s)]
*  Trump when he was on Tim Pool show last summer specifically talking about this and how stupid [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2943.2s)]
*  he thought it was that Joe Biden's bombing Yemen. And he goes, man, these guys just always want to [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2950.16s)]
*  drop bombs. It's like their answer to everything. What about diplomacy? Why can't we talk to people? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2955.12s)]
*  You could pick up a phone and do more good than you can just drop in bombs on all your problems. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2960.48s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump was saying last summer when Joe Biden was bombing the Houthis. And for [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2964.96s)]
*  the same reason, because they were shooting at ships going by in protest over what Israel's doing [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2969.84s)]
*  to get to Gaza. Okay. So this whole thing is just bullshit. It's all bullshit. I just say like, why [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2975.04s)]
*  is it like, it's so ridiculous to sit here and go, well, why is it that people are talking about [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2981.52s)]
*  this signal thing instead of talking about what an overwhelming success this bombing campaign was? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2987.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, there's two major reasons. Number one, the bombing campaign wasn't a success. Number two, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2993.76s)]
*  because the national security advisor added the fucking senior editor at the Atlantic to the [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=2999.2799999999997s)]
*  goddamn group chat planning a future military attack. That's why we're talking about it. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3004.24s)]
*  Sorry, that's a scandal. There's no universe in which that's not a scandal. I mean, it's crazy [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3009.7599999999998s)]
*  that there's a universe in which bombing a poor third world country isn't a scandal. Like there's, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3016.08s)]
*  it's crazy. What's really crazy is that we actually live in a universe where the scandal [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3022.64s)]
*  isn't the fact that there seems to be consensus within the group that this wasn't time sensitive, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3028.56s)]
*  that it didn't need to happen when it happened. Meaning, in other words, there was plenty of time [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3035.2799999999997s)]
*  to go to Congress and get authorization for this strike. If you remember in that dusty old book [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3041.3599999999997s)]
*  called the constitution, Congress is the one who's supposed to have the war powers, not, not a [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3046.08s)]
*  group of people on signal. That wasn't exactly the founder's intention for the country. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3052.72s)]
*  That's a scandal, but I'm sorry, even in our crazy universe where those things somehow are [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3058.48s)]
*  not considered scandals, it's a goddamn scandal when the national security advisor, who used to [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3063.2s)]
*  be Dick Cheney's counterterrorism advisor is adding the most Trump hating, lying corporate [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3068.96s)]
*  journalists to their signal account. And that his explanation for this just makes zero sense [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3078.4s)]
*  at all. He's sitting there saying, I take full responsibility, except none of the responsibilities [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3084.08s)]
*  on me. Right? I mean, isn't that essentially what he's saying? He's sitting here and saying, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3090.2400000000002s)]
*  I take full responsibility. I'm the one who created the group chat. How did this guy get [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3095.92s)]
*  added to the group chat? Well, it's certainly not my fault. What's your plus plausible alternative [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3100.4s)]
*  explanation? Don't have one. You know, contact names and numbers. You know how it goes. Everyone's [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3106.72s)]
*  had that except everyone hasn't had that. None of this makes any sense. You're totally skirting [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3113.8399999999997s)]
*  responsibility, but while claiming that you're taking responsibility for the whole thing, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3119.8399999999997s)]
*  and really all you've got to say is our best, we got great people on it. Top guys on the job. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3124.48s)]
*  We'll get to the bottom of this. This is horrible. It's like, this is just awful. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3130.4s)]
*  All right. Let's let's keep playing. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3137.12s)]
*  Barrage and discredit us and our reporting following obvious playbook by elected officials [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3141.92s)]
*  and others power who are hostile to journalists and first amendment rights of all Americans. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3146.2400000000002s)]
*  They're saying, don't blame the messenger. He responds to them, lied about Russia, lied about [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3151.12s)]
*  gold star families, lied about even as last what year in terms of the president paying for the [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3157.84s)]
*  family of a gold star family that he absolutely did. I mean, lie after lie after lie. Have they [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3166.8s)]
*  ever apologized for any of that? No, I mean, yeah, but you're lying right now. We care about the [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3172.0s)]
*  you can't just sit here and call everybody else a liar while you're clearly lying about this. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3178.32s)]
*  This like, I, what do you want me to say here? I mean, look, dude, it's going to, it takes a lot [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3183.12s)]
*  to get me to trust one of these lying hacks from the Atlantic. But as of right now, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3190.7999999999997s)]
*  when he, his story makes way more sense than Mike Walz's story. I think that I think Walt's [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3198.64s)]
*  does have a relationship with this guy. I think he had his contact info on signal. Now [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3207.2s)]
*  it is whether or not he accidentally added him to this list or this was some type of intentional [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3212.8s)]
*  thing that kind of remains to be seen. I don't know about that, but I think he's fucking lying [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3217.6000000000004s)]
*  right now about this. I think he is in contact with that journalist and this pivoting to he lies [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3223.76s)]
*  about everything just doesn't work when you're so clearly lying through your teeth about the [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3229.52s)]
*  current scandal at hand right now. All right, let's, let's play a little bit more. What I care about [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3234.32s)]
*  is staying focused on mission, accomplishing the president's agenda, getting these things done, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3241.92s)]
*  cleaning up the Biden messes from Afghanistan to Ukraine, to the Houthis, to the border, to China [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3247.2000000000003s)]
*  all over South America, to the Arctic, where we're completely exposed to NATO that's not paying up. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3253.76s)]
*  And the president has had success after success and he's got a fantastic national security team. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3260.64s)]
*  I mean, I think it's just stunning how many people on the team have his 100% trust and there have [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3266.56s)]
*  been enormous successes early on in this administration, but you all are rattling the old cages of the [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3273.92s)]
*  establishment, defense and national security embedded people who are still working government, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3280.08s)]
*  a lot of great people. But the concern is, is that somebody got involved here who didn't want the [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3285.92s)]
*  president to be successful. And a lot of us are very concerned about that, that someone is in this [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3292.16s)]
*  orbit who doesn't want this president of the United States to be a raging success and turn our foreign [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3298.48s)]
*  policy into an America first approach. Look, there, we made a mistake. We're moving forward and we're [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3304.3999999999996s)]
*  going to continue to knock it out of the park for this president. Look at what he's gotten done in [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3311.7599999999998s)]
*  under two months. And I didn't even get going on the economy, on trade or all of those other things. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3317.36s)]
*  April 2nd is coming. The DNI was very adamant today and very clear that there was no classified [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3323.84s)]
*  information in this text chat. And the Democrats, of course, are predictably, they're going to jump [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3330.7200000000003s)]
*  on this. But should Goldberg just release the other information that he has, because he's standing on [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3336.48s)]
*  this well, I'm not going to release this information because I have my standards and journalistic [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3343.44s)]
*  standards. Okay, but it's not classified information. So does it matter? Would you care if the [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3346.56s)]
*  rest of this information came out? Look, I mean, I would prefer certainly as the president was [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3351.7599999999998s)]
*  saying today, if we could all sit in a steel lined, you know, steel lined lead room and have all of [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3357.6s)]
*  these conversations, I certainly want our deliberations to stay confidential. This was an encrypted app [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3363.04s)]
*  that the CIA had on sitting there as John Radcliffe was confirmed and walked into the building from the [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3368.88s)]
*  prior administration. It's on other agency apps. And so, no, of course, I don't want it all out [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3375.12s)]
*  there. Because these were conversations back and forth that you should be able to have. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3381.8399999999997s)]
*  All right, let's just leave it there. What you use is so isn't it funny. And what I thought was so [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3386.7999999999997s)]
*  remarkable about this interview, right, is you got to remember here, this guy could have gone on any [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3392.4s)]
*  show he wanted to. He picked Laura Ingram show to go on because she's a cheerleader of this [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3397.92s)]
*  administration. And she is actively trying to help him in this cover up. Like she's trying her [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3404.0s)]
*  best. And there's just but none of the outs that she's giving him he's willing to take. So she keeps [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3412.16s)]
*  going like, Oh, yeah, probably a staffer, right. So you could kind of say someone else under me [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3417.2s)]
*  fucked up, we're going to figure out who that is. It's this is how this is how scandals in DC are [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3421.92s)]
*  typically swept under the rug, you find somebody who's known as the fall guy, that's the term that [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3430.8s)]
*  they use for it, right. And then you end up blaming them. So you find out how it was a staffer who [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3436.5600000000004s)]
*  did this, you know, behind closed doors, you tell them, you're gonna have to take the fall for this, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3442.1600000000003s)]
*  the scant, the the staffer is fired. And then you go, we did an investigation, we got to the bottom [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3447.1200000000003s)]
*  of it. He won't take that bait. Because he recognizes that's admitting too much. So then [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3452.88s)]
*  she's trying her best. And then at the end, she's like, you know, Hey, let me throw this [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3460.32s)]
*  journalists under the bus a little bit. You know what he's saying? He won't release the whole chat [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3465.36s)]
*  because there's a, you know, there's, there's classified material in there. Well, I'd say [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3470.56s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard was adamant and saying there's no classified material. So release the whole chat. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3476.2400000000002s)]
*  Then how come he won't? What does he have to hide? Right? National security advisor. And then he [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3480.88s)]
*  turns around and goes, no, I don't want the whole thing released. This is because yeah, no, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3486.56s)]
*  wait, I don't want, I don't want that out there. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3492.72s)]
*  sponsor for today's show, which is tax network USA. The IRS is the largest collection agency in [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3496.24s)]
*  the world. And it just stepped up enforcement for 2025. If you owe back taxes or have unfiled [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3503.52s)]
*  returns, do not wait for the IRS to come after you simply avoiding your tax troubles is the worst [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3510.08s)]
*  thing you can do. Getting ahead of this is the smart move, but never, never contact the IRS alone. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3515.52s)]
*  Turn it over to the team at tax network USA, because not all tax resolution companies are the [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3522.32s)]
*  same. Tax network USA has a preferred direct line to the IRS. This means that they know which agents [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3527.7599999999998s)]
*  to deal with and which agents to avoid. Tax network USA has proven strategies that are designed to [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3534.16s)]
*  settle your tax problems in your favor. Whether you owe $10,000 or $10 million, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3540.0s)]
*  their attorneys and negotiators have resolved over 1 billion in tax debt. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3545.36s)]
*  Talk with one of their strategists. It's free. Stop the threatening letters. Stop looking over [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3549.76s)]
*  your shoulders and put your IRS troubles behind you once and for all. Give them a call at 1-800-958-1000 [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3555.04s)]
*  or visit them at tnusa.com slash Smith. That's tnusa.com slash Smith. All right, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3560.8s)]
*  let's get back into the show. Look, I don't even know. I'm [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3570.48s)]
*  speaking a little bit above my pay grade here and I suppose there could be a gap in the two, but [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3576.96s)]
*  wouldn't future bombing plans by their very nature have to be classified? I mean, maybe it's not [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3582.64s)]
*  technically, but wouldn't if you're talking about a military action that's coming up, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3596.32s)]
*  that detailed battle plans, battle maybe is not exactly the right word to use in these type of, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3602.48s)]
*  but plans to bomb an apartment building, which is what they ended up bombing by the way in Yemen. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3609.68s)]
*  How is that not secret? Like by definition, isn't that secret? You're talking about plans [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3618.08s)]
*  of bombing something. You can't have that out there or the guy you're trying to get will leave [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3623.3599999999997s)]
*  or won't be there or whatever. This just makes absolutely no sense. Absolutely no sense. And of [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3628.3999999999996s)]
*  course, not a shock. He doesn't want it out there. He doesn't want anyway, the full chat is out. It's [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3633.52s)]
*  on the internet. I know they published it over at a anti war.com. If anyone wants to go check it out. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3640.56s)]
*  One of the things that's one of the ugliest things about it is that they essentially in here, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3646.48s)]
*  I'll read from it. And this is more that came out that wasn't in the, that wasn't in the original [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3654.08s)]
*  piece, but it's clearly the top guy who they're trying to get. The signal chat reveals that they [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3661.84s)]
*  waited for, they call them the top missile guy, the Houthis top missile guy in the chat. They [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3670.88s)]
*  waited for him to walk into a residential building where his girlfriend lived before launching the [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3677.6000000000004s)]
*  airstrike that collapsed the building. JD Vance referred to that as excellent [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3682.88s)]
*  in the group chat. It seems that Tulsi Gabbard also celebrated it afterward. And you know, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3691.76s)]
*  it's just as, as Dave DeCamp, as the great Dave DeCamp wrote on Twitter, I'll read this real quickly. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3703.6800000000003s)]
*  We could wrap on that. We said, imagine a foreign country flattening an apartment building in the [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3709.04s)]
*  U S because an American general entered it. Never in a million years would Americans think [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3714.16s)]
*  that was acceptable and not regarded as terrorism. A short tweet, very well said. And just retweet [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3719.52s)]
*  that now. Yeah, it's kind of like what I was saying before about what distinguishes terrorism [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3727.44s)]
*  from what we do. And it's not much. It's essentially just the fact that we do it. Anyway, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3735.44s)]
*  this scandal is a look, it's not a scandal for the reasons that I would think of it as a scandal, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3742.88s)]
*  or at least that's not how it's being portrayed in the media. But like the biggest thing here is [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3749.84s)]
*  just like how terrible it is that Donald Trump is bombing the poorest country in Yemen on behalf of [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3756.88s)]
*  Israel. I'm sorry. The poorest country in the middle East on behalf of Israel. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3762.4s)]
*  It's, it's appalling that all of these guys in this new administration were just cheering it on. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3768.48s)]
*  You know, meet the new boss. All right, we're going to wrap on that. Oh, I should. Okay. Before [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3779.36s)]
*  we leave a couple of quick announcements. Number one, since I am flying out to Boston tomorrow, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3786.96s)]
*  I'll, I'll be flying. I think we're not in the hotel yet during our normal recording time. So [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3792.96s)]
*  instead of tomorrow, we're going to do the members only episode on Friday. It'll be another extra [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3798.4s)]
*  long one because we're still making up the ones that we missed a couple of weeks ago. And then [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3802.96s)]
*  this Saturday for the people in the top tier, there's our, our monthly zoom meeting. That'll [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3807.52s)]
*  also be an extra long one. So some fun stuff coming up this weekend. And then see, I'm sure [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3813.36s)]
*  I'll see a bunch of you guys out in Boston looking forward to it. All right, catch you next time. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3819.04s)]
*  Peace. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XLBsEn9F4&t=3822.56s)]
