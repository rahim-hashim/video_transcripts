# Dave Smith | Keith Knight | Part Of The Problem 1242
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM)
*  Hey, what's up everybody. Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. Very quickly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=0.0s)]
*  before we get started, just a reminder, I will be in Boston, Massachusetts at laugh [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Boston with Robbie the fire Bernstein. That's coming up in a couple of weeks, comic davesmith.com [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=16.84s)]
*  for ticket links. Very excited to get back to Boston. One of my favorite comedy towns [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=21.6s)]
*  in the world. And then of course, a reminder, there are still some seats left. I will be [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=25.82s)]
*  debating Alex Norwas at the Soho forum. The Soho forum.org is the website. That's the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=30.060000000000002s)]
*  debate series run by the great Gene Epstein. If you're in the New York City area, make [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=38.34s)]
*  sure you come by. It's going to be a lot of fun. All right. Always a good day when I am [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=42.58s)]
*  joined by the great Keith Knight. He is the managing director of the libertarian Institute. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=47.5s)]
*  Also, he is the author of domestic imperialism, phenomenal book, I highly, highly recommend [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=52.9s)]
*  it. And of course, you guys over at the libertarian Institute, we mentioned this when Scott was [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=58.62s)]
*  on last week, but you guys are in the middle of your, your fund drive. So why don't you [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=62.32s)]
*  real quickly before we get into the show, tell people about the Institute and the fundraiser [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=67.74s)]
*  and how they can help. Well, as much as we love complaining about the corporate press [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=71.7s)]
*  education system and how horrible the universities are, we actually want to create an alternative [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=78.74s)]
*  for people to go to at libertarianinstitute.org. Use our search engine to type in any historical [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=84.3s)]
*  issue, any economic issue, any philosophical issue and get the proper idea of how society [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=90.1s)]
*  should be organized through social cooperation, as opposed to coercion by the state. So that's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=97.44s)]
*  what we're trying to do at the libertarian Institute, create a free online educational [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=103.36s)]
*  archive for everyone. You can write off any donations on your taxes. And if you pay 50 [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=107.64s)]
*  bucks, you can actually get a physical book in exchange for a donation. So check it out [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=113.16s)]
*  at libertarianinstitute.org. Yeah, dude, I mean, I've been saying this at this point, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=118.28s)]
*  because me and you both like we've we've known each other for years now. And I've known Scott [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=122.92s)]
*  for years. And I knew I remember when Scott was first starting up the libertarian Institute [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=127.4s)]
*  when it was just an idea and then kind of watching it get bigger over the years. And at [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=131.84s)]
*  this point, it really is like people will ask me like, oh, what's a good reading list to get [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=135.6s)]
*  started? And I've been more and more finding myself going, just go look at the books the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  libertarian Institute has published. I mean, they really are like, like your book, Domestic [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=143.8s)]
*  Imperialism was phenomenal. The the best book on Ukraine, the best book on COVID that I mean, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=148.3s)]
*  like literally, like I'm not exaggerating. If there was one book to read about the Ukraine [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=155.82s)]
*  war, it's provoked. If there was one book to read about the COVID crisis, it's Diary of a Psychosis [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=159.84s)]
*  by the great Tom Woods. And that's just those are just three of the list of books, which is that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=165.28s)]
*  there's got to be 20 books, something like that at this point, that the Institute's put out. And [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=170.0s)]
*  they're just every last one of them is phenomenal. So the best organization you can support if you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  are in a position to do it, please go, please go help those guys out. So we can keep doing all this [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=179.84s)]
*  cool stuff. All right. So me and you had talked the other day about doing this show. And we were [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=184.56s)]
*  talking about like maybe doing an episode on kind of the woke left and then this argument now over [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=191.6s)]
*  the woke right. And it just weirdly, we plan this, I promise you have to take my word for it. But [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=197.52s)]
*  we were planning this before I got in a little bit of a Twitter back and forth with Constantine [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=202.4s)]
*  Kusen last night. And it was just maybe part that kind of informed me because that was in my mind [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=206.96s)]
*  too. But it really was, we'll get back to that part, but it really was just like, I just, it was [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=213.04s)]
*  one of those moments where I just found myself being like, but how can you, the same guy who said this [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=218.16s)]
*  now be saying this and not have any type of like, you're not feeling like that, that cognitive [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=225.12s)]
*  dissonance vibe in your mind. Like it's not vibrating right now. And you're going, huh, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=230.56s)]
*  well, I can't, I can't really say this because my entire identity was that. And so anyway, this is, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  wild to me. It's been an interesting kind of a online debate. I'm not sure if the term woke [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=239.6s)]
*  right can be revitalized or if it can be appropriately applied, but I think it's an [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=247.68s)]
*  interesting conversation to have nonetheless. So you want to start with the woke left maybe, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=255.12s)]
*  and then we'll get into the woke right divide or how do you, how do you want to do it? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=259.52s)]
*  Sounds good. Let's give the OG wokeists their respect before moving on to the new [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=263.44s)]
*  term. Please. By the way, we could, we could argue this in a second, but I'm not sure they're the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=268.24s)]
*  OGs, but yes, what everyone thinks of as the OG wokeists. The ones who popularized the term in [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=273.68s)]
*  my generation at least. So when it comes to the woke left, this would be anyone who assumes that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=281.92s)]
*  disparities in wealth are proof of exploitation in the economic realm and anyone who sees [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=287.28s)]
*  disparities in outcomes between groups as proof of discrimination. So when it comes to the economic [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=293.44s)]
*  side of things, if they see some people with wealth in a certain country and other people in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=299.84s)]
*  another country that have less wealth, this must be the result of colonialism or imperialism. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't occur to them that what happens first is countries get wealthy and then engage in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=312.8s)]
*  imperialist or colonialist actions. When it comes to wealth between individuals in a society, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=318.16s)]
*  they assume the very wealthy exist and the very poor exist. The wealthy must have taken that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=324.64s)]
*  wealth from the poor who also work there, who work at factories employed by the wealthy. It doesn't [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=330.56s)]
*  occur to them that there is also a disparity in productivity levels between these individuals. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=337.76s)]
*  So we should always assume that because there are so few Jeff Bezos' and Steve Jobs' and LeBron [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=343.92s)]
*  James' that those people will one, get a disproportionate amount of attention among the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=350.32s)]
*  population and that will correlate to a very high level of income because they're just so much more [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=355.2s)]
*  productive. They can acquire such a higher social status as opposed to everyone getting access to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=361.28s)]
*  things equally. They don't account for the fact that entrepreneurs take the initial risk in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  investing in a startup business. The entrepreneur comes up with the idea of what to sell, which is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=374.4s)]
*  extraordinarily difficult. They start the business with investments, which may or may not pay off. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=380.32s)]
*  They have to find out where to market their product. They have to engage in web design. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=387.04s)]
*  All of these extraordinarily difficult things, the average person doesn't have the time for, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  doesn't want to take the risk. So you have a very small number of people who are willing to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  engage in those activities. Most of those people do not succeed. The ones who do end up with a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=400.88s)]
*  disproportionate amount of wealth. The woke leftists in the economic realm has to ask themselves why [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=406.48s)]
*  we don't see 100% of people getting paid the minimum wage because that's legally all you have [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=413.52s)]
*  to pay. Everyone could just earn the minimum wage. Immediately you see that as a causal result of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=419.12s)]
*  capital investment, which makes workers more productive, once they get access to telephones, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=424.48s)]
*  computers, machinery, as far as agriculture goes, each worker becomes more productive [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=429.6s)]
*  and they're competing with other employers for the best employees. This is what raises wages. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=435.04s)]
*  It's capital investment along with competition, which increases the likelihood that people will [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=441.52s)]
*  acquire wealth. It is not the result of exploitation. Exactly right. It strikes me [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=446.8s)]
*  to get a little bit psychological with this in a way because there is something that I think it's [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=454.72s)]
*  kind of hard if you look at, say, the young generation today. This is true of my generation [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=459.6s)]
*  when we were young too. It's hard not to see, at least compared to previous generations, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=465.92s)]
*  how strikingly immature young people are. I'm just saying objectively, when you look at it, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=472.32s)]
*  in my grandfather's day, by the time you turned 18, you had already been considered a man [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  for quite a bit. You were going to go fight in a war. You were certainly, if you had finished high [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  school or even if you hadn't finished high school, you were going to move out of your parent's house. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=493.12s)]
*  You were going to buy a house. You were going to start a family. You were going to do what are [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=496.72s)]
*  considered adult things to do. Today, we see, and I'm guilty of this too, I mean, I'm about to be 42. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=500.4s)]
*  I'm in a hoodie right now. It's just kind of ridiculous. We all are very young. We're very [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=507.6s)]
*  slow to mature. It does strike me now being a father that even as you say this, the only thing [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=512.32s)]
*  that comes into my mind is it's such a childish way of looking at the world. Not just young for a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=519.76s)]
*  child. I mean, small children, like a 12-year-old should be above that. But the idea that I have a [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=526.72s)]
*  three-year-old and a six-year-old and if one of them gets a bigger cookie than the other one, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=533.2s)]
*  they have an instinct in them to be not fair. It's not fair that someone gets more than the other. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=538.88s)]
*  And reasonably so. It is the expectation for little children that things will be provided to them [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=545.12s)]
*  in a fair manner. And it does seem to me that this is almost what you see with woke leftist [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=551.28s)]
*  college students. The idea is that everybody should get an equal amount, but this just doesn't jive [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=556.88s)]
*  with adulthood because the truth is that as we all know, in the same way that everyone shouldn't get [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=563.76s)]
*  the same grades at school, it's like, well, someone worked harder. Someone was smarter. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=569.36s)]
*  Someone was better at memorizing information. Maybe not even smarter, but just better at [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=574.16s)]
*  memorizing information out of a textbook. And so, of course, first of all, when it comes to wealth [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=577.76s)]
*  creation, no one is the grownup in this equation. You're the grownup. No one is just giving you the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=582.88s)]
*  wealth. It's not as if it was just, it is created by us adults. And so, of course, the expectation [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=588.96s)]
*  that it would fall into completely evenly divided categories just makes no sense. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=595.2s)]
*  And so, it's just very interesting to me. I think it says something about how immature we are as a [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=602.6400000000001s)]
*  society that these ideas would ever even gain traction amongst adults. And even if you give [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=606.96s)]
*  the socialists everything they ask for, there's still massive inequality. That which they promise [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  to resolve, you automatically see inequality between all the democratic socialists, AOC, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=619.68s)]
*  Pocahontas, Bernie Sanders. Those people are very disproportionate in their wealth, power, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  and influence to all of their constituents. Of course, it's ridiculous to mention, but obviously, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=633.5999999999999s)]
*  Chairman Mao was not equal to the average person in China. Even in ancient Greece, the average person [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=639.68s)]
*  was not equal in power and social status to Aristotle. Fidel Castro, very unequal to anyone [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=644.64s)]
*  else in Cuba. So, the equality lie seems to just be something that they play on your emotions to [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=650.88s)]
*  create this sort of tension among the masses to see the state as the ultimate savior. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=657.76s)]
*  Lou Rockwell famously said that the reason that they push this lie is because it's unachievable. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=663.52s)]
*  We know in every society there's some elites and there's people with a lot less power. So, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=669.6s)]
*  they push this lie because it forever and always will be a justification to expand the state power. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=675.76s)]
*  All right, we've done a bunch of things. Well, everyone's still not equal. Guess we need more [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  money and power for the state. So, because it's an impossible goal to reach, that goalpost is always [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=686.32s)]
*  going to be moving. It's always going to be a justification for the state to grow. As far as [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=692.4s)]
*  being immature, this is referred to as the Santa Claus principle. So, you have the scarcity [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=698.24s)]
*  principle, which the Austrian economists embrace. Every second you spend doing something, that's one [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=703.04s)]
*  second you're not spending doing other things. Every dollar you spend on this, every cubic ounce [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  of concrete you spend on this project, you can't spend on a different resource. The Santa Claus [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=714.64s)]
*  principle is, well, everyone can have everything. We could just increase the money supply and that's [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=720.08s)]
*  not going to have an effect on the value of any of other dollars in circulation. The Santa Claus [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=725.44s)]
*  principle is literally the child who believes in the North Pole, a guy makes stuff, gets it around [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  the world at no opportunity cost. It's that ridiculous. So, when they say, well, I think [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=736.72s)]
*  everyone should have health care and it should be free, as if getting the state to coercively fund [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=741.84s)]
*  something makes it free, it's as ridiculous as saying, well, the military is free, government, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=746.8800000000001s)]
*  I've never gotten a bill from the Pentagon, so it must be free. Obviously, it's not free. Then, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=751.28s)]
*  if you take the case of health care, housing or education, the state has producers answering to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=756.72s)]
*  the state for whether or not their products meet consumer demand, instead of the consumer being [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=763.04s)]
*  empowered to determine whether or not to associate with certain companies and buy their products. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=768.4s)]
*  Kodak went out of business because they didn't meet consumer demand. Blockbuster went out of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=774.16s)]
*  business. Sears and A&P Grocers, all of these places did because they were answering to consumers. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=778.72s)]
*  But once they start answering to the state, he who pays the piper calls the tune, then they worry [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  about what the state has as far as what metrics are sufficient for them to produce products and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=790.64s)]
*  services, and they ignore customers. That's why everything the state creates is absolutely [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  very low in quality and extraordinarily high in price. So, the Santa Claus principle that the woke [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  leftists on the economic realm embrace is primarily the cause of much lower quality and [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=807.12s)]
*  much higher prices than we otherwise would have. Yeah, it just seems like a lot of this stuff [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=813.52s)]
*  is not even like the true divide ought to be left and right. It's just fiction versus reality. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=818.64s)]
*  I remember there was this article, I believe it was in the New York Times Magazine, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=827.2s)]
*  this was like a few years ago, it might have been like five or six years ago, but there was this [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=832.0s)]
*  woman from like a feminist and she wrote some article, it was like, can we really have it all? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=835.36s)]
*  The title was something like that. And she was actually being somewhat reasonable in the article. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=842.48s)]
*  She was basically like, look, feminists made this promise of we can have it all, you can be a working [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=847.6s)]
*  mom and have all the benefits of being a full-time mom and blah blah blah. And she's like, yeah, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  we have to kind of re-question that. So, the article wasn't even unreasonable. It's just like, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=856.88s)]
*  how are we even having a conversation amongst adults about whether or not you can have it all? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=862.4799999999999s)]
*  Who gets past the point of like 10 and doesn't realize that like, yeah, no, that's not life. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=870.8s)]
*  As the great Thomas Sowell put it, all of life is trade-offs. I say this is somebody who's like [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=877.8399999999999s)]
*  a big believer in marriage and having kids, but they are trade-offs. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=884.56s)]
*  Like listen, kids give you a lot of joy and a lot of meaning and you get to like, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=889.12s)]
*  feel like you have the next generation to pass things down to, but you're going to have less [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=896.6400000000001s)]
*  disposable income. You're going to have less free time. You're going to have more responsibility. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=899.84s)]
*  There's nothing in life where there isn't some degree of a trade-off. And a lot of that is [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=905.2800000000001s)]
*  because the number one scarce resource, as you pointed out, is time. You can't do everything. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=909.6800000000001s)]
*  You only have one life that you can live. And in that life, if we had infinite lives, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=916.8000000000001s)]
*  I guess we could have it all, but we don't. And it does seem, again, there's a striking immaturity [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=921.76s)]
*  about this view. And it does, when you really think about it, I think a lot of times [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=928.1600000000001s)]
*  when people see the woke left, they just focus on the kind of crazy social stuff, understandably. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=933.2s)]
*  But there are these kind of deeper priors that they have, which is why they get everything wrong. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=939.5200000000001s)]
*  This is why their conclusions are so ridiculous. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=947.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the foundations are all completely backwards. If you just look at the feminist [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=950.96s)]
*  issue in the case of having it all, the sitting president of America actually came out and said, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=956.1600000000001s)]
*  this would have been, I want to say in like 2015 or something, Obama came out and said, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=963.2s)]
*  the wage gap is not myth, it's math. Apparently, a Harvard graduate believes in the gender wage [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=968.16s)]
*  gap. But as you said, you can't have it all. The reason men make more is one, they work [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=975.8399999999999s)]
*  different jobs and have different skills. The same reason 20 year olds make a hell of a lot less [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=981.68s)]
*  than 40 year olds, not because we need equal age or anti-age discrimination, because they have [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=987.76s)]
*  different jobs, they have different skills. Men are much more likely to die at the workplace. Men [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=994.72s)]
*  are much more likely to move to get work. The most dangerous jobs, the lumberjacks, those are all men. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  That's why I want to say OSHA says about 91% of workplace deaths are male. This is because men [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1006.08s)]
*  are willing to take more risk and the vast amount of homeless people are also men. This gets into [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1013.28s)]
*  the woke aspect of disparities between groups or proof of discrimination. They never mention the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1018.88s)]
*  inconvenient disparities that only one gender has had to register for selective service, slavery, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1024.24s)]
*  the draft in American history. They don't mention the fact that it's totally legal to genitally [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1031.2s)]
*  mutilate a baby boy, whereas to do so for a girl is justly illegal and a crime that you would be [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1038.16s)]
*  in jail for. They assume that if there's more men represented at a place of work, that's discrimination [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1046.72s)]
*  against women, even though something like 89% of elementary teachers are female, the vast majority [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1052.48s)]
*  of nurses are female, the vast majority of babysitters are female, not because men are [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1058.96s)]
*  being discriminated against, because women work better with people and men tend to work better with [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1063.2s)]
*  things. Men are higher risk takers. The reason 95.5% of people killed by the police are men [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1067.92s)]
*  is not because of a huge sexist issue against men when it comes to the police. Men are much more [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1074.88s)]
*  violent. Younger people are more likely to get killed by the police than older people because [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1081.68s)]
*  younger men have higher levels of testosterone and are much more apt to commit violence. So we see [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1086.24s)]
*  these disparities everywhere. You would also think in the dating market that if men just had all the [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1092.0s)]
*  power that women would be constantly going up to guys asking, can I please have sex with you? And [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1098.88s)]
*  if I have sex with you a few times, maybe I could convince you to take me out to dinner. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1105.92s)]
*  It's the opposite. It's the guy begging for the woman's attention saying, I'll take you out a [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1110.88s)]
*  bunch of times and maybe in exchange, we could get intimate together. Just every aspect of life. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1114.96s)]
*  This is not even close to resembling reality where the men have all the power and the women just have [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1120.64s)]
*  no institutional power at all. Yeah, no, 100%. And of course, it does seem that we've in the moment [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1126.64s)]
*  we're living in now, it does seem like a lot of this stuff is being rejected. And I don't know, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1134.56s)]
*  you know, I'm very pleased with that development. It's really hard to overstate how much just a few [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1142.24s)]
*  years ago, it seemed like this was just the dominant trend and we were never going to get [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1152.6399999999999s)]
*  away from this. You know, I remember thinking I was very wrong. This is one of the predictions I [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1158.24s)]
*  was very mistaken about. But I remember thinking when COVID first hit, I was like, this is going [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1164.56s)]
*  to be the end of wokeism. Because now we got like real shit that we got to deal with. Like, people [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1170.8s)]
*  aren't gonna you know what I mean? Like all this like me to stuff that dominated the previous two [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1176.88s)]
*  years. I go that's not we're in the middle of lockdowns. Now people are scared of the virus, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1181.04s)]
*  the government's going totally totalitarian. All this I was wrong. The wokeism continued somehow [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1185.12s)]
*  past that. It does seem like now there's just and I don't know exactly. I mean, I think part of this [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1191.6799999999998s)]
*  is like exhaustion on the woke left itself. It is it is hard to maintain. We're living in the, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1198.3999999999999s)]
*  you know, early 30s rise of the Nazis forever when there's just nothing to back that up around you. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1206.8799999999999s)]
*  I also do think it's a it's part of the dynamic, at least, is that the anti woke crusaders, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1213.76s)]
*  be those kind of right wingers, libertarians, the people like us who have been, you know, talking [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1221.76s)]
*  about this stuff for a long time. They just came with such better arguments over and over again, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1226.1599999999999s)]
*  that eventually the woke were just destroyed. I mean, look, it's kind of it's a joke when Matt [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  Walsh can just can destroy your entire worldview by asking you what a woman is, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1237.12s)]
*  you know, how long can you keep going? And in some sense, there is something encouraging about that [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1243.1999999999998s)]
*  where I'm not saying it's the entire the entire reason that we're where we are. But there is [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1247.9199999999998s)]
*  something I think to the fact that logic still has some power, the truth still has some power. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1254.08s)]
*  And this group of people who were just armed with zero arguments, just could not survive. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1260.7199999999998s)]
*  It definitely happened in the academic realm in 2017, a gentleman named Roland Fryer at Harvard [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1265.84s)]
*  University happens to be a black economist, published a paper titled an empirical difference [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1274.08s)]
*  in Gosh, what was the title, an empirical analysis of racial differences in police use of force. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1280.9599999999998s)]
*  He studied a number of cities across America to say, look, a lot of times when BLM makes their [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1287.1999999999998s)]
*  claims, they use anecdotal evidence in a country of 350 million people, they refer to one person [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1293.2s)]
*  or a second or a third, one of which happened to be Trayvon Martin, who was not killed by an actual [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1301.76s)]
*  officer. But there's just a number of anecdotes. So he goes, what we at Harvard need to do is come [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  up with empirical evidence to support these anecdotes, to which his conclusions were there [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1312.64s)]
*  was no difference in police use of force when it comes to shootings, when contextual factors were [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  taken into account. So just as I mentioned, yes, men are more likely to get killed, but men are also [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1325.68s)]
*  more likely to resist the police or initiate violent encounters with the police. In the [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1330.8s)]
*  academic world, this was a very big thing, which drastically increased the amount of insecurity [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1336.8799999999999s)]
*  among academics who were much less likely to start indoctrinating their kids and their students [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1342.72s)]
*  with all of this nonsense because they knew this guy was going around. So they ended up getting him [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1350.24s)]
*  fired over a completely fraudulent sexual harassment lawsuit. All of the text messages [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1354.96s)]
*  since he's been fired have been released. This guy is totally innocent. So I almost know that it was [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1361.3600000000001s)]
*  happening in the background, but you have other academics like Dr. Wilford Riley at Kentucky State [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1366.24s)]
*  University who said lynchings, absolutely terrible. A quarter of people lynched in American history [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1371.76s)]
*  were white. In 23 states, more whites were lynched than blacks. The biggest white lynching [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1379.76s)]
*  in American history after the Civil War was the 1891 New Orleans lynchings where all the victims [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1385.36s)]
*  were white. So something that was actually a result of mob violence was later seen through the lens of [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1392.4s)]
*  only something racial. Just like slavery, if you think the problem is the skin color, well, what's [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1399.76s)]
*  your objection to the slavery mentioned in ancient Mesopotamia in the code of Ernamu or the code of [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1406.32s)]
*  Hammurabi or Vladimir Zelensky enslaving people to fight a war against their will, kidnapping and [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1411.84s)]
*  conscripting soldiers to go die on the front lines when the average life expectancy in places like [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1417.6s)]
*  the Battle of Bakmut were four hours. They have so little that when all you focus on are arbitrary [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1422.72s)]
*  differences, you can never really get to the root of the issue. Not to mention the fact that Larry [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1429.6s)]
*  Coger, another academic, came out with a book titled Black Slave Owners in America 1790 to 1860. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1434.9599999999998s)]
*  This caused another uproar. So it seems like the academics had a significant amount of insecurity [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1441.36s)]
*  created in them. They stopped pushing it. Even when I was at Arizona State, I could see it actually [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1448.32s)]
*  dying down a little. So yeah, hopefully it is gone for good, but you never know. A lot of times [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1453.12s)]
*  when they're always pushing this racism nonsense, though, they'll always use the anecdotes. They [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1460.1599999999999s)]
*  never mentioned Justine Damon getting killed by a black Somali officer in Minnesota after she called [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1464.9599999999998s)]
*  911 to report an assault. They don't mention Ashley Babbitt, an armed woman getting killed by [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1470.8s)]
*  a black officer. Tony Timpa was actually getting suffocated to death on camera by the Dallas police [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1476.2399999999998s)]
*  for, I believe, 14 minutes. Same thing as George Floyd. It's all on camera. And they were never [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1482.56s)]
*  prosecuted. You have white men like Kelly Thomas getting beaten to death by the police, and this [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1487.76s)]
*  is never taken seriously. So yes, they have so little ground to stand on. I think it might be [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1492.56s)]
*  dying down, but they have poured so much gasoline in the minds of so many people throughout the last [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1499.44s)]
*  20 years that I think the right political arsonists could still come around and inflame the passions, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1506.1599999999999s)]
*  like Jasmine Crockett's always trying to do. Yeah, there's some of them out there who are still [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1511.84s)]
*  trying. And one of the things to me, I remember it's interesting to think about how much different [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1516.32s)]
*  mood the country's in right now. Your point is well taken. You never know what's going to happen [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1526.3999999999999s)]
*  in the future, and the foundation has been laid for this stuff. It could make a comeback. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1531.04s)]
*  But I just remember, even in our libertarian world, first of all, if you take, say, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1535.68s)]
*  Chase Oliver or someone like that, or Kamala Harris is the same way, but you just know, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1544.96s)]
*  if they were running in 2017, their message would have been so much woker than it was in 2024. It [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1551.1200000000001s)]
*  was almost like they were walking away from that stuff. They didn't exactly want to throw it under [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1558.72s)]
*  the bus because they don't want to piss off their own base either. But they're not running on this [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1562.8s)]
*  stuff as aggressively as they would have. I remember getting a lot of flak from libertarians [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1567.9199999999998s)]
*  in the summer of 2020 because I was so outspoken against the riots, which I just, again, it was [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1574.1599999999999s)]
*  stunning to me. It was like, we're libertarians because we believe in private property rights and [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1583.04s)]
*  voluntary peaceful interactions. And I see a mob destroying private property. What about that is [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1589.12s)]
*  supposed to at all jive with my worldview? But I remember making the point and really taking some [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1596.8799999999999s)]
*  heat for this. But I was like, look, of all of these, the Black Lives Matters kind of like poster [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1602.8799999999999s)]
*  boys, all of their cases that they love to talk about, many of which I'm pretty much on the side [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1608.8799999999999s)]
*  of this was messed up. Like it doesn't give you permission to go burn down the Wendy's. But like, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1614.72s)]
*  I do, you know, like I do, I don't think that cop should have sat on George Floyd's neck for nine [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1619.76s)]
*  minutes. And I certainly think the Breonna Taylor case was an outrage, but there was just not one [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1624.96s)]
*  shred of evidence that either of them were racial issues. There was never nothing. There was never [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1630.8s)]
*  even like a case presented as to why we think this happened because the officer was white. I mean, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1636.56s)]
*  even though all the guys around Derek Chauvin were like an Asian and a black guy and all that, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1643.52s)]
*  but it's not as if he said some, it's not like while he was doing it, he was like, yeah, you take [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1647.76s)]
*  that you black motherfucker. You know what I mean? Like it wasn't like there was like a racial aspect [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1653.28s)]
*  to it. It was just like, Oh, well, the victims are black and therefore this must be a racial issue. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1657.6s)]
*  And that just doesn't make any sense. It was just like on a very simple common sense test. Like if [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1663.36s)]
*  there was a bar fight down the street and it was a white guy got in a fight with a black guy, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1669.44s)]
*  you wouldn't just immediately go, well, it must've been racism. It's like, well, maybe they were [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1674.24s)]
*  fighting over a girl. Maybe one of them bumped into the other one. Maybe like there's a million [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1677.3600000000001s)]
*  different reasons why in the fact. And it's something was crazy that the official movement, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1681.04s)]
*  it seemed like never even had to present an argument as to like, well, this is why it's a [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1686.16s)]
*  racial issue. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1691.2s)]
*  sheath underwear. I've been telling you guys about them for years now. And I will tell you sheath [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1695.44s)]
*  underwear came on. It was almost four years ago when they came on as a sponsor and they sent me [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1699.8400000000001s)]
*  a couple pairs of their boxer briefs and I put them on and I was like, man, these are like the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1704.88s)]
*  best pair of underwear I've ever owned. So I got rid of the rest of my boxer briefs. I ordered a [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1708.88s)]
*  bunch more sheath underwear and I will tell you, I still have those pairs that they sent me when [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1713.28s)]
*  they first came on. I still wear them all the time. They still feel like new. If you love this show, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1717.6000000000001s)]
*  support our longtime sponsor sheath underwear. And while you're at it, get yourself the most [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1722.72s)]
*  comfortable pair of boxer briefs you will ever put on your body. Go check them out right now [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1727.28s)]
*  at sheath underwear dot com and make sure to use the promo code problem for 20% off your order. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1732.08s)]

*  let's get back into the show. Yeah, you would think that you look at the police and you say, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1744.64s)]
*  all right, they have the right to arrest citizens. Citizens don't have the right to walk up to cops [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1750.32s)]
*  and arrest them. They can, you know, stop and see if you're suspicious and maybe search through your [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1756.32s)]
*  car. You don't have the right to do that to them. They have the right to put you in jail if you [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1761.4399999999998s)]
*  violate one of their rules, but you don't have the right to do that to them. They have a monopoly on [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1765.9199999999998s)]
*  violence. People look at this and say, all right, they have a monopoly on violence. They give you [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1772.6399999999999s)]
*  orders. You must obey them. They're like, there's gotta be a racial aspect to this. It's like, do [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1777.76s)]
*  you think that same thing? There's a much more plausible explanation for these things. What [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1782.72s)]
*  Wilfred Riley did at Kentucky State University is commit the ultimate thought crime. And he [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1788.8799999999999s)]
*  basically says he has to sort of gradually introduce his students to this. He goes, look, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1794.08s)]
*  men are much more likely to commit violence against a person than a woman is. This is not me hating [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1799.44s)]
*  men, but statistically that's true. Whether it's murder, rape, kidnapping, the perpetrator [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1806.64s)]
*  tends to be male. As things are now, it roughly is about a 13 to one ratio when it comes to [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1812.16s)]
*  black on white violence, when it comes to rape, murder, assault, burglary, robbery, 13 times, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1819.2800000000002s)]
*  every 13 times a black person does it to a white person. A white person statistically will do it [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1827.2s)]
*  one time to a black person. This 13 to one ratio is what got him a lot of heat. This was in a book [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1832.0s)]
*  titled Lies My Liberal Teacher Told Me. But this is a reality that people need to know about. So [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1838.88s)]
*  when they see disparities in prison, they don't flip out. Imagine you have mentioned that you [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1844.08s)]
*  have a son on your show. Would you want your son to be raised to just say 95% of people killed by [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1849.12s)]
*  the police are male? You are just discriminated against because you're a boy. So don't bother [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1856.8s)]
*  working hard. Don't bother showing up on time. Don't go to a job and ask for on the job training. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1862.6399999999999s)]
*  That's all buying into the system. You need to start a male lives matter movement. Anytime a man [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1867.6s)]
*  is hurt, you need to start organizing with your friends, rioting, looting, focus on protesting a [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1872.8s)]
*  lot. Everything else is just buying into the system. You would be hurting your own son doing that. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1878.72s)]
*  That is how Democrats are trying to raise black America today. Even when all of these statistics, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1883.52s)]
*  not to mention competing anecdotes, are completely against their narrative. That's the reality that [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1889.6s)]
*  they're just unwilling to address. And that's why I'm really hoping to see an end to wokeism [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1895.68s)]
*  when it comes to disparities between groups, our proof of discrimination. I'm really hoping that [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1902.08s)]
*  this goes away. Yeah. And of course, because it really is, well, first of all, it's incoherent, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1907.04s)]
*  obviously, as you've kind of very beautifully laid it out. But it's also, as you mentioned, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1914.3999999999999s)]
*  as Lou Rockwell was getting at, it's an attack on liberty. It's an attack on a free society. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1923.04s)]
*  Because even though the government doesn't actually bring any more equality, in fact, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1928.48s)]
*  you could argue that they bring a more drastic inequality because they have a higher authority [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1934.08s)]
*  than anybody else. They have more power. So inherently, it's more unequal, at least the [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1940.0s)]
*  balance of power is. But the solution is always more government intervention. The solution is [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1945.28s)]
*  always some type of government problem. And as we know, with any degree of freedom, it brings [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1952.24s)]
*  disparate outcomes. That's the very nature of freedom is that we can choose different paths [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1960.08s)]
*  and then we're going to end up in different places. And there's no, like why we would ever have [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1967.2s)]
*  the expectation of equality in outcomes makes absolutely no sense or equality of opportunity, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1972.8799999999999s)]
*  for that matter. It just makes no sense. It's like the truth is that, you know, we have lots of [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1980.08s)]
*  Irish people go into being firefighters and lots of Asian people go into engineering and lots of [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1986.88s)]
*  Jewish people go into like the literary works or banking or whatever. It's like these are just [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=1994.24s)]
*  we see all around us that there are these different groups of people that tend to go into [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2001.8400000000001s)]
*  different areas. And it just seems like why would we there's something really anti-human [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2006.4s)]
*  about all of it, because it's like, oh, so you want to extinguish our differences. But that's [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2014.08s)]
*  the beauty of life is in differences. The beauty of life is that you are not just a carbon copy of me. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2020.24s)]
*  Like even two guys like me and you who have very similar political views, what would the point of [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2026.48s)]
*  me having you on my show be if you didn't have a different mind than me and kind of add something [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2031.04s)]
*  else and have some other information in your head that I didn't have in mind? And then we like it's [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2035.1999999999998s)]
*  so anti-human to oppose. It's essentially a war on uniqueness. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2040.3999999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't even properly reward the ambition which any sane society would like to reward. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2047.6s)]
*  In civil rights rhetoric or reality, Thomas Sowell uses the example of Japanese Americans [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2054.08s)]
*  who came to America, didn't speak English, and by 1945 they are in Franklin Roosevelt's internment [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2058.7999999999997s)]
*  camps from his executive order. By 1959, they had incomes that equaled white incomes and by 1969, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2065.28s)]
*  they were earning 33% more than the average American family because they are extraordinarily [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2072.5600000000004s)]
*  ambitious even today. Whites do not earn more than all the other groups. You have Vietnamese [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2078.5600000000004s)]
*  Americans, Pakistani Americans, even Nigerian Americans, Filipino Americans, Chinese Americans, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2084.0s)]
*  Taiwanese Americans. I believe according to the 2018 U.S. Census where I last looked at these [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2090.16s)]
*  numbers, whites are like 11th or 12th on the list of ethnicities when it comes to income. So you're [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2094.96s)]
*  not even rewarding the very minorities who've engaged in very ambitious activities in the first [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2100.72s)]
*  place. So it's so detrimental. It's not just like this homicidal of, I hate these people, I want to [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2106.3999999999996s)]
*  push them down. It's even like suicidal. I don't even want to be part of a society that rewards [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2113.2s)]
*  good behavior. Those people can go somewhere else. We don't have meritocracy here. You're even [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2118.64s)]
*  hurting yourself in the long run. So that is what I see as the ultimate case against the woke racist [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2123.04s)]
*  left and the woke economic left. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. All right, so let's move over now to [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2130.4s)]
*  this term the woke right. Now I will say, I've mentioned this on the show before, I do think [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2138.0s)]
*  I was an early adopter of this term. I started using this like, you know, I had made the point [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2144.7200000000003s)]
*  I think substantially before October 7th. I think that, you know, I remember saying this with friends, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2152.0s)]
*  but I think I definitely remember at least there was one Ron DeSantis press conference that we [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2159.12s)]
*  covered on the show. This has got to be at least a couple years ago where he was just going off about [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2165.2000000000003s)]
*  anti-Semitism and protecting Jewish students and Jewish kids from dealing with anti-Semitism. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2170.96s)]
*  And I was like, man, this was my first kind of like thing where I was like, isn't it interesting [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2178.48s)]
*  when the topic of Israel or Jews comes up that these crusaders against wokeism almost immediately [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2183.84s)]
*  borrow not just like their talking points, their entire set of analytical tools, if you can even [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2193.12s)]
*  call it that, but it's like the way we are going to talk about this is, you know, this constant [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2200.4799999999996s)]
*  concept creep between legitimate criticism, bigotry, and violence. They all kind of get mixed together [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2208.16s)]
*  in one bag. Then we are going to, you know, pretend that a group of people who are not [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2218.32s)]
*  marginalized or victimized in society are under this constant threat. We're going to invoke, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2226.32s)]
*  you know, injustices in history to explain why the current, we're going to have speech laws, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2235.6800000000003s)]
*  we're going to have our own set of political correctness. I was like, everything about this [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2240.96s)]
*  just seems to be like the exact same thing. And then after October 7th, it was just like obvious [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2244.72s)]
*  to me. This is their entire argument. You know, it's all wokeism. And then a different group of [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2248.56s)]
*  people, you know, I guess notably Constantine Kassin, who I was just arguing with on Twitter, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2254.16s)]
*  James Lindsay, who, you know, full disclosure, I don't get along with very well. And some of [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2261.3599999999997s)]
*  these guys, they started using the term woke right to attack Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens and [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2265.9199999999996s)]
*  Daryl Cooper and myself and some others. So what do we, at this point, I almost feel like the waters [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2272.64s)]
*  have been muddied a little bit, but what are your thoughts on the woke right? Who fits into that [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2279.2s)]
*  category? And how would you assess it? So I want to start with James Lindsay's definition on [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2285.04s)]
*  trigonometry, which he gave to Constantine Kassin, which Kassin appeared to agree with. Here's what [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2293.44s)]
*  Lindsay says. There's the philosophical deeper aspect. Why woke? What does it mean? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2298.08s)]
*  Woke up to a structural politics that marginalizes people like me, and we need to band together in [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2304.4s)]
*  solidarity, no enemies to the right in order to be able to create a powerful enough oppressed [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2310.3199999999997s)]
*  coalition to flip over the power structure by putting ourselves at the center and claiming [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2315.92s)]
*  power for ourselves. This is explicitly woke, having a critical consciousness about the way [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2321.7599999999998s)]
*  the world is organized. The reason that this is such a horrible definition, even though I do like [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2327.68s)]
*  James Lindsay to a very high degree, he's been on my show twice and him and I got along, but after [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  reading this, this actually applies to quite literally every single political movement that [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2337.6s)]
*  I have come across, even researching books like the origins of war, where there were people in [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2343.2s)]
*  these primitive societies who felt like they were getting a raw deal. They resisted their, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2349.6s)]
*  there's chapters of the Bible where it's like these people thought that they were getting [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2354.6400000000003s)]
*  mistreated by this Pharaoh and they did, you know, thus and so they were trying to increase the [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2359.5200000000004s)]
*  amount of power they had in opposition to people over them. So I just don't see that this is a [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2365.28s)]
*  definition. It's like, well, people on the woke right believe that the sun is really hot. Okay, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2370.88s)]
*  yes, they do, but that applies to everyone else. So it's not a unique definition. What I'm looking [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2376.6400000000003s)]
*  for when it comes to the woke right is the woke concept of ignoring very plausible explanations [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2382.0s)]
*  and primarily focusing on the potential motives of the person presenting the evidence. So when I say [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2389.36s)]
*  the Jewish Chronicle released a document published by the Hamas media office called [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2397.04s)]
*  operation, a lax a flood, our narrative, and it basically says we are opposing the Israeli [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2402.8s)]
*  government, the Zionist crime organization, I believe they call it because of the blockade [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2410.32s)]
*  they've had on us since 2004, the crimes going back to the Ergon, Stern and Haganah, which have [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2416.48s)]
*  killed not only Palestinians, but if you look at the SS Patriot, even the original Zionist organizations [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2421.84s)]
*  were targeting Jews trying to flee Palestine because they wanted to say the world is unsafe, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2428.1600000000003s)]
*  except for Israel for us Jews, the world is unsafe, except for Israel. So everyone has to come here. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2434.1600000000003s)]
*  This was a guy named Zviab Tinsky's plan in a paper called the iron wall written, I want to say [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2439.68s)]
*  in the 1920s. He wanted to say the one thing we want is the one thing the Arabs don't want [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2447.04s)]
*  Jewish immigration. That's what we got to focus on. So these groups are trying to do that. So this [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2452.24s)]
*  document from Hamas mentions that they also mentioned the number of mowing of the lawn [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2456.72s)]
*  operations. They mentioned things like operation cast lead operation pillar of defense where a [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2462.48s)]
*  number of Palestinians have been killed. They say, well, we're not subject to fair trials. If you [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2468.0s)]
*  look at the entire list, it's nothing about they don't obey the Quran. We hate the Talmud. You know, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2473.12s)]
*  we hate Hollywood, which is run by the it's none of that. It's all criticisms of what the Zionist [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2479.04s)]
*  government has done to them. And all of these explanations are things we would obviously see [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2485.76s)]
*  as illegitimate if done to us, or even if they were done to another country. Israel gets a 20 [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2491.76s)]
*  year blockade on Gaza. But we say that even if China potentially threatens a blockade on Taiwan, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2496.88s)]
*  we might have to go to nuclear war. So there are very plausible explanations for things. But the [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2503.44s)]
*  woke right that Constantine Kissens, the Douglas Murray's the bench of heroes completely ignore [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2509.52s)]
*  that and say, well, you must be an anti Semite. We're saying, you know, this issue in Ukraine, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2513.84s)]
*  this war, according to the former US Ambassador to Russia, William Burns, is more or less taking [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2520.32s)]
*  place as a cause of result of NATO expansion, just as we wouldn't allow Soviet missiles in Cuba. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2526.48s)]
*  They're not going to allow NATO on their border. You Wow, I can't believe you like Putin. Wow, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2531.84s)]
*  you're against democracy. This is just the typical emotional response. Even some time ago, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2538.48s)]
*  if you said, you know, this mass murder campaign in Vietnam is unjustified, and we shouldn't be [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2545.84s)]
*  conscripting soldiers to fight into it. Well, you must be a servant of the communists. It's like, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2550.2400000000002s)]
*  not necessarily at all. In fact, this could empower the communists because it makes the [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2555.84s)]
*  capitalist West look totally evil. Or if you say, you know, bin Laden said in a Harvard [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2559.68s)]
*  publication titled Al Qaeda in its own words, bin Laden said that 9 11 was happened as a result of [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2567.36s)]
*  sanctions on Iraq in the 90s support for Israel, especially in Lebanon and against the [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2575.6s)]
*  Palestinians and occupation of the land of the two sanctuaries and Mecca and Medina, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2580.4s)]
*  and to which the woke right will say things like, Wow, you're saying we deserve 9 11. You're saying [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2586.4s)]
*  you hate America. Anytime you criticize a law, they say, Oh, you must hate the cops. You must [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2592.32s)]
*  hate the country that you live in. So it's all boring and predictable. And this is what I'm [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2597.2000000000003s)]
*  saying is the key to wokeness, ignoring very plausible explanations and replacing them with [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2602.32s)]
*  questioning the motives. And we can get into the kiss and issue specifically later if you want to [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2608.88s)]
*  specify. Well, I just want to you know, it's funny because I've talked about this issue before, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2614.4s)]
*  and I think you've honed in on something that I wasn't exactly precisely maybe as focused on [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2618.32s)]
*  as I should be. But even as you're saying it to me, you know, it's like, okay, first off, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2623.92s)]
*  let me just say it like, look, I completely agree with you. This is what I said about it at the time, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2628.48s)]
*  the James Lindsay and forget whatever me and him have insulted each other on Twitter, but I have [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2632.32s)]
*  thick skin, I could let that go. And we could grab a beer tomorrow. Like, I don't really care. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2637.04s)]
*  It's just look, objectively, I'm looking at the argument and his definition, like you said, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2641.04s)]
*  it fits every political grid. It's like a woken to a structure that was unfair to us. And so we want [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2646.16s)]
*  to get together and put ourselves in power. Like, like, why that's politics. That's literally what [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2652.64s)]
*  all of it is. It's it's you might be like, well, you see, what makes them the woke right is that [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2659.36s)]
*  they want to run candidates for office. And their plan is to raise money and garner votes [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2663.36s)]
*  in order to put themselves in a position of power where they can implement policies that they deem [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2669.04s)]
*  as preferable. Yeah, that's, that's all. And then I see this just like the way the tactics are used. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2674.0s)]
*  It's like you have this very broad definition. You say the players are Tucker Carlson and Candace [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2679.6s)]
*  Owens and Daryl Cooper. And then all of a sudden you see them start bringing up like Nick Fuentes [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2685.6s)]
*  or someone else and then using that as proof that these other guys are woke right, even though like [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2692.56s)]
*  there's a huge gap between the views of this group and the views of that group. And it's just, it's [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2697.92s)]
*  all incoherent to me. And I will say much like when you're dealing with the woke left, it's like, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2703.44s)]
*  look, the claim is not that bigotry doesn't exist or that bigotry couldn't possibly be the reason [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2709.36s)]
*  for something happening. Like it is not impossible that Derek Chauvin could have just been looking [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2716.24s)]
*  for a black guy to kneel on his neck and happen to find George Floyd. But the argument we're making [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2723.04s)]
*  is like, you have to present some type of evidence for that before I'm just going to believe it for [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2729.4399999999996s)]
*  no reason. And so let's look at the evidence and let's also consider what could be alternative or [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2734.24s)]
*  more likely, you know, answers to this question, as you mentioned, like, okay, these police have [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2739.52s)]
*  these enormous amount of powers and they can wield them with impunity. That seems like a plot. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2744.72s)]
*  And so I've just, I've found myself as I'm arguing this the other day, even as, as you're saying it, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2748.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm like thinking about this before even the Constantine argument, were there these people? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2753.04s)]
*  So Ian Carroll, are you familiar with Ian? Yeah. So he just went on Joe Rogan show a few days ago. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2757.3599999999997s)]
*  This created quite a stir. And I'm like arguing with people and they're like, well, look, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2763.9199999999996s)]
*  clearly he hates Jews because look, he's got all these conspiracies where at the top of the [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2770.0s)]
*  conspiracies are the Israelis. And by the way, he's put out some things that like, I'm not, so I'm not [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2775.2s)]
*  at all sold on Israel did 9 11. And it certainly wouldn't like really conflict with my worldview. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2780.88s)]
*  If that was the case, it's not like some, I'm just, I've seen the evidence. It's like, actually, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2786.48s)]
*  I don't think it's as strong as you guys think. You know, the major pieces of evidence I seem to [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2791.52s)]
*  say are what's, what's dubbed the dancing Israelis, which aren't, they weren't actually dancing, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2795.92s)]
*  but that's what they've come to be known. I thought Max Blumenthal's piece on that [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2800.6400000000003s)]
*  pretty much led you know, like ads, it's just not really that strong of an argument. There's a bit [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2804.7200000000003s)]
*  of a like, huh, there, but not really, we don't really know that this was any proof that the [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2809.2000000000003s)]
*  Silverstein got a big insurance policy on the world trade center. You know, the issue Netanyahu said [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2815.6800000000003s)]
*  something about the world trade center coming down. The problem is I think it might be an age [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2822.8s)]
*  thing. Sometimes, you know, sometimes like, I think a 27 year old looks at that and goes, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2827.44s)]
*  no one could have possibly known that the world trade center would have been a terrorist target [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2831.2000000000003s)]
*  before 9 11. The problem is that the same guys had tried to knock down the trade center in 93. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2835.52s)]
*  It was the most high profile target for terrorism in the world. It wasn't that crazy of a thought [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2841.6000000000004s)]
*  to mention the twin towers coming down when it had already been attempted. And I'm just saying, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2848.2400000000002s)]
*  I look at it and I objectively go, I don't, I don't actually think you have a strong, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2852.64s)]
*  certainly not a strong enough case that I would be comfortable like I am with other being like, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2856.4s)]
*  this is what happened here. Okay, like we can say this definitively. I just don't feel that way about [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2861.04s)]
*  it. Okay, but that being said, so I could disagree with this take and someone else could have the [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2865.04s)]
*  theory that they think Israel was behind 9 11. I could disagree with them. But to conclude from [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2870.4s)]
*  that, that you must hate Jewish people. It's like, well, wait a minute, there's all these other [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2875.92s)]
*  possible like reasons why you might think that number one, maybe you were just more persuaded by [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2880.32s)]
*  the evidence than I was. Maybe you've seen some evidence that I haven't seen yet. Maybe you've [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2885.92s)]
*  seen the same evidence and you just weren't quite as scrupulous as I was being like, no, I have a [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2890.1600000000003s)]
*  higher bar of what meets the, I believe this actually happened test. Maybe the reason why so [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2894.32s)]
*  many people are interested in conspiracy theories these days is because there's been so many real [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2899.44s)]
*  ones and the government lies to you about everything. We just lived through the country [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2904.96s)]
*  being shut down over a bullshit conspiracy. So maybe people are more open to them. And maybe the [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2908.96s)]
*  reason why people are suspect suspicious of Israel is because, well, I don't know, we're currently, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2914.0s)]
*  you know, funding and arming a war for them. That is not at all in our national interest. We've [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2919.36s)]
*  fought, you know, like all of these wars in this region of the world, clearly taking out one enemy [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2923.84s)]
*  of Israel after the other and people start to get, it's just, there are so many other explanations [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2929.36s)]
*  that are so much more likely. And then when you couple that with the fact that this Ian Carroll [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2935.76s)]
*  guy goes on Rogan and like 12 times disclaims, I'm not saying it's the Jews. I got nothing against [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2941.1200000000003s)]
*  Jews. Jews are regular people just like me and you, man. And I'm cool with you. I got no problem. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2947.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm saying it's this small group of people. I think like when you couple it all together, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2951.76s)]
*  it's the same. It's literally the same thing as going like, well, why do you think Asian Americans [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2955.76s)]
*  are more successful than Puerto Ricans? It must be racism. It's like, no, there's like all these [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2961.52s)]
*  other like possible. And by the way, I'm not saying it's impossible that someone could say [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2967.52s)]
*  they're not bigoted against Jews, but they really are. I'm just saying, why are we jumping to that [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2972.56s)]
*  conclusion and pretending that you have a certainty that this person is a bigot? Hey guys, let's take [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2976.88s)]
*  a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is my Patriot Supply. Such an important [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2983.28s)]
*  sponsor. I love that they're on board with us because they're the company that I trust to keep [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2988.08s)]
*  my family prepared. Look, we've all seen what can happen when a crisis hits and we've all seen how [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2992.56s)]
*  quick those grocery store shelves can empty. Don't be on the wrong side of that. You want to always [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=2997.52s)]
*  know that your family is protected when the next crisis emerges. That's why I trust my Patriot Supply [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3003.52s)]
*  to help prepare before the next crisis. Order their four week emergency food supplies today [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3008.7999999999997s)]
*  and get four 72 hour food kits completely free. That's almost two weeks of bonus meals at no cost. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3015.12s)]
*  Each of these kits offer 2000 calories per day of delicious, easy to prepare meals that last up to [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3022.7999999999997s)]
*  25 years. That's real peace of mind. No last minute panic, no empty shelves, just knowing you're [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3028.88s)]
*  covered. Stock up today before this deal disappears because when an emergency hits, food will be the [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3035.12s)]
*  first thing to go. Go to my website, preparewithsmith.com to claim your kit plus an extra [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3040.4s)]
*  12 days of free food. That's preparewithsmith.com. All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3046.0s)]
*  It just happened the other day when Kissen had said, oh yeah, well, Darryl Cooper, he's had the [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3053.04s)]
*  opportunity to debate Andrew Roberts, someone I've been begging to debate by the way. And you know, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3059.6s)]
*  he didn't take that and Cooper has used David Irving as his source. Now, this is the ultimate [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3065.12s)]
*  attempt to poison the well. This is a perfect SJW woke tactic where they say person A, well, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3072.4s)]
*  he's loosely correlated to person B and person B can be dismissed. So therefore I've dismissed [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3079.8399999999997s)]
*  the argument of person A. That is a totally woke tactic. It's like, you know what another [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3085.68s)]
*  citation could be for someone you looked into and said, well, this doesn't all add up. You could read [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3093.6000000000004s)]
*  Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war on September 3rd of 1939. He says, we told the [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3100.0800000000004s)]
*  Germans to get out of Danzig, Poland by this hour. They have not therefore on behalf of Polish [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3105.36s)]
*  independence, we are going to wage a war on Germany. But then the Soviets invaded Poland [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3110.6400000000003s)]
*  two weeks later on September 17th, 1939, and they didn't declare war. Maybe that could raise some [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3116.6400000000003s)]
*  eyebrows. Maybe the fact that the war ended with 7 million dead Poles and Poland under Bolshevik [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3121.92s)]
*  occupation. Maybe that could be a reason why someone questions the validity of the second [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3126.96s)]
*  world war, Mr. Kissin, not just because, well, there might be a connection to David Irving, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3132.7200000000003s)]
*  who has said good things about national socialism. That's much more plausible. How about you could [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3137.84s)]
*  use Winston Churchill as your source for being skeptical of the second world war. Churchill wrote [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3142.88s)]
*  a book titled The World Crisis, 1911 to 1918. So let's take it out of the second world war and [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3148.56s)]
*  just look at Churchill when he's operating in a war that today almost had very few defenders. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3154.48s)]
*  Barbara Tuckman will defend the first world war, but everyone more or less looks at it and says, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3160.56s)]
*  well, this was a mass death, which really could, I mean, as bad as Kaiser Wilhelm was, he was better [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3165.12s)]
*  than what followed. So maybe we should have just tolerated that. In Churchill's book, The World [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3170.2400000000002s)]
*  Crisis, he said that the policy that he enacted as first lord of the Admiralty was a deliberate [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3174.96s)]
*  starvation of the population of Germany to push people into submission. He uses the word submission. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3182.4s)]
*  Men, women and children wounded and sound into submission, the whole population of Germany. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3192.4s)]
*  I don't remember the exact quote, but I know it's on page 672 of that book. He says this is a policy [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3198.64s)]
*  among the civilian population of Germany. A very pro Churchill historian, Martin Gilbert, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3204.32s)]
*  said that there were roughly 700,000 deaths as a cause or result of this blockade. Meanwhile, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3209.92s)]
*  Kaiser Wilhelm went to the Netherlands to retire and live the rest of his life. So it could be that [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3215.2000000000003s)]
*  we feel bad for the poor German civilian population. That could be an explanation. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3220.88s)]
*  And then in the second world war, Churchill writes another book titled The Gathering Storm, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3226.56s)]
*  where he says, the human tragedy reaches its climax that after all the exertions and sacrifices [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3230.24s)]
*  of the righteous cause, we have found neither peace nor security and we lie in the grip of even [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3236.64s)]
*  worse perils than those we have surmounted. Meaning we fought the war against national socialism and [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3242.0s)]
*  now the Bolsheviks control East Germany to Vladivostok and have a loose alliance with Mao in China. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3247.2s)]
*  And they have bases, you know, very close to North Korea, later expanding into Vietnam. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3254.88s)]
*  So you could use Chamberlain and Churchill as your sources, not David Irving. There are people in [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3259.84s)]
*  Churchill's cabinet, Charles Percy Snow, who was a science advisor, who gave a series of lectures [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3264.88s)]
*  at Harvard titled Science and Government, where he said, this was in 1961, he said, the paper on [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3270.8s)]
*  bombing by Frederick Lindemann, who was known as by Count Sherwell, went out to Churchill's cabinet. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3277.36s)]
*  And we found that we could use bombs to make half of the German population homeless, especially in [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3284.32s)]
*  cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants. So you could use him as a source. J.M. Spate said, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3291.36s)]
*  we were the ones who authorized the initial bombing of civilians in German cities. And we knew that [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3297.28s)]
*  this would bring the war into Britain, but it was necessary because his book is titled Bombing [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3304.88s)]
*  Vindicated. So he's saying that the sooner you start bombing, the sooner you can get them to [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3309.76s)]
*  wave the white flag and surrender. So you have people, this was the air principal secretary of [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3314.48s)]
*  the ministry saying, yes, we started the bombing, we should be proud of it. You have Frederick Lindemann [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3319.84s)]
*  himself giving a memorandum to Winston Churchill in May of 1940. This was published in a book by [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3325.36s)]
*  Max Hastings titled Bomber Command, where he explicitly says, we're aiming at the civilian [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3331.76s)]
*  population. That's a very plausible explanation. Another source you could use is Charles de Gaulle, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3336.96s)]
*  who was calling the shots for the French government in exile. In his memoirs, Charles de Gaulle says, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3342.7200000000003s)]
*  I asked Winston Churchill why he was so interested in having the Germans bomb Britain, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3350.16s)]
*  and Churchill told me that once the Americans see the bombing of Oxford and Coventry, the Americans [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3356.64s)]
*  will have to come into the war. These are totally legitimate sources that you could be using as [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3362.56s)]
*  opposed to David Irving. And then there's another one, Martin Gilbert, who was the Churchill historian [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3368.7999999999997s)]
*  before Andrew Roberts became the Churchill historian. And he said, Churchill told Londonderry in 1935, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3374.56s)]
*  we're going to have to go to war with Germany because they're the biggest power in Europe, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3381.6s)]
*  just as we would take on the Spanish if they got too powerful, just as we've taken on the French [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3385.84s)]
*  Empire or the French monarchy, just as we would take on any other nation. It looks like Germany [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3390.72s)]
*  is the one we're going to have to oppose now. But previously, Churchill said in an article titled [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3395.9199999999996s)]
*  Zionism versus Bolshevism in the early 1920s, that the Bolsheviks were going to be the ones they might [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3401.7599999999998s)]
*  have to go after because he saw them as the competitor, potentially the encroaching competitor [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3407.2799999999997s)]
*  on the continent at the time. All of these reasonable explanations and all Kissin has to respond [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3413.3599999999997s)]
*  is you probably think the Holocaust didn't happen. It is so pathetic. And then one last one, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3418.56s)]
*  the Second World War. Henry Stimson wrote a diary. This was the Secretary of War. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3426.7999999999997s)]
*  And in 1946, there was the Pearl Harbor investigation. If you look at Stimson's [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3432.24s)]
*  diary entry on November 25th of 1941, two weeks before Pearl Harbor, he said, we met with the [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3437.2799999999997s)]
*  president on Monday. We had discussions that the Japanese were planning to attack us as soon as [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3444.72s)]
*  next Monday. The question was how we could convince them to commit the first overt act of war against [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3451.8399999999997s)]
*  us in order to justify intervention. I mean, we're quoting people who are in positions to know these [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3458.64s)]
*  things. That is totally legitimate and has nothing to do with us denying the Holocaust, hating Jews, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3464.9599999999996s)]
*  or loving David Irving. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3470.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, this is, I mean, it's part of the reason why I found Pat Buchanan's book so compelling, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3471.76s)]
*  Churchill, Hitler and the unnecessary war. And what's interesting about it is when there is [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3479.28s)]
*  the response of like, oh, what, so what are you saying? The Holocaust didn't happen. And I'm sure [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3484.64s)]
*  there are people out there who are saying that I think they're wrong. But the whole point that [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3489.28s)]
*  Pat Buchanan's making is like, no, I'm saying it did happen. I'm saying it happened in the middle [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3494.48s)]
*  of this war. And it's just hard, I think just like on almost the most common sense litmus test to go, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3500.88s)]
*  okay, so the results of the war were first of all, as you mentioned, British entry into the war, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3508.08s)]
*  the official justification was to protect the independence of Poland. Okay. The results of the [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3515.28s)]
*  war were the biggest bloodbath in human history, the Holocaust and Joseph Stalin taking over half [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3521.84s)]
*  of Europe. And I mean, when those are the results, it's just pretty easy for someone to go like, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3528.32s)]
*  maybe an alternative scenario would have been better. Like maybe playing things a little bit [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3535.36s)]
*  differently could have led to a preferable outcome. Now I understand to some degree, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3541.44s)]
*  and this is partially because of how evil the Nazis were and partially because of years of [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3545.84s)]
*  indoctrination, but I understand people immediately going like, well, if the Nazis had survived, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3550.96s)]
*  it would have been a worse outcome. You know, like if the Nazi regime was still standing and [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3555.68s)]
*  Adolf Hitler was still alive, then that's a worse outcome. It's just like, that's not so self [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3559.92s)]
*  evidently clear. And I'm not saying it's a great outcome for Adolf Hitler to still be alive and [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3565.04s)]
*  the Nazi regime to have continued. But like, let's say hypothetically, the 60 million people didn't [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3570.7200000000003s)]
*  die who died in that war. Let's say hypothetically, a deal could have been worked out to get the Jews [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3575.44s)]
*  out of there. Let's say hypothetically, the Soviet Union didn't take over all of Eastern Europe. It's [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3581.84s)]
*  not so obvious, you know, it's not so obvious that there isn't a path that could have been, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3587.76s)]
*  or there isn't policies that could have been pursued that would have led to a better path. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3594.16s)]
*  Now, by the way, so with the Constantin thing, because I want to just do this before we wrap up, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3599.2000000000003s)]
*  like, the thing I was arguing with him about was Darrell Cooper also, you know, it started with [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3604.4s)]
*  that, what's his name? Niall, the guy Scott Horton debated, Niall Ferguson called Darrell Cooper [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3609.6s)]
*  a Nazi apologist. I took issue with that and insulted him a little bit. I feel like, you know, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3617.12s)]
*  I'm sticking up for a friend who's unfairly being smeared. And then Constantin was like, no, he is a [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3621.76s)]
*  Nazi apologist. And so me and him started arguing. And I was like, yeah, but dude, like, come on. I [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3626.2400000000002s)]
*  mean, he's just not like, I don't know. Look at the guy's work. He's not a Nazi apologist. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3631.44s)]
*  And so what Constantin's thrown at me, again, it reminded me of kind of, you know, a lot of this [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3636.4s)]
*  stuff we've been talking about with the woke on the left and the right, assuming the motivations [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3641.12s)]
*  must be this one thing. This is the only motivation that could lead you to this place. And it was [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3646.64s)]
*  really amazing to me, especially because I think Constantin is still well, Trigonometry is a pretty [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3651.76s)]
*  big podcast, but at least at a point, what he was most known for was this speech where that he gave [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3656.32s)]
*  eviscerating, wokeism left wokeism. And it was beautiful. I mean, it was like one of the most [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3662.96s)]
*  eloquent and devastating speeches against wokeism you'll ever see. You could, if you Google [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3668.88s)]
*  Constantin Oxford woke, you'll find it real quick. It's got millions and millions of views. Great [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3673.92s)]
*  speech. And I'm like, Hey, so how are you that guy? And then we're still having, and his argument [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3678.56s)]
*  to me is he's like, well, look, Daryl Cooper posted a picture with a mug, you know, like with [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3683.92s)]
*  it, with Nazi imagery on it. And he posted the thing about a Nazi, you know, Hitler marching on [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3690.56s)]
*  Paris being preferable to like fat trans men in dresses or whatever. And that, you know, he's got, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3696.0s)]
*  and then, and, and so, and then he brings up the fact that he goes, he goes, also, he said Churchill [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3702.4s)]
*  was the true villain of, of the war. And I was like, arguing with him and I'm like, okay, well, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3708.56s)]
*  first of all, on your first point, what he said was, okay, so I say this to kind of rib my friends [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3713.28s)]
*  and I'm saying this in general, I'm being hyperbolic, but I like to say to him that [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3721.2000000000003s)]
*  Churchill was the real villain of world war two. And he goes, now I'm not saying he committed the [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3725.76s)]
*  most atrocities or he had the most blood on his hand necessarily, but here's why I think he's [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3730.1600000000003s)]
*  really the real villain. And it's like, okay, well then look, if we're being fair here and we're not [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3734.7200000000003s)]
*  being woke zealots about this, instead of just like, Ooh, I got red meat. Like here's my conclusion. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3739.12s)]
*  Let me work backward from that. I was like, why can't you guys ever include that in your retelling [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3745.04s)]
*  of the story? And then he responded to me and you could go look this up. This is on Twitter. He goes, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3750.4s)]
*  dude, you're telling me that he said that on Tucker Carlson in order to rib a friend and that he was [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3755.52s)]
*  being hyperbolic. Well, he still said it. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, I'm saying that on [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3760.24s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, he said like, I'm not saying he did this to rib a friend being hyperbolic and then [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3765.52s)]
*  just said this thing. I was like, no, that's what he said on Tucker Carlson that to rib my friend, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3771.52s)]
*  I use hyperbole and I say this. And so we're going back and forth on this. And then I'm just [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3776.32s)]
*  talking about like, I'm like, wait, he shit posted like a time or two. Like this is, this just sounds [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3780.96s)]
*  like what, like, first of all, why do you have to, as I put it on Twitter, I go, why do you have to [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3785.84s)]
*  very fine people on both sides him? Why do you have to tend this thing that's on tape that anyone [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3791.04s)]
*  can go back and watch? Like it really is strikingly similar to me to them saying Trump said there's [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3797.28s)]
*  very fine people on both sides. And it's like, dude, it's on to you can go back and listen to [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3802.32s)]
*  what he said. Same with Darrell Cooper on Tucker Carlson show. And I was like, okay, so on in your [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3807.28s)]
*  corner you have that he made some off color jokes that he shit posted a time or two. And then I [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3813.52s)]
*  ultimately said to Constantine, and this is where we stopped the interaction is that I went fine. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3819.04s)]
*  Look, you're not convinced by me. Take my non woke challenge. Okay. And here's my non woke challenge. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3824.56s)]
*  Listen to the first 30 minutes of fear and loathing in the new Jerusalem. And then listen to the 30 [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3831.36s)]
*  minutes that he did in the addendum piece after it about the suffering of Jews during World War II. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3837.12s)]
*  I go just listen to it's an hour combined. Listen to those two half hours. And you tell me, is it [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3843.76s)]
*  possible? Like is it conceivably possible that a Jew hating Nazi apologist could have possibly [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3849.92s)]
*  ever made that content? Like how can you square that circle together? How is it possible? That [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3859.2000000000003s)]
*  is the one thing that you could you could always count on any Jew hating Nazi apologist would never [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3864.7200000000003s)]
*  tell you about the individual suffering of Jewish people who had nothing to do with this [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3871.04s)]
*  bigger cabal and we're just totally fucked over. And just like so and this is Darrell's superpower [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3875.52s)]
*  really is that he's just like the most intensely empathetic person. So this is what people love [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3880.8s)]
*  about his work. It's all just like, oh my God, put yourself in that guy's shoes. Imagine you're here [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3886.56s)]
*  as this mob of people is ripping your kids and your wife apart and beating you to death and you [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3891.36s)]
*  just got to watch it all and you're powerless. And it's just and then he just responded with like, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3895.68s)]
*  I've seen it. I've listened to it and I still convinced. And once he said that, I was like, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3899.92s)]
*  well, I mean, if you're, you know, if you could, if you could listen to that and not just be shaken [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3903.52s)]
*  of any feeling that like this is okay. So in my, on my corner, I have here is this guy's work that [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3908.7200000000003s)]
*  he put out by his own free will where he's deeply empathetic to the suffering of Jews during the [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3915.84s)]
*  second world war. And in your corner you have he posted something provocative on Twitter once [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3922.48s)]
*  what are we even like what it's like arguing with a woke leftist who's like that guy's a racist [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3929.6s)]
*  because he told a joke and I was like, well, you know, he's got a black wife and three black kids, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3936.24s)]
*  right? And you're like, no, told a joke. He's raised. What are you, what are we even saying here? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3940.3199999999997s)]
*  This is just arguing with leftists now. They're so obsessed with symbology. They're like, all right, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3946.16s)]
*  racism is a huge issue. We got to take down statues. We got to remove that. And you're my mom. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3951.2s)]
*  We got to take down the Indian on the butter. And we can't have any schools named Lee because [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3957.6s)]
*  that might be Robert E. Lee. It's like, all right, have any black kids learned to read as a cause of [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3964.16s)]
*  result of that? Have any gotten on the job training skills? No, no. Okay. Well, then you're obviously [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3968.48s)]
*  much more focused on symbology. And it's still symbology for him to focus only on Darrell Cooper. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3974.4s)]
*  It's like, okay, your criticism of the revisionist world war two narrative is to focus on one person. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3980.08s)]
*  Why don't you take a different person? How about president Herbert Hoover in 1953 wrote a book [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3987.28s)]
*  titled freedom betrayed, where he has 18 points very clear as to how through diplomacy this world [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3992.2400000000002s)]
*  war could have been avoided. His case is basically that it was almost inevitable for the national [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=3999.6800000000003s)]
*  socialists and the Bolsheviks to collide. That in no way means Britain or the U S has to make [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4005.44s)]
*  regional dispute into a world war. He says that even if we had to go to war with Japan, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4011.76s)]
*  he of course knows that the export control act of 1940 by Roosevelt was intentionally done to [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4018.8s)]
*  provoke the Japanese to attack America. So the Americans can take the side of the British. Again, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4025.52s)]
*  former president in 1953 was saying this kiss and can just respond to that. Hoover goes on to say, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4031.44s)]
*  if we didn't demand absolute unconditional surrender of the Japanese, they wouldn't have [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4037.6s)]
*  had to withdraw their colonies, two of which were in Korea and Vietnam. After pulling back their [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4042.56s)]
*  colonies, the U S had to go to war in Korea for three years. We then went to war in Vietnam, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4047.92s)]
*  fighting a proxy war against the Bolsheviks there. So there are very reasonable explanations for all [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4052.7999999999997s)]
*  these things from a large number of other people who are not Darrell Cooper and kiss and is still [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4058.08s)]
*  not addressing these very obvious claims. And we just know how pathetic it is when you say, well, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4063.76s)]
*  we can never allow independence to be violated. So that means all citizens of all the 50 states [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4069.36s)]
*  need to wage a war for independence against the Washington DC regime, which claims the right to [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4076.2400000000002s)]
*  rule them. This small group of people claims the right to impose taxes, claims the right to regulate [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4082.6400000000003s)]
*  their lives in all, in a large number of aspects. That's a violation of independence. Surely we're [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4088.48s)]
*  going to have to go to war over that. Or you could say the people of the Donbass region felt that [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4094.32s)]
*  their independence was being violated by the 2014 coup in Kiev led by Arseny Yatsenyuk in his [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4098.48s)]
*  anti-terrorism operation. So even the independence thing, they clearly see the costs of war are [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4105.36s)]
*  extraordinarily high and the outcomes are extraordinarily uncertain. Whenever you take [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4111.12s)]
*  it out of whatever individual frame they want to put things in, because they're always, they're [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4115.76s)]
*  primarily focusing on the potential motives of the person presenting the evidence as opposed to very [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4120.88s)]
*  plausible evidence. The woke right is Constantine Kissin, Douglas Murray, Ben Shapiro and Dennis [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4127.4400000000005s)]
*  Prager and Sean Hannity. Yeah, 100%. Couldn't agree more. Keith, it is, it is really just always a [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4132.88s)]
*  pleasure. Always a pleasure talking to you. Let our listeners and viewers know where they can [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4139.6s)]

*  It reads so quick because it's so subdivided in its sections. If you're interested in economics, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEtsTOkOoqM&t=4174.48s)]
