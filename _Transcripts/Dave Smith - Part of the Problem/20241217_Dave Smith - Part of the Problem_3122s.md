**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs)
*  What's up? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=0.0s)]
*  What's up everybody? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=17.0s)]
*  Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=18.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  He is Robbie the Fireburnstein and we are not live, but we are together and we are recording [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=21.48s)]
*  the episode. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=29.6s)]
*  The drones are shutting down our communications. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=30.6s)]
*  I mean it's not, let's not rule it out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=31.92s)]
*  Let's not rule it out. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=34.5s)]
*  It is a possibility. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=35.5s)]
*  But yes, we're having some tech issues with the site. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=37.04s)]
*  So no live stream today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=40.1s)]
*  These things happen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=41.88s)]
*  I do apologize. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=42.88s)]
*  But we will be recording an episode for you guys to all get. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=43.88s)]
*  So you know. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I can't believe I came all the way out to Jersey to be in the past. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=51.72s)]
*  It's a little disappointing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=52.72s)]
*  Well, the drones have changed everything. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=54.08s)]
*  You went from a non drone state to a drone state and you thought everything was going [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=56.24s)]
*  to be the same. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=60.28s)]
*  Do you like this, by the way? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=61.28s)]
*  This little it's never in frame of Trump, but my father in law got me this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=62.28s)]
*  It's a bobblehead Trump as Terminator. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=65.68s)]
*  I pray to that every night. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=69.56s)]
*  I thought it was cute. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=70.84s)]
*  It's fucking cut some government spending. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=71.84s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=73.88s)]
*  By the way, we should at least send him out like that to take down the drones. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=74.88s)]
*  He should personally get on the back of a bike with a shotgun. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=78.2s)]
*  Come on, tell me that wouldn't be some cool first footage. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=81.76s)]
*  First thing in office, personally going out and shooting drones like your ski shooting. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=85.66s)]
*  That's that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=89.22s)]
*  Listen, if that ends up happening, then we're off to a good start. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=91.22s)]
*  Yeah, the government space chariot. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=94.98s)]
*  I'm sure Elon Musk has some flying car that they don't actually haven't released yet. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=97.22s)]
*  And that could be the I mean, that's a win all around. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=101.46s)]
*  Donald Trump flying around in Elon Musk's flying car. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=103.98s)]
*  You roll out the flying cars and you shoot down the drones personally. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=107.14s)]
*  Listen, this is why we got to get you in the cabinet, Rob, because you're the you're the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=110.22s)]
*  guy who comes up with these ideas. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=114.22s)]
*  I wasn't going to think of it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  I did like on a more serious note, seeing on Twitter that it looks like our good friend, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=117.34s)]
*  good friend of the show who's been on several times, Thomas Massey, the best congressman [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=124.5s)]
*  in America by far, looks like he's going to be working with the Doge boys over there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=129.86s)]
*  Stacking the Doge card. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  So you know, we got Ron Paul as an advisor, Thomas Massey getting on board with it, Vavator [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=136.9s)]
*  and Elon Musk. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=145.05999999999997s)]
*  You know, they just need David Stockman. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=146.05999999999997s)]
*  Get Stockman on there for sure. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=150.7s)]
*  Although honestly, I mean, you know, Ron Paul knows all that stuff, too. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=152.38s)]
*  So that's fine. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=155.94s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=157.94s)]
*  I'm interested to see what Doge is actually able to accomplish. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=158.94s)]
*  And if anything, as we've said several times before, I mean, you have you got a team of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=162.5s)]
*  very capable, very intelligent people over there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=168.7s)]
*  But man, if nothing else, I just love the this stuff being inserted back into kind of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=173.06s)]
*  like the popular discussion. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  And it's it's really something that would have been impossible to predict. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=181.62s)]
*  Like a year ago, if I told you Trump was going to make up a fake department and then put [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  all these people there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=192.10000000000002s)]
*  But I saw just yesterday I saw on Twitter that Elon Musk just tweeted another Ron Paul [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  clip and was like Ron Paul spot on, you know, as always. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=202.46s)]
*  And you just take his like, I don't know how big his Twitter account is, but it's tens [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=206.22s)]
*  of millions of people. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=211.66s)]
*  And you're just like, geez, man, that is so it is pretty damn cool to have this, you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=213.3s)]
*  know, debatably second to Trump, most influential, most famous kind of person putting out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  like this hardcore, you know, libertarian message like our leader, you know, like his [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=227.14s)]
*  message out to the world. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=234.78s)]
*  Just incredible. It's an incredible time to be alive. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=236.06s)]
*  And that obviously there's there's lots of issues that we still have to deal with. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=239.06s)]
*  But that is, I got to say, pretty encouraging. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=244.14s)]
*  And also, I, you know, I don't mean to be self-serving with it at all, but I do think [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  it's that alone. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=254.14s)]
*  Let's say we had nothing else, just the Doge stuff. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=258.7s)]
*  No pardons or anything else. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=264.58s)]
*  The libertarians who supported Donald Trump are looking better and better. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=269.06s)]
*  It's just looking like, yeah, this way, because I mean, even just that it's. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=272.62s)]
*  That's more than you get with anyone else. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  That's it. Ron Paul's message is being amplified. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=280.97999999999996s)]
*  By one of the most influential human beings to ever live and the richest person to ever [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=284.38s)]
*  live. That's a pretty big deal. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=289.74s)]
*  And, you know, if that if that had been achieved by the Libertarian Party, I don't [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=291.74s)]
*  think any of the I think all of the people in the Libertarian Party would just be taking [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=298.46s)]
*  credit for it and talking about how awesome it is. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=302.62s)]
*  But the fact is, it was achieved by supporting someone from a different party. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=304.86s)]
*  And OK, you may not love that, but the goal should never be which vehicle achieved [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=308.38000000000005s)]
*  success. And again, I'm not saying this is I don't I'm not trying to spin it into [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=318.58000000000004s)]
*  something it's not. I'm not saying like we've cut government spending, but to get this [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=322.54s)]
*  message amplified like that is that's what we've all been in the business of trying to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=326.86s)]
*  do. So pretty incredible. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=330.66s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, we'll see. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=333.26000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. We'll see what Doge is actually able to do. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=334.94000000000005s)]
*  I'm kind of optimistic about it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=337.02000000000004s)]
*  If nothing else, they're going to be giving proposals that I think are going to be [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=339.26s)]
*  pretty awesome. You know, there's also weirdly I think there's kind of there is to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=342.1s)]
*  some degree an advantage to the fact that it's outside of government. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=348.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? And the advantage that is like won't take three years to get a [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=352.66s)]
*  single report that mostly brushes it onto the rug and goes, oh, well, we did a full [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=356.54s)]
*  review and it looks like we're actually doing OK with spending. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=360.66s)]
*  I mean, there's too much, but we recommend no changes. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=363.74s)]
*  Yeah, right. Exactly. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=366.06s)]
*  It's like once you're inside the apparatus of government, things just work in a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  certain way. And that's basically it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=372.38s)]
*  And then and then the recommendation becomes like, well, we're recommending spending [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=374.42s)]
*  freezes or we're recommending, you know, the old Paul Ryan thing that he used to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=379.74s)]
*  do. And the Democrats would flip out and be like, he's he's suggesting these major [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=385.26s)]
*  cuts. But what he would be suggesting was cuts to future increases in spending. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=389.42s)]
*  So like if they have a projection of spending over the next 20 years and it's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=395.78000000000003s)]
*  increasing by five trillion, he'd go like, let's only increase by four trillion. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=399.18s)]
*  And they'd be like, he's cutting a trillion dollars out of the budget. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=404.14000000000004s)]
*  You're like, no, he's not. No, he's not. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=406.98s)]
*  He's actually increasing by four trillion. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=408.62s)]
*  You know, and the numbers are I'm just making up these numbers for the sake of the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=411.14000000000004s)]
*  example. But anyway, but when they're outside of government, maybe it's it's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=414.3s)]
*  possible that we'll see something like, you know, proposals for actual spending [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=420.26s)]
*  cuts, not this like, OK, you can't touch military and you can't touch entitlements [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=425.46s)]
*  and you can't touch my other three pet projects, but you can cut two million [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=430.62s)]
*  dollars out of the, you know, whatever budget. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=435.82s)]
*  It's maybe they'll actually have some good recommendations and get Americans [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=438.06s)]
*  thinking about the fact that, yeah, you could actually have severe, drastic cuts [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=441.97999999999996s)]
*  in government spending that would make the American people's lives much better. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=449.5s)]
*  So we will see. We will see on that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=453.26s)]
*  All right. So there is a just wonderful story coming out of CNN. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=456.06s)]
*  And when I shouldn't say coming out of CNN, it's kind of about CNN. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=466.18s)]
*  But it's funny because, you know, you sent me this article today, Rob, as I was [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=472.86s)]
*  just just looking over it a few a few hours ago. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=477.18s)]
*  And so you sent me the zero hedge article, the title. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=482.42s)]
*  It was written by Tyler Durden. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=485.98s)]
*  That's who writes all the articles. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=488.66s)]
*  He is unbelievable. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=490.22s)]
*  This guy cranks out material left and right. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=491.98s)]
*  And handsome, handsome fellow as well. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=494.74s)]
*  Great abs. World class. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=497.58000000000004s)]
*  Incredible. And he's and he's willing to throw down, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=499.02000000000004s)]
*  which is one of the things I really respect about him. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=501.66s)]
*  OK, so the title of the article is it's the waste of the day, which is like a [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=504.1s)]
*  recurring piece that they have there, two hundred and sixty seven million dollars [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=509.46s)]
*  spent on fighting, quote, misinformation. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=516.5s)]
*  The federal government has recently spent [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=519.58s)]
*  two hundred sixty seven million dollars on grants meant to suppress supposed [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=521.66s)]
*  misinformation, according to this new report from OpenTheBooks.com. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=525.78s)]
*  So if you just think about the fact that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=530.18s)]
*  the government is spending hundreds of millions of your tax dollars to fight [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=533.66s)]
*  misinformation, which is, you know, as as I was reading this article this morning, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=540.42s)]
*  I was kind of thinking about maybe in a way that I haven't thought about it before. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=546.0999999999999s)]
*  But I was like, really, that's what we do. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=550.6999999999999s)]
*  We fight misinformation like that's kind of the whole thing of this show. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=555.74s)]
*  It's always like pointing out like this guy's giving you information that's bad. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=560.5s)]
*  This is bad information. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=564.26s)]
*  This is bad information. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=565.62s)]
*  So it's wild to see, you know, the government spending hundreds of millions [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=566.86s)]
*  of dollars on this topic and there's still quite a bit of misinformation out there. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=571.74s)]
*  Anyway, speaking of misinformation, I guess we needed two hundred and sixty [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=577.6600000000001s)]
*  eight million dollars because they missed this piece, which let's play the video. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=581.34s)]
*  This ran on CNN. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=587.6600000000001s)]
*  Not can't make this stuff up. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=590.22s)]
*  Let's jump into it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=592.26s)]
*  No problem. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=600.38s)]
*  I'm a civilian, he says. I'm a civilian. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=613.58s)]
*  He tells the fighter he's from the city of Homs and has been in the cell for three months. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=619.98s)]
*  OK, you're OK. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=630.3000000000001s)]
*  You're OK. You're OK. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=631.94s)]
*  You're OK. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=633.9s)]
*  Clutches my arm tightly with both hands. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=637.02s)]
*  Does anyone have any water? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=641.62s)]
*  Water. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=643.78s)]
*  This is my my my my my my. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=646.26s)]
*  OK, it's water. It's water. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=653.9399999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=655.78s)]
*  OK, you're OK. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=657.78s)]
*  They just get an Oscar for pretending like she cares. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=660.5s)]
*  I mean, the conversation they had off camera of, hey, can you find me a clean one? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=663.66s)]
*  Can someone can someone can someone clean one up and throw them in there? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=667.5s)]
*  Well, the thing about it is, is [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=671.66s)]
*  and look, this is this is true in general with corporate media, but they are, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=674.3s)]
*  even as you say it jokingly, like, can someone get her an Oscar? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=680.3s)]
*  The thing is, there are actors that is what this is acting. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=683.1s)]
*  This is a performance by everybody involved, but they're not good actors. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=686.02s)]
*  Like as somebody who I am not a good actor. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=690.02s)]
*  It's like a showtime porn acting. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=692.42s)]
*  Yes. Well, then I'm a cinemax. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=694.86s)]
*  It is a look. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=696.78s)]
*  You know, when I when I first started stand up comedy, it was still in the old world. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=698.62s)]
*  This is like I started stand up in 2006, which was pre revolution. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=704.0600000000001s)]
*  There's this whole industry has been revolutionized, but I was in before it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=711.3000000000001s)]
*  And back then, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=716.22s)]
*  MySpace was the social media thing and like some comedians had MySpace profiles, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=718.58s)]
*  but many didn't. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=723.94s)]
*  It wasn't like even viewed as a necessary thing to have. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=724.98s)]
*  But what they used to do is it was like the big thing for comedians was like, all [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=727.74s)]
*  right, well, you're doing stand up. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=733.18s)]
*  Can you write? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=736.18s)]
*  Can you act? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=737.2199999999999s)]
*  Because those were the things where it's like, well, if you can act, they'll send [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=738.3399999999999s)]
*  you out on auditions. And so like the first managers that I ever had sent me on [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=740.62s)]
*  several auditions, I've auditioned for parts before. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=745.18s)]
*  And however bad you think I am as an actor, I promise you it was worse. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=748.5799999999999s)]
*  Dude, I wish I wish I had the tapes from some of these auditions. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=753.54s)]
*  It was so brutal. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=758.18s)]
*  Dude, I I don't know. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=761.02s)]
*  I just whatever that skill is, I do not have it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=762.5s)]
*  And I'm so bad at it that you wouldn't even go like, oh, you really got to take [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=765.82s)]
*  some acting classes. You would go, you cannot do this. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=769.74s)]
*  Like it'd be like, you know, just somebody like if you were like, oh, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=773.14s)]
*  I've never played basketball before. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=775.62s)]
*  And they went out and they were just so bad that you were like, dude, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=777.06s)]
*  there's no point in even like trying to get you better. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=780.1s)]
*  This just isn't going to be your game. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=782.14s)]
*  Like, that's it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=783.82s)]
*  And but anyway, so I just I remember [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=785.78s)]
*  like very clearly being like, well, I'm terrible at this. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=791.02s)]
*  This is not for me. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=793.58s)]
*  I also just had no interest in it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=794.46s)]
*  I don't really like acting. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=796.14s)]
*  But when you see someone who's really great at it, it is it's an impressive [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=797.5s)]
*  skill and when you realize, like, it's such a weird thing because you're like, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=801.46s)]
*  how are you so much better at playing pretend than me? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=804.9s)]
*  That's all this is, is playing pretend. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=807.82s)]
*  And like somehow you're just really good at it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=809.94s)]
*  And I'm not. But anyway, you just notice that you once once you try to do it [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=811.94s)]
*  yourself and you're really bad at it, it kind of makes you appreciate, you know, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=816.46s)]
*  a little bit more like, oh, oh, he's good at it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=820.26s)]
*  You see like a good movie and you're like, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=822.58s)]
*  you know, that guy is fucking an incredible actor. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=823.9399999999999s)]
*  But you're watching this in this video right now. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=826.06s)]
*  You're watching bad actors. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=827.98s)]
*  I know what acting is. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=829.58s)]
*  Not now, by the way, and we'll play more of this. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=831.02s)]
*  But [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=833.54s)]
*  there were so many giveaways that right away, as soon as all of us saw this video, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=835.14s)]
*  we all know I was texting with Rogan a whole bunch about it before. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=840.66s)]
*  It was all admitted that it was bullshit. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=844.06s)]
*  And he said he said to me, because you see this shit. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=845.8199999999999s)]
*  And I go, yeah, I saw it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=847.98s)]
*  And he goes, dude. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=849.06s)]
*  And I was like, I know. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=850.26s)]
*  And it's because just very basic things where he goes, OK, so the claim is this [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=851.42s)]
*  guy was held in one of Assad's notoriously brutal prisons for four months. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=856.14s)]
*  First of all, just the way he stood up. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=862.6199999999999s)]
*  You were like, nope, nope. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=864.8199999999999s)]
*  You have not been like the second of all, there's the room is clean. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=867.06s)]
*  There's not feces. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=872.8199999999999s)]
*  There's not, you know what I mean? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=874.5799999999999s)]
*  It's like a cleaner. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=875.78s)]
*  And then to me, the most obvious one, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=876.54s)]
*  they said that the claim was that he hadn't had food or water in four days. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=878.74s)]
*  Pull up the video, just look at his face. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=885.62s)]
*  Just let's just take a look at his face, maybe even start to walk. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=889.9s)]
*  Here, you could just play for a little bit until it comes right there. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=894.42s)]
*  Nope, nope. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=897.5s)]
*  Sorry, that's not the face of someone who hasn't had food or water in four days. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=899.1s)]
*  I don't know, like if you've ever seen [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=903.1s)]
*  somebody here, here's a good pull up, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=907.1s)]
*  Natalie, if you could just Google real quick, Connor McGregor, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=911.18s)]
*  one forty five weight cut. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=915.74s)]
*  OK, to see a picture, if you know what [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=919.26s)]
*  Connor McGregor normally looks like, look at a picture of Connor McGregor, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=921.74s)]
*  maybe even if they have like a side to side one with his like. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=925.98s)]
*  Yeah, because then you can kind of see [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=931.1400000000001s)]
*  what he looks like and what someone looks like when they're cutting weight. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=933.1s)]
*  The reason I bring this up is because. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=937.4200000000001s)]
*  Essentially, so yeah, look, look at that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=943.5400000000001s)]
*  OK, now, by the way, that's not look at that picture of Connor McGregor right there. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=946.5s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=950.4200000000001s)]
*  Now, when you cut the reason I bring up [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=951.46s)]
*  cutting weight, this is for people who don't know if you're not [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=953.6600000000001s)]
*  into MMA. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=957.3399999999999s)]
*  So essentially what they do is they have weight limits. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=959.2199999999999s)]
*  Right. So you have weight classes. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=962.42s)]
*  But so Connor McGregor there is fighting at one hundred and forty five pounds. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=964.6999999999999s)]
*  But Connor McGregor weighs like one hundred seventy pounds. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=968.7399999999999s)]
*  So what and this is what they all do is they cut weight, they weigh in, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=972.6999999999999s)]
*  then they rehydrate. Now, cutting weight is essentially dehydrating yourself. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=977.38s)]
*  That's what you're doing. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=982.8599999999999s)]
*  So when they say this guy hasn't had water in four days, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  this is what people look like if they haven't had water in four days. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=986.62s)]
*  You are sucked out. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=989.7s)]
*  You're going to you're going to look like like almost like, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=991.26s)]
*  I don't know what the word is skeleton skeleton skeleton like, you know, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=994.98s)]
*  this guy back to the CNN video just clearly is not he has not gone four days [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=999.02s)]
*  with that water. It's very obvious you can look at his cheeks. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1003.5s)]
*  Sorry. Nope. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1006.34s)]
*  That's not what a person looks like in that situation. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1007.54s)]
*  Anyway, he looks like every foreigner trying to find their way in Times Square. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1009.9399999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1013.58s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1015.06s)]
*  And thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Monetary Metals. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1016.26s)]
*  I've been telling you guys about this company for a while now. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1019.82s)]
*  It's a great company run by great people, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1022.62s)]
*  and they are truly revolutionizing the precious metal space. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1025.22s)]
*  For a long time, people have owned silver and gold as an investment, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1028.38s)]
*  as a hedge against inflation. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1032.8600000000001s)]
*  But for the first time ever, because of monetary metals, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1034.5s)]
*  you can now have your precious metals working for you to generate more ounces [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1037.38s)]
*  over time. So you not only own gold or silver, but you own gold or silver. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1041.86s)]
*  That's working for you to generate more gold and silver. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1046.46s)]
*  If you're interested, you've got to go check them out. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1049.6599999999999s)]
*  You can click the link in the episode description, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1051.9399999999998s)]
*  or you can go to monetary dash metals dot com to learn more. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1054.22s)]
*  They also still have the silver bond offerings going on. Check it out. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1058.3s)]
*  As I said, they have revolutionized this space. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1062.3799999999999s)]
*  It's really incredible what they're doing. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1064.58s)]
*  Monetary dash metals dot com. All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1066.22s)]
*  Anyway, so this is all an act and they know they also they claim that the guy [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1070.9s)]
*  shot the prison door open, but the camera turns away when he shoots. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1074.74s)]
*  Anyway, let's let's keep playing the video [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1080.26s)]
*  to get a little bit of say, which is how how fake the whole thing is, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1082.5s)]
*  how much this is all just theater, just acting. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1086.26s)]
*  OK, we start to walk him outside. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1101.74s)]
*  Thank God you are safe. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1106.74s)]
*  The film crew still rolling, so I continue to touch the man. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1108.18s)]
*  This is the third prison they brought me to, he says. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1114.34s)]
*  The third prison after three months. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1117.14s)]
*  I got this nice jacket at this one. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1120.14s)]
*  Finally see the sky. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1122.98s)]
*  Oh, all right. So let's pause it right there. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1124.74s)]
*  After months in a cell, he can finally see the sky. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1127.06s)]
*  And yet the sun seems to have no impact on him. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1130.78s)]
*  Did that set off any alarms for anybody? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1134.94s)]
*  You are aware. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1138.34s)]
*  I don't know if any of you guys have ever [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1139.34s)]
*  spent some time in a dark room and then walked out into the sunlight. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1140.7s)]
*  But you're not you're going to squint at least a little bit. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1143.98s)]
*  So again, this is the point I'm making on picking up on all of these things. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1148.46s)]
*  And there's, of course, like, you know, these days with the Internet, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1153.06s)]
*  there's people far smarter than me who pay attention to detail, who picked apart, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1155.82s)]
*  you know, the 17 more things that were obvious giveaways. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1159.94s)]
*  But the point is. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1163.7s)]
*  That. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1166.02s)]
*  Even if hypothetically, this CNN lady got fooled or something like that, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1168.14s)]
*  there's no way the amount of people, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1175.8200000000002s)]
*  the amount of eyes that would have to be on this before it airs on CNN's network. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1178.5s)]
*  And nobody picked up on these obvious tells, these obvious. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1184.94s)]
*  It reminds me of, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1189.9s)]
*  oh, my God, maybe you could find this actually, Natalie. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1192.02s)]
*  But if you. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1194.5400000000002s)]
*  If you Google MSNBC, Bloomberg [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1197.26s)]
*  gives all his money away. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1203.8200000000002s)]
*  I want to say it was on the Lawrence O'Donnell show. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1207.22s)]
*  There was it may be, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1214.14s)]
*  you know what, those might not be the best keywords to find it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1216.9s)]
*  But do you remember what I'm talking about? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1219.22s)]
*  So this was like I believe it was Bloomberg. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1221.3s)]
*  So it was right around the time that Bloomberg is [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1223.5s)]
*  was running for president and they run. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1227.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1230.22s)]
*  Yeah, here we go. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1231.78s)]
*  Let's wait for this clip to come up because this was really an entertaining one. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1233.02s)]
*  This is from I guess it would be 2020. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1238.3s)]
*  Right. Wasn't that when Bloomberg ran? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1242.34s)]
*  OK, so here it is. Yes, let's play it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1245.3s)]
*  This is just OK. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1247.1s)]
*  There's something really remarkable about this. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1248.46s)]
*  So here, let's let's play this clip. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1251.26s)]
*  It is a possibility if he wants to spend a billion bucks. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1253.26s)]
*  It was Brian Williams. This guy, he could do it. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1256.22s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1258.86s)]
*  Somebody tweeted recently that actually with the money he spent, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1260.4199999999998s)]
*  he could have given every American a million dollars. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1263.74s)]
*  Let's put it up on the screen. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1266.6599999999999s)]
*  When I read it tonight on social media, it kind of all became clear. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1268.26s)]
*  Bloomberg spent five hundred million on ads. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1273.62s)]
*  U.S. population, 327 million. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1275.66s)]
*  Don't tell us if you're ahead of us on the math. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1278.66s)]
*  He could have given each American one million dollars and have had lunch money [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1280.74s)]
*  left over. It's an incredible way of putting it. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1285.98s)]
*  It is an incredible way of putting it. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1288.66s)]
*  It is quite literally an incredible way of putting it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1290.7s)]
*  That I could not have said it better myself. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1298.86s)]
*  I mean, it's just but you just go like the number of people. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1301.1s)]
*  Listen, just as somebody who's done cable news, a decent amount. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1304.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1309.1s)]
*  The fact that they don't do it like we do it, they don't have me go, hey, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1310.34s)]
*  Natalie, would you Google this for me? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1315.6200000000001s)]
*  That's not the way things work in cable news. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1317.34s)]
*  They don't do the Jamie, pull that up stuff. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1319.5s)]
*  They have this laid out already. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1322.06s)]
*  At least seven or eight people had to look at this and no one went, wait, what? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1324.54s)]
*  Hold on. I'm sorry. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1330.6200000000001s)]
*  Let me get the math on this. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1332.6200000000001s)]
*  Right. You're telling me he could have no, no, no. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1333.7s)]
*  He could give everybody one dollar and have money left over for lunch, not one [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1337.3400000000001s)]
*  million dollars. How do you get this so wrong? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1341.6200000000001s)]
*  Like the thing about that one is that it's not just like, oh, I forgot to [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1345.46s)]
*  carry the one or whatever. You know what I mean? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1353.5s)]
*  It's such as a math mistake. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1355.38s)]
*  It's that your entire worldview would have to be like right away. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1356.6200000000001s)]
*  If I just said that to you and go, wait, hold on, hold on. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1361.5s)]
*  That can't be right. That can't quite be right. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1363.42s)]
*  It can't be that he could give every single American a million dollars. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1366.46s)]
*  And so that's not exactly that can't be the numbers of this. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1369.66s)]
*  And again, it just it shows you like this example is a little different. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1372.6200000000001s)]
*  I think this is just you see the incompetence of it. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1378.8200000000002s)]
*  But in this one, I'm saying like even if they weren't just lying through their [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1381.54s)]
*  teeth, which they are, obviously. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1386.54s)]
*  But [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1388.9s)]
*  how do you not have some? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1391.22s)]
*  How does somebody not look at this and go, guys, guys, guys, we we can't just [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1393.8600000000001s)]
*  rush to air with this. This is too crazy. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1398.22s)]
*  I mean, this is, you know, at the very least, there'd be like some eyebrows raised. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1401.74s)]
*  You wouldn't do what she's doing, which is just reporting it as if it is fact, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1407.38s)]
*  as if it is like, first of all, you go like, OK, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1412.78s)]
*  Al Qaeda just took over the country, right? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1416.98s)]
*  Who exactly am I getting the source from that? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1420.82s)]
*  We're just going to trust right away. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1423.62s)]
*  You'd have a little bit of skepticism. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1425.5s)]
*  But then, I mean, just again, just look at this. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1427.78s)]
*  Who would look at this and not know it's fucking fake? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1429.82s)]
*  I mean, like, who would just look at this and not be like, oh, these are people. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1432.62s)]
*  Act they are lying. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1435.78s)]
*  These are these are a group of people all lying. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1437.06s)]
*  But again, I guess maybe the bigger point here is like. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1439.58s)]
*  And why? Why are they lying? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1444.02s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's fairly easy to to see. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1446.86s)]
*  When if I, you know, if if the corporate media is lying about how terrible Donald [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1453.74s)]
*  Trump is, it's like, well, why are they lying? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1459.3799999999999s)]
*  And looks, they want Joe Biden to win or they want Kamala Harris to win. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1460.98s)]
*  Like you kind of say when they're lying about the vaccine [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1463.58s)]
*  working in a way that it doesn't, you know, you can't get covid, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1467.22s)]
*  you can't transmit covid if you get the vaccine. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1470.62s)]
*  Well, why are they doing that? Because they want you to get the vaccine. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1472.3s)]
*  Right. Like you figure. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1474.02s)]
*  But so then that's it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1475.3s)]
*  What are they doing here? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1476.58s)]
*  Like, what is the goal of the media? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1478.46s)]
*  And it's very clearly is that they want to. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1480.3s)]
*  Essentially rehabilitate Al Qaeda, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1486.8600000000001s)]
*  they want to convince you that what just happened in Syria is a good thing. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1490.3s)]
*  Now, listen, Bashar al-Assad had these brutal prisons. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1493.82s)]
*  Look at this poor guy who was there. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1496.5s)]
*  He's free now because Assad is gone. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1498.26s)]
*  He's free. See, things are better in Syria now than they were before. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1500.6200000000001s)]
*  And I mean, why on earth? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1504.54s)]
*  Anyone would want to be in the business of rehabilitating Al Qaeda's image, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1509.6599999999999s)]
*  and people can give me whatever shit they want to about, you know, it's [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1515.1799999999998s)]
*  so funny to see these people. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1518.62s)]
*  I remember [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1521.06s)]
*  Kathy Young, who is, you know who she is? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1524.06s)]
*  She's just the worst. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1528.6599999999999s)]
*  She's a she kind of floated in like [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1530.74s)]
*  libertarian circles for a little bit, I think she might have written for reason [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1533.22s)]
*  for a little bit, but she's she debated Scott Horton on Ukraine at Porkfest. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1537.06s)]
*  And if you've never watched it before, it is. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1544.58s)]
*  I mean, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1547.26s)]
*  I've been a part of some pretty one sided debates. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1548.98s)]
*  It was the most one sided debate I think I've ever seen. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1552.22s)]
*  I mean, it was just it was worse than Bill Crystal. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1555.1s)]
*  Maybe not worth it. They were both pretty bad. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1559.06s)]
*  But they did, you know, Jean Epstein does the Oxford style debates. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1561.2199999999998s)]
*  By the way, the Soho Forum, unbelievable debate series. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1564.5s)]
*  If you're in the New York area, make sure to go check one out. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1567.8999999999999s)]
*  It's it's run and moderated by the great Jean Epstein. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1570.34s)]
*  But she literally, you know, he does the Oxford style debate. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1574.6999999999998s)]
*  So you vote at the beginning where you stand on the resolution and then you vote [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1578.2199999999998s)]
*  at the end and they measure who moved more people. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1582.34s)]
*  And she got one vote at the end and it was the guy she came with. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1585.46s)]
*  There was one person in the crowd who was like her, I don't know, her husband, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1591.7s)]
*  her boyfriend or friend lying to try and bang her. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1596.54s)]
*  Yes, like that was the vote that she got was the one. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1599.02s)]
*  It was just so overwhelming. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1601.98s)]
*  But there's one point. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1603.4199999999998s)]
*  It's so funny to watch them. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1606.06s)]
*  But so there's one point where she goes, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1607.6599999999999s)]
*  she goes to Scott as she's like, well, you know, she goes, we could get it. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1611.98s)]
*  She goes, it's probably not important to get into the Azov battalion. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1617.82s)]
*  Like that could be a whole separate debate for itself. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1621.82s)]
*  I don't really want to spend time on that now. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1624.06s)]
*  And Scott goes, of course, you don't want to spend time on that now. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1625.98s)]
*  Of course, you don't want to talk about that. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1629.1399999999999s)]
*  And then she says something else. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1630.66s)]
*  And he goes, he goes, on a scale of one to 10, how much do they love Adolf Hitler? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1632.34s)]
*  And she goes, well, and he goes, it's 10. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1636.98s)]
*  The answer is 10. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1639.34s)]
*  They like these are for people who don't know. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1640.78s)]
*  It's all covered in Scott's wonderful new book. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1643.98s)]
*  But yeah, Ukraine has a real Nazi problem. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1648.1s)]
*  And I don't know, honestly, I'm not sure exactly where that Nazi problem is today, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1651.6999999999998s)]
*  because I do know that it's true that a lot of them were on the front lines in this [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1657.1s)]
*  fight, you know, the Nazis. We're not talking Nazis here the way [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1661.8999999999999s)]
*  people call people in America Nazi. You know what I mean? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1665.34s)]
*  It's not like the way people call Donald Trump Nazis. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1668.46s)]
*  I'm talking about like swastika tattooed on your fucking shoulder. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1670.6200000000001s)]
*  The Ukraine war actually got rid of Nazis. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1675.18s)]
*  This whole time I've been talking about all these innocent soldiers that had to die. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1677.26s)]
*  And really, we just cleaned Ukraine of some Nazis. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1680.22s)]
*  Well, there were a lot of innocent soldiers, too, but or innocent conscripts, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1682.06s)]
*  whatever, however you want to think of them. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1685.78s)]
*  But yeah, there were some Nazis that got killed in it for sure, too. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1687.26s)]
*  But Ukraine has had a long [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1690.42s)]
*  Nazi problem as people, history nerds may know. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1693.7s)]
*  Ukraine was once occupied by the Nazis and a lot of them joined up with the [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1697.78s)]
*  Nazis and, you know, to some degree, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1703.82s)]
*  you know, it's kind of somewhat understandable. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1707.54s)]
*  Like if you were living under Stalin and someone came in to liberate you, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1709.54s)]
*  you might be on their side. So there was some of that. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1713.54s)]
*  And then a lot of them were kind of like, oh, these Nazis aren't doing too much [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1715.86s)]
*  liberating around here and turned against them later. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1719.1399999999999s)]
*  But there were a whole bunch of people who really wanted the Nazis to invade [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1721.74s)]
*  beforehand and then enthusiastically joined up and then were Nazis all the way [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1725.1s)]
*  through and their kids were Nazis and the grandkids were Nazis. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1729.7s)]
*  Like that's and that's who the third generation Nazis. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1732.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1735.6599999999999s)]
*  So anyway, so and then Kathy Young in the debate when he says that he goes, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1736.98s)]
*  she goes, yes, you know, the Azov battalion started as a Nazi organization. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1742.7s)]
*  It's evolved since then, which is just like, you know, what are you talking about? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1748.3s)]
*  Like you would never you would never if there was a right wing American group [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1753.7399999999998s)]
*  that was founded by a racist, you would never say to that, you know, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1759.2199999999998s)]
*  like it'd be like on the level, dude, if I was just kind of like defending the [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1765.1399999999999s)]
*  Ku Klux Klan and you were like the Klan, didn't they like burn crosses on black [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1768.9399999999998s)]
*  people's yards? I was like, yeah, but when was the last time they've done that? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1773.26s)]
*  It's a totally different organization today. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1775.9399999999998s)]
*  Now, by the way, that is true, right? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1777.8999999999999s)]
*  There is not violence from the Ku Klux Klan today at all. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1779.82s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1783.14s)]
*  Correct me, Internet, if I'm wrong about that. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1784.42s)]
*  But when was the last time you heard about a Klansman being violent? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1786.14s)]
*  I don't think it exists. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1789.26s)]
*  Yet if someone joins that group, you still go, I don't know, dude, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1791.98s)]
*  you're a Klansman. Like, what are you talking about? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1797.38s)]
*  Yet. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1800.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, for Nazis in Ukraine, somehow we'll make this this distinction. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1801.98s)]
*  But it's the same thing here going on with Syria. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1806.8600000000001s)]
*  Like they can say, oh, Jelani, he's not in Al Qaeda anymore. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1810.66s)]
*  You're like he was the emir of Syria, Al Qaeda's head guy in Syria for years. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1815.54s)]
*  This is a true real deal bin Laden, a jihadist. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1822.6200000000001s)]
*  They tell me the work of this PR [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1826.66s)]
*  campaign that they're doing to like rehabilitate his image, like he's some type [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1829.74s)]
*  of moderate freedom fighting rebel, this is just absurd. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1834.06s)]
*  Then it's like insane to watch people do it, to watch people go like the only [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1837.74s)]
*  again, to be clear here, the only real enemy that we have in this whole fight, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1843.5s)]
*  Al Qaeda, the only ones who actually attacked America. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1849.78s)]
*  I guess you could say ISIS did some attacks too. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1853.1799999999998s)]
*  But that's and CNN is on a campaign to rehabilitate them and just lying through [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1855.8999999999999s)]
*  their mouth. Anyway, Rob, you want to read another [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1862.46s)]
*  piece about why trust in the corporate media is evaporating? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1864.7s)]
*  I could it must be because Rumble's filled with liars, right? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1868.3400000000001s)]
*  That must be the answer. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1872.22s)]
*  And this story is even richer. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1874.38s)]
*  It has a punch line. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1876.3400000000001s)]
*  You would have thought it couldn't get any worse than them just fabricating a story. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1877.78s)]
*  Who the guy turns out to be. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1881.94s)]
*  It's now being reported that he was a actual torturer in these prisons. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1883.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I guess a high ranking torturer. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1886.82s)]
*  It's an esteemed position. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1889.14s)]
*  And when you're working for a dictator, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1890.1000000000001s)]
*  if you would just turn the heat down a little bit. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1891.8999999999999s)]
*  I there is something. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1894.86s)]
*  And listen, I want to preface what I'm about to say by saying torture is bad. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1896.74s)]
*  Don't torture people. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1902.62s)]
*  If you're any of our listeners out there, if you were on the fence, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1903.8999999999999s)]
*  if you were like, I might torture someone today, let me nudge you in the right [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1906.9799999999998s)]
*  direction here, don't do it. It's not worth it. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1911.62s)]
*  We've all been there, but it never works out well. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1914.5s)]
*  That disclaimer being said, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1919.34s)]
*  kind of impressed with that guy. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1922.02s)]
*  You mean just the sociopathness? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1924.46s)]
*  It's a balls out move to be one of Bashar Al-Assad's torturers in one of his [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1928.02s)]
*  notoriously brutal prisons and to just be torturing people in that prison. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1934.7s)]
*  And then the regime falls and Assad flees. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1939.58s)]
*  And then you just get under a blanket and you go, oh, liberators, thank you so much [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1942.66s)]
*  for coming and saving me. Like, that is something that you're like, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1947.58s)]
*  that's incredible. That's right out of a Bank Heist movie. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1951.1399999999999s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1953.1399999999999s)]
*  They're trying to blend in with the hostages to get out. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1954.3s)]
*  Yeah. There's like that guy in one room. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1956.94s)]
*  There's an Asian in a tiny box in another room. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1959.1399999999999s)]
*  There's fun. Yeah, it's truly incredible. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1961.7s)]
*  But again, I mean, what? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1964.5s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1967.3799999999999s)]
*  It's such a the whole thing is so cartoonish, but that you literally go, OK, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1968.6599999999999s)]
*  so this is what's coming out of the cable news network. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1973.7s)]
*  This is what's airing on CNN. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1979.26s)]
*  While the while our government has been [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1981.98s)]
*  spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fight disinformation over the last few [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1984.02s)]
*  years, and then you know, just all of them sitting there. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1988.5800000000002s)]
*  Why are people trusting Joe Rogan? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1992.02s)]
*  You know, why do people trust comedians on the Internet over the mainstream media? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=1994.46s)]
*  Because none of us do that. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2001.06s)]
*  You know, whatever that is, none of us are in the business of lying to you. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2002.94s)]
*  I'm mostly of the opinion that CNN is just another division of government, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2008.38s)]
*  and that's why Brennan works there. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2011.94s)]
*  It's just a different role within the CIA. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2013.26s)]
*  And it seems like if there's one thing [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2015.46s)]
*  that the Biden administration does not do well was coordinate with the news networks. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2017.22s)]
*  So, for example, pardoning his kid and [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2021.38s)]
*  bitching them all out on getting his back or stepping out of the election right [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2023.38s)]
*  after they go, hey, you're actually just watching cheap fakes. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2027.74s)]
*  This almost feels like someone at CNN had [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2030.94s)]
*  to call them up and be like, why didn't you give us warning? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2032.86s)]
*  We could have gotten great footage of these prisons and like, all right, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2035.26s)]
*  I guess we can fake it. Yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2039.06s)]
*  All right. I guess like, you know what I mean? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2040.62s)]
*  The like the actual filmmakers were like, I guess we can. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2042.26s)]
*  We'll try and find a guy. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2045.94s)]
*  We'll figure it out. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2047.3s)]
*  And then the best I could get was and they [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2048.46s)]
*  couldn't even think to put the guy in prison clothes or go to Gaza. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2050.22s)]
*  Just recruit someone for a sandwich. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2054.18s)]
*  You can find someone who's hungry. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2056.14s)]
*  Yeah, you could find someone who actually [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2057.58s)]
*  looks like they haven't had food or water in four days. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2059.02s)]
*  And if you're going to do propaganda on this level, where Stephen Spielberg, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2061.42s)]
*  you know, get some good get some good lighting that makes things look more [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2064.46s)]
*  torturous. Well, they just look like my apartment. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2067.74s)]
*  I do remember CNN got busted [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2070.9s)]
*  for I think it was. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2075.94s)]
*  I do see if you could find this, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2079.58s)]
*  if you if you Google CNN fake Persian Gulf footage, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2081.06s)]
*  I believe they got busted for this, but it was like they got away with it [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2088.02s)]
*  at the time and then they, you know, like years later, I think they're someone got. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2092.9s)]
*  I forget exactly how it went down. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2098.62s)]
*  My advice to the networks is hire ugly. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2100.54s)]
*  Yeah, here. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2102.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2104.3s)]
*  My advice to the networks is to hire uglier people. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2106.22s)]
*  Well, here you go. Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2109.62s)]
*  Have been a ground impact of a scud. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2111.14s)]
*  It could have been a ground impact of a patriot or it could have been the result [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2113.06s)]
*  of debris falling between the two of them. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2117.02s)]
*  We just don't know right now, but we do know that at least two scud missiles [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2118.94s)]
*  incoming were fired at Riyadh and according to the Saudi military, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2122.34s)]
*  they were both shot down. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2125.46s)]
*  Charles J. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2126.82s)]
*  Kocian and reporting live from Saudi Arabia. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2127.62s)]
*  What? That was just in studio. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2131.46s)]
*  There's no palm trees in Saudi Arabia. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2133.2599999999998s)]
*  What's the punch line? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2134.94s)]
*  Was almost exactly two hours ago when the sirens went off here. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2136.34s)]
*  Yeah, I guess he's we are in eastern Saudi Arabia. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2139.22s)]
*  There was no problem. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2141.98s)]
*  However, there was an intercept elsewhere. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2143.06s)]
*  Hold on here. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2145.54s)]
*  Yeah. Skip ahead a little bit. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2146.5s)]
*  You know, I don't I don't exactly remember the details of this. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2147.7799999999997s)]
*  All right. We are now let to understand [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2151.22s)]
*  that there are also firings in another city in Saudi Arabia. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2152.98s)]
*  CNN's Karl Rochelle is here with me. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2156.22s)]
*  Just came up. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2158.7s)]
*  Karl, I know we can't be very specific given these restrictions, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2159.74s)]
*  but within those parameters, what did you say? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2162.5s)]
*  Well, what I said, I didn't see anything. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2164.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Anyway, OK, we could turn this up. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2166.8599999999997s)]
*  But yeah, it was a whole fake thing. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2168.42s)]
*  My point is just they've been in the business of doing this shit for a very [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2170.46s)]
*  long time. It's just like, oh, like the constant theme of all of this, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2173.38s)]
*  of the whole last year, it's like their inability to adjust to the new reality [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2178.54s)]
*  where it's like you just can't do this shit anymore. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2185.34s)]
*  There's a whole Internet world out there now. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2188.7400000000002s)]
*  And yet, by the way, I mean, when you said it turned out to be [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2191.1s)]
*  one of the torturers, just to be clear, CNN admitted this. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2194.7s)]
*  CNN themselves went, yeah, we got it wrong. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2198.74s)]
*  So it's just like the pressure they got from everyone online. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2202.14s)]
*  And then everyone online has all these people online have so much bigger [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2206.14s)]
*  audiences than CNN has. So it's just not it's like, you know, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2210.02s)]
*  I've said a few times before, it's like this game only works when you're giant [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2213.3s)]
*  and we're small. That's what the game relies on. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2218.34s)]
*  But when we're bigger than you, you can't you can't lie like this. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2222.06s)]

*  OK, let's let's switch gears and go to one of these [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2395.18s)]
*  topics that I had. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2399.5s)]
*  I did want to play this this from a couple of days ago. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2400.62s)]
*  Found kind of interesting, more on a kind of similar theme of [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2404.82s)]
*  people in the corporate media world. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2410.18s)]
*  This was Katie Couric and Jessica Tarlov [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2412.66s)]
*  talking about, you know, kind of more on the theme of post mortem of what happened [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2416.18s)]
*  here. I will say, by the way, you know, I've never [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2421.94s)]
*  I've never met or been a fan of Katie Couric. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2425.42s)]
*  I did like that documentary Fed Up that she made. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2428.98s)]
*  I thought that was actually very good. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2431.82s)]
*  I don't know if you're familiar with it as a document. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2433.5s)]
*  You know, I actually don't know if she made it or what her involvement was, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2435.78s)]
*  but she like narrated the documentary. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2439.38s)]
*  It's about it was about [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2442.06s)]
*  the obesity epidemic in America. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2444.98s)]
*  And she was actually she they got into a lot [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2448.02s)]
*  of how corrupt the kind of whole government system is and [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2451.06s)]
*  you know, like the food pyramid and all that propaganda that they put out, which [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2457.14s)]
*  is really fucking as somebody who grew up on that, like that was a thing. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2460.5s)]
*  I remember it being pulled up in my classroom. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2464.42s)]
*  And make sure you eat your bread. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2466.9s)]
*  Yes. This is literally what the government told told people in in the 90s. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2468.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think it was may have come out in the 80s. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2473.98s)]
*  They were like, you're going to want to limit your meat and vegetables. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2477.02s)]
*  I'm not saying you can't have any of them, but like, don't go overboard with these [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2479.7s)]
*  meat and vegetables, you're going to want a lot of carbs, white bread, you know, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2483.14s)]
*  Cheerios, this is what you really like. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2488.2599999999998s)]
*  You're running a marathon tomorrow and you got a car below. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2490.5s)]
*  Yeah, they they literally were telling people to be addicted to sugar. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2493.1s)]
*  Like eight servings. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2498.7s)]
*  Yes, an insane amount, an insane amount. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2499.82s)]
*  And it's just, you know, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2503.86s)]
*  these are the people who are in charge of fighting misinformation, by the way, you [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2505.7s)]
*  know, but it's the documentary was it was really powerful. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2508.54s)]
*  It also it it showed like it followed a few of these like obese kids. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2512.38s)]
*  And it was just so good size. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2518.2599999999998s)]
*  Dude, it was so sad, though, like there's these kids who are like [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2520.5s)]
*  just morbidly obese and they're like seven. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2524.5s)]
*  And it does that. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2527.74s)]
*  One of the things that's powerful about that is that you go like, look, you could [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2529.34s)]
*  kind of say whatever you want to when it comes to adults. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2533.54s)]
*  It's very easy, particularly with fat people, because. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2536.2599999999998s)]
*  You know. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2540.8599999999997s)]
*  People have their own kind of impulses about how they view [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2543.3799999999997s)]
*  somebody who's like morbidly obese, and it's very easy to say like, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2548.22s)]
*  I'll get your life together, man, come on, this is a decision. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2552.14s)]
*  And to some degree, that's true. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2554.66s)]
*  But when you're talking about little kids, it is very much different. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2555.8599999999997s)]
*  You're like, no, no, no, that kid is just a victim. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2558.2599999999998s)]
*  It was not their job to fucking make sure that they didn't become morbidly obese by [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2560.3799999999997s)]
*  age seven. That's not right. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2565.06s)]
*  You know, and what you do, one of the things you see in the documentary [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2566.9s)]
*  going off on a tangent here, but it is like the level of ignorance that some [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2571.38s)]
*  of these parents would have where they really didn't seem like bad people. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2576.34s)]
*  They just have no. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2580.3s)]
*  So they just do, you know, there's like this fat mom with her like [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2581.54s)]
*  morbidly obese son, and she's like, we're trying to do everything we can. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2586.34s)]
*  Like, he likes hot pockets. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2589.7s)]
*  So I get him the lean pockets. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2591.34s)]
*  You know, and it's like, that's this mother's conception of like what healthy [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2592.9s)]
*  eating is, is like instead of getting hot pockets, I got the lean pockets. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2597.9s)]
*  So your kid is just eating this microwave. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2602.26s)]
*  There's one scene where there's this obese girl and she's just they're all [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2604.98s)]
*  they're sitting there being interviewed for a documentary about her kids health [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2608.54s)]
*  and they're going over and she starts her morning with a bowl of pops. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2613.02s)]
*  You remember the cereal corn pops? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2618.86s)]
*  Unless you say, God, I have my pops. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2620.78s)]
*  That is what they say. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2623.02s)]
*  But anyway, and she goes to anyway, the documentary was kind of good. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2624.62s)]
*  And they go through the Michelle Obama thing, which was really interesting [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2627.14s)]
*  that essentially when Michelle Obama comes in to the White House, her first thing [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2632.58s)]
*  that is going to be her big initiative that she's going to is like healthy kids, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2637.18s)]
*  which is such a great first lady thing to do because who could be offended by that? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2640.7799999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2645.8199999999997s)]
*  It's just like, yeah, everyone can agree. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2646.42s)]
*  Like, let's get these kids healthy. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2647.74s)]
*  And she had I forget what they called it, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2649.06s)]
*  but she had this whole campaign to like get kids eating good and get them. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2650.66s)]
*  And you just see the way it works. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2654.3s)]
*  So I can be a man looking like a lady. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2655.86s)]
*  You can be if you can turn your kids skinny. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2657.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2660.14s)]
*  She goes, biology isn't real, evidently. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2660.86s)]
*  So but but you see the way it comes. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2663.34s)]
*  It's like immediately all the big corporate money starts flowing in Coca [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2666.1s)]
*  Cola and McDonald's and all of them are like, we love your initiative. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2670.3s)]
*  We're going to donate 10 million dollars to it. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2673.5s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2675.62s)]
*  And in fact, we're even going to give you some of our experts to help craft the [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2676.46s)]
*  and then it ends up being the the the calorie in calorie out thing, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2680.42s)]
*  which was all just a big scheme by these big companies. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2686.06s)]
*  And it's like it's just like the covid stuff. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2690.98s)]
*  It's science. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2694.62s)]
*  E. It's kind of science. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2695.46s)]
*  It kind of smells like science. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2698.06s)]
*  Like, yeah, isn't that it? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2699.94s)]
*  It's really a matter of how many calories you consume versus how many you burn. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2700.9s)]
*  But what's very convenient about that is that you're like, yeah, but calories of [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2705.14s)]
*  what? Which calories? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2709.14s)]
*  Because, you know, if you have calories from almonds or calories from a Big Mac, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2711.14s)]
*  it's not exactly the same. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2717.1s)]
*  Now, is it? I would say the as a compulsive eater who deals with the fats [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2718.74s)]
*  comes from a long line of fat. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2723.2599999999998s)]
*  The bigger problem with the calorie in calorie out perspective is [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2725.06s)]
*  the addictive quality of food. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2728.1s)]
*  So if you're giving the kid, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2729.66s)]
*  you're saying, hey, it doesn't matter what he eats. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2731.3799999999997s)]
*  So as long as it's under this amount of calories, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2732.7799999999997s)]
*  hand him the chocolate cake and the Coca Cola, as long as it's small portion, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2734.94s)]
*  you're getting a kid who's now wired for I need more chocolate cake and Coca Cola. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2738.18s)]
*  Well, that's that's 100 percent true. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2742.22s)]
*  But then in addition to that, it's not as if if you have [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2745.06s)]
*  and they go through this in the documentary. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2750.54s)]
*  But if you have like X amount of calories of [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2752.34s)]
*  of a Big Mac and then you have X amount of calories of like chicken breast, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2756.94s)]
*  it you can burn off the chicken breast calories way quicker than you can burn [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2762.26s)]
*  off the you know what I'm saying? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2766.94s)]
*  So it's not even like it's a whole different equation. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2767.98s)]
*  Anyway, that being said, I did kind of like that documentary. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2770.7400000000002s)]
*  Jessica Tarlov, the other person in this interview, I should full disclosure. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2774.1400000000003s)]
*  I've met many times and I like her very much. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2777.7000000000003s)]
*  She's a very nice person. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2779.7400000000002s)]
*  She is the and I don't mean to say this in an insulting way, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2781.1800000000003s)]
*  but she is the token liberal at Fox News or I don't know if she still works at Fox [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2784.78s)]
*  News, but she did for many years and she's essentially. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2789.26s)]
*  She's there like she's there to lose. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2794.54s)]
*  That's kind of the business model. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2797.94s)]
*  We have to pretend that we have one liberal here, you know, so it'll be four [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2800.34s)]
*  conservatives against her and then they all beat up on her every day. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2805.6200000000003s)]
*  But there is something about that. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2809.58s)]
*  I just every time I ever met her, she was always like just very, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2812.86s)]
*  very nice person and very kind and sweet. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2816.7400000000002s)]
*  And I guess you have to be to be the liberal at Fox News. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2820.1000000000004s)]
*  But she got, you know, so I have nothing bad to say about her. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2823.22s)]
*  But aside from maybe disagreeing with her politics. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2827.58s)]
*  But anyway, let's let's play that clip because I did find this interesting. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2831.62s)]
*  On the immigration front. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2836.14s)]
*  There was a tendency amongst Democrats and especially Democrats were discussing [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2838.5s)]
*  the issue, so people who do interviews or are part of the media to minimize it over [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2843.18s)]
*  the first two and a half years when there were a lot of people coming in here. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2848.2599999999998s)]
*  And I thought that it was a stunt, you know, when [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2854.02s)]
*  they started busing migrants, they go to Martha's Vineyards. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2857.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2860.8199999999997s)]
*  It was the smartest thing they ever did. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2862.02s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because I have a friend who lives in Florida and I said, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2863.74s)]
*  what did you think of Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2866.8599999999997s)]
*  taking some of these immigrants and moving them to northern states? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2872.06s)]
*  And she said, I thought it was great [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2876.18s)]
*  because nobody really was paying attention before that. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2878.38s)]
*  And I do think that this untold story was the strain on social services [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2883.02s)]
*  and communities, particularly along the border. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2889.7s)]
*  This influx, huge influx of immigrants was having. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2892.7s)]
*  And I think the mainstream media, however you define that these days, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2896.7799999999997s)]
*  kind of ignored that story to its peril. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2901.38s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2906.02s)]
*  they're certainly right about that. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2908.7000000000003s)]
*  I did think that was a I thought that was one of [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2911.1400000000003s)]
*  like the better moments that I've heard out of, like, people in the corporate [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2915.3s)]
*  media world giving a postmortem because they are actually dealing [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2919.5s)]
*  with one of the major issues that move people. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2923.54s)]
*  I would just say. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2926.1s)]
*  In addition to the point that they made, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2928.78s)]
*  what you want to get yourself into thinking about if you're people like [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2931.8999999999996s)]
*  Jessica and Katie here, it's like, why were you not able to see that at the time? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2936.2999999999997s)]
*  Why did you minimize it? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2941.02s)]
*  Me and you sat here on this show and called it the most brilliant [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2942.3399999999997s)]
*  political stunt we had ever seen. It was brilliant. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2946.7799999999997s)]
*  It was undeniable. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2950.18s)]
*  And it just so clearly worked the second they went there. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2951.22s)]
*  Everyone at Martha's Vineyard was [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2955.14s)]
*  outraged and they got rid of them the next day. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2956.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no kidding. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2959.06s)]
*  You gave the whole game away. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2960.46s)]
*  This is there used to be a popular [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2962.58s)]
*  phrase when I was a kid called limousine liberals. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2966.02s)]
*  And this is much like the term liberal. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2971.1800000000003s)]
*  This has kind of gone out of out of style. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2974.1800000000003s)]
*  But this is a huge, huge component to progressivism in general. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2977.6600000000003s)]
*  And it's something that makes voters white, hot, angry. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2985.1s)]
*  And justifiably so. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2990.02s)]
*  And this dynamic exists all over the place, all over the place. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2991.94s)]
*  And the reason why limousine liberal was an attack is not simply an attack like, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=2996.9s)]
*  oh, you're rich and you drive in a limousine. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3000.78s)]
*  The point was that you advocate for policies that you yourself are completely [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3002.7000000000003s)]
*  removed from the repercussions of. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3009.1400000000003s)]
*  Other people have to suffer through the repercussions of these policies. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3011.78s)]
*  And you see this all over the place. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3015.06s)]
*  Right. You see all of these people who advocate for [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3016.62s)]
*  global warming, jet travelers. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3021.5s)]
*  Exactly. They're a great example. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3023.42s)]
*  I advocate for climate change, but I fly on a private jet. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3025.02s)]
*  I advocate for open borders, but I have I live in a gated community. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3027.7799999999997s)]
*  I advocate for gun control, but I have armed security guards. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3032.7s)]
*  I advocate for degeneracy being taught in public schools. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3036.54s)]
*  But I send my kids to private schools. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3040.06s)]
*  This is all over the place. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3041.94s)]
*  It's constant that we saw during COVID that people advocating for mask mandates [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3043.82s)]
*  going out in public without masks, it's like there is something about that. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3048.46s)]
*  That level of hypocrisy. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3052.6600000000003s)]
*  And it's not just hypocrisy because hypocrisy is one thing. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3054.34s)]
*  Hypocrisy is like [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3057.5400000000004s)]
*  contradicting what your stated views are. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3059.5s)]
*  But this is actually imposing disastrous [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3062.7000000000003s)]
*  consequences on other people while you yourself don't have to suffer [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3066.1400000000003s)]
*  through them and then acting like you're morally superior to somebody for enforcing [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3070.1s)]
*  that. So everybody in border towns across this across the southern border [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3075.1s)]
*  have had to live through these policies and they get called bigots by these people [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3080.62s)]
*  in Martha's Vineyard. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3085.66s)]
*  But then the first day that there is an influx of migrants to Martha's Vineyard, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3086.82s)]
*  they're all up in arms and it actually gets taken care of. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3090.94s)]
*  Of course, that's going to move voters. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3093.46s)]
*  Listen, I do have to wrap up because I got to go watch my kid [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3095.34s)]
*  because my wife's got to go pick up the other one. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3099.66s)]
*  Thank you guys for tuning in. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3102.34s)]
*  Sorry about the mishap with the live episode. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3103.78s)]
*  We'll make sure to fix that for tomorrow. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3105.58s)]
*  All right. Catch you guys next time. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3107.54s)]
*  Peace. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sBtBZvetZs&t=3108.78s)]
