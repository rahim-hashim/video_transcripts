**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k)
*  What's up? What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the fire Bernstein. We are home for a brief window. How are you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=11.0s)]
*  doing today, sir? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=17.62s)]
*  I've never enjoyed being outside of Appleton this much in my whole life. Dave Smith, the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=18.62s)]
*  shows were a lot of fun. We met some great people out there. The shows were a great time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Not a lot going on. I love that comedy club. I think perhaps I'd like to try and film there [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  someday. It was really a great comedy club, but my God, I do. I think it might be done [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=34.28s)]
*  with Wisconsin. It might be, there's something about the energy of that state that just forces [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=40.0s)]
*  you to drink until you leave. It's like the opposite of spiritual energy. If somebody [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=44.5s)]
*  was to tell me they were like, they're like, ah, you know what? I'm quitting drinking. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm never going to drink again. I'd be like, ah, that's good for you, man. It's probably [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=54.32s)]
*  a healthy decision. You know, always better, better to do with, I mean, I love drinking, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=57.56s)]
*  but it's probably better not to, you know, and they were like, yeah, that's it. I'm never [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  going to drink again. And they were like, I live in Appleton, Wisconsin. I'd be like, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=64.52s)]
*  okay, that's retarded. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=68.36s)]
*  All right. First of all, it's impossible. It's impossible to be done. You cannot do [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=69.36s)]
*  it there. And second of all, why would you, why would you not drink there? Again, lovely [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=72.72s)]
*  people. Really enjoyed it. Had a great time at the, if you're, if you are out in that, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=77.4s)]
*  in that area, go to the skyline comedy club, right? Skyline. Yeah. That was the name of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=81.64s)]
*  it. Right. Yep. Skyline comedy club. Great place. They got to meet a lot of cool people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=85.56s)]
*  out there. So it was a lot of fun. I had trouble getting out there, but I made it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=90.08s)]
*  And I got porches this weekend, everybody. I'm out in Washington, D.C. I'm out in Virginia [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=93.16s)]
*  Beach here. I got to look at, look at all these porches, Davey Smith. I got so many. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  You can't even see all that is the view. But anyways, a lot of porches. And then next weekend [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=103.84s)]
*  is Virginia Beach, Washington, D.C. and somewhere out in Jersey. And then the following weekend [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=108.44s)]
*  run of Texas shows Rockport, Texas, Austin, Texas and San Antonio, Texas. There you go. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=113.28s)]
*  Hell yeah. Hell yeah, man. That's that's awesome. Then, of course, our next date together will [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=118.56s)]
*  be Salt Lake City at Wise Guys out there, which is a great, a great club, too. So looking [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=123.44s)]
*  forward to being back there. And of course, the event is sold out. However, they will [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=128.44s)]
*  be live streaming the debate. They are the great libertarian immigration debate the day [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=133.8s)]
*  after tomorrow at the Soho Forum. Really, really looking forward to this. It's going [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=139.82s)]
*  to be this is going to be a cool one, maybe not as high profile as some of the other debates [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=145.05999999999997s)]
*  that I've done. But I do think that it's a really important one. And I think within the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=151.1s)]
*  libertarian world, this is kind of a big, a big, you know, it's just a very important [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=155.28s)]
*  topic. Obviously, not only one of the most important topics in general is immigration, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=164.76s)]
*  but it's been, you know, either number one or number two, probably the most consequential [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=169.88s)]
*  policy areas in terms of, you know, getting Donald Trump elected. And I think it's really [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=176.88s)]
*  something that's it's important that libertarians get right on that issue. So I'm excited to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=180.6s)]
*  make the case for why libertarians ought to reject reject open borders and embrace immigration [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=184.68s)]
*  restrictions, common sense, just good old fashioned common sense. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=191.84s)]
*  I'm going to give my pitch before the show for open borders, but more opportunities for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=195.84s)]
*  a common folk to exploit Mexican labor. So there, well, Rob's also, you know, Rob might [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=200.0s)]
*  win the debate before I even get on stage. So we'll see. We'll see what happens to supposedly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=205.36s)]
*  tell jokes and I'm going to make my pitch for a better distribution of exploiting Mexican [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  labor. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=213.88s)]
*  Well, there you go. I look forward to hearing that as well. So that that should be a fun [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=214.88s)]
*  and I'm sure I'll see a lot of you guys out there at that event. So looking forward to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  it. And we're doing an after party at Gene's place. So come on out and party with me and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=223.72s)]
*  Rob party with us and our at an economist's loft where things get truly crazy. Okay. So [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=227.88s)]
*  for today's show, there's there's a lot going on. I believe as we speak, maybe it wrapped [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  up, but Donald Trump is in negotiations with Vladimir Putin, direct negotiations between [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=245.36s)]
*  the two of them. That's very interesting. I'm sure we'll we'll talk a lot about what [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=250.0s)]
*  comes of all of this. Of course, it was also announced that Joe Biden has cancer yesterday, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  which is another interesting development. And, you know, look, aside from look, anytime [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=260.92s)]
*  anyone has cancer, it's it's sad. Of course, politicians aren't people, but it's still [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=268.92s)]
*  sad. Even when politicians get cancer, it is in terms of the actual significance of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=274.92s)]
*  it. I'm you know, I have a tough time working up too much sympathy for anybody whose career [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=279.92s)]
*  was what Joe Biden's was. But it in terms of the political relevance of it, I think [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=287.16s)]
*  one of the things that's just kind of interesting is that it's it's like one more, you know, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=295.16s)]
*  do you remember Rob back in the day you ever watched like like the Warner Brothers cartoons, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=300.16s)]
*  you know, like Bugs Bunny and all them. And there'd be one thing where like one of the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=305.16s)]
*  cartoons would have like like Tom and Jerry or one of them would have like a million things [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=312.16s)]
*  stacked up and they're barely holding on to it. And then like a feather comes in and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=315.16s)]
*  just floats on the pile. And that's what breaks the whole thing. It does seem seem almost [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=319.16s)]
*  like that with just of the people who were actually arguing not that long ago that this [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=323.16s)]
*  guy should still be president, that he would be one hundred and twenty days or whatever [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=328.16s)]
*  it is into his second four years when he was so clearly in no position to like medically [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=333.16s)]
*  be able to do that is just one more thing of like another crisis that the nation would [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=341.16s)]
*  have faced if these insane people had gotten their way. So that's kind of my only thought [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=346.16s)]
*  on it. But anything you want to add from what I understand, it was an obscure medical [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=351.16s)]
*  event because he had a broken prostate inside of his brain. And that's that's usually not [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=356.16s)]
*  the way the prostate works where you also have dementia. That's usually not the way it [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=362.16s)]
*  works. But in this instance, he's one of the few cases where the broken prostate was, you [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=367.16s)]
*  know, ruining his intellect. No, the doctor found it while he was fingering his ear. He [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=372.16s)]
*  was like, something's not right in here. All right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=378.16s)]
*  The way if you put it up to the nation to decide if Joe Biden had one and then had to step [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=382.16s)]
*  down, I feel like the country would vote for his broken prostate over Kamala still. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=386.16s)]
*  He's still at this point still a better candidate than she is somehow. All right. So I wanted [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=392.16s)]
*  I wanted to start off a little bit by talking about this this Fox News interview with [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=397.16s)]
*  Cash Patel and Dan Bongino, which was very interesting to interview with the number one [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=403.16s)]
*  and number two people at the Justice Department or excuse me, at the FBI. And OK, one of the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=409.16s)]
*  things that was so interesting about this, of course, to me, as people who listen to the show [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=417.16s)]
*  know, this has been the probably the major theme of the last couple months for me has been this [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=422.16s)]
*  idea that, you know, the Donald Trump has put into positions of significant power many people [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=429.16s)]
*  who were the loudest whistleblowers, if you will, about the crimes being committed by the US [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=440.16s)]
*  federal government against the American people. And look, it's just when you look down the list [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=448.16s)]
*  of Tulsi Gabbard and Bobby Kennedy and Dan Bongino and Cash Patel, as well as others, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=454.16s)]
*  Pete Hegseth in there. These are people who have been talking about, I mean, with different [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=460.16s)]
*  degrees of specialty, but pretty much they've all been talking about all of them. The crimes that were [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=465.16s)]
*  committed in the Russiagate hoax with the covid unbelievable corruption and cover up during covid [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=470.16s)]
*  as well as, you know, lying the country into wars and all of these things. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=478.16s)]
*  And I think that look like, as I've said many times on the show before, I think this is the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=484.16s)]
*  appropriate framework to approach this conversation with. It's like, look, between just picking like [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=490.16s)]
*  some of the big ones, but between covid, Russiagate, the Epstein child sex trafficking ring, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=496.16s)]
*  and, you know, the wars that we've been lied into, the amount of crimes that have been committed by [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=502.16s)]
*  the government are just like enormous and profound. And then you have all of these people who have made [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=508.16s)]
*  names for themselves off calling out these crimes now in positions of power. And yet, still 120, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=514.1600000000001s)]
*  130 days in, we've seen no movement of the government to stop these crimes. And so, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=520.1600000000001s)]
*  what was particularly interesting to me about this interview is that I believe this is the first time [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=526.16s)]
*  really I've seen some of those people being killed in the way that they were being [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=532.16s)]
*  treated. And so, I think that's a very important thing to do. And I think that's a very important [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=538.16s)]
*  thing to do. And I think that's a very important thing to do. And I think that's a very important [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=544.16s)]

*  And so, right off the bat, that to me is very interesting. And so, let's kind of, we have a few clips here. I want to go through these and kind of respond to them. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=554.16s)]

*  If you're just asking to speculate, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=844.16s)]
*  can you even come up with a reason why I wouldn't tell you the truth? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=846.16s)]
*  There's 50 in my head right now. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=848.16s)]
*  Your family was threatened. You're part of it the whole time. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=850.16s)]
*  You got corrupted when you got in there. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=852.16s)]
*  They're not showing you the real information. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=854.16s)]
*  There's just a million reasons why [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=856.16s)]
*  you wouldn't be telling us the truth. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=858.16s)]
*  But this type of shit is not gonna work. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=860.16s)]
*  You can't just say [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=862.16s)]
*  look, present people with what the answers are to the relevant questions. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=864.16s)]
*  look, present people with what the answers are to the relevant questions. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=866.16s)]
*  That's the way to handle this here. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=868.16s)]
*  That's the way to handle this here. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=870.16s)]
*  Not to simply say there's no there, there. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=872.16s)]
*  Maybe there's not. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=874.16s)]
*  Maybe there are answers to how [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=876.16s)]
*  some kid [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=878.16s)]
*  is able to get a clean shot [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=880.16s)]
*  at the president's head from 130 yards away. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=882.16s)]
*  Maybe there's an answer for why we have [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=884.16s)]
*  videotapes of people, something like an hour [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=886.16s)]
*  before the shooting happened [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=888.16s)]
*  talking about how this guy is up on the roof. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=890.16s)]
*  talking about how this guy is up on the roof. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=892.16s)]
*  Maybe there's an answer to how the roof was too [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=894.16s)]
*  sloped for the Secret Service [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=896.16s)]
*  to be able to get on it and yet not too [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=898.16s)]
*  sloped for this kid to get on it [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=900.16s)]
*  and get a shot off. Maybe there is an answer [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=902.16s)]
*  to all of that. Maybe there's an answer [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=904.16s)]
*  to how any young person is [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=906.16s)]
*  so radicalized that they'd go try to [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=908.16s)]
*  assassinate the president but has no [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=910.16s)]
*  social media footprint. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=912.16s)]
*  Because that sure sounds like it doesn't exist. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=914.16s)]
*  And some shady phone records. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=916.16s)]
*  Yeah, and what, like, oh, okay, fine. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=918.16s)]
*  Maybe there's an answer to all of this. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=920.16s)]
*  But the answer is not [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=922.16s)]
*  gonna be accepted that anyone who gets in [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=924.16s)]
*  the government's goes, I've taken a look [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=926.16s)]
*  and I've determined it's nothing. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=928.16s)]
*  Why would I lie? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=930.16s)]
*  Look at me. It's me. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=932.16s)]
*  It's old Danny Bon Jean. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=934.16s)]
*  Why would I lie to you? Like, I'm sorry. That's just [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=936.16s)]
*  objectively that you gotta come with [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=938.16s)]
*  something a little bit better than that. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=940.16s)]
*  And, you know, the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=942.16s)]
*  to the people who are saying that [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=944.16s)]
*  like this in some way [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=946.16s)]
*  this in some way [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=948.16s)]
*  really demonstrates that there's no there [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=950.16s)]
*  there. It's like, I'm sorry. No, it doesn't. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=952.16s)]
*  It doesn't at all. Any thoughts, Rob? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=954.16s)]
*  And then you also had the Ukrainian guy. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=956.16s)]
*  The guy who was over in the Ukraine [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=958.16s)]
*  and then posted up outside of Donald Trump's [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=960.16s)]
*  the golf course to try and shoot him. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=962.16s)]
*  We haven't heard any more details [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=964.16s)]
*  about that guy since. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=966.16s)]
*  And what I thought was oddest about the first assassination [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=968.16s)]
*  attempt was Donald Trump's [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=970.16s)]
*  total unwillingness to even [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=972.16s)]
*  explore that our government [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=974.16s)]
*  or a government other than [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=976.16s)]
*  Iran was interested [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=978.16s)]
*  in assassinating him. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=980.16s)]
*  And the possibility that perhaps [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=982.16s)]
*  pressure was of [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=984.16s)]
*  a deal was made behind closed [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=986.16s)]
*  doors of, alright, we missed you. You can [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=988.16s)]
*  stick around, but we need this. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=990.16s)]
*  I'm just saying it seemed real odd [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=992.16s)]
*  the way that Donald Trump [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=994.16s)]
*  in interviews refused to say anything [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=996.16s)]
*  other than the Secret Service is [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=998.16s)]
*  great people. One of the things [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1000.16s)]
*  that was particularly strange about [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1002.16s)]
*  it is that Donald Trump [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1004.16s)]
*  the day [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1006.16s)]
*  that Donald Trump took that [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1008.16s)]
*  bullet to the ear. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1010.16s)]
*  You got to remember this is a couple days [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1012.16s)]
*  before Joe Biden dropped out of the race. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1014.16s)]
*  Joe Biden dropped out of the race [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1016.16s)]
*  as a result of that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1018.16s)]
*  Every bit as much as he dropped out as a result of the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1020.16s)]
*  debate. It was just like, oh my God, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1022.16s)]
*  Donald Trump looked so strong [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1024.1599999999999s)]
*  and so badass. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1026.1599999999999s)]
*  And coming off of how weak and frail Joe Biden [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1028.1599999999999s)]
*  looked, like the contrast was just [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1030.1599999999999s)]
*  too much. And everybody, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  everybody who [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  follows politics that day [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1036.1599999999999s)]
*  was like, Donald Trump's going to win this election. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1038.16s)]
*  There's just, that's, it's almost [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1040.16s)]
*  like, it looked like he was going to win before [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1042.16s)]
*  that, but after that it was like, there's just [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1044.16s)]
*  no way he's not going to lose the election. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1046.16s)]
*  Then they sub in Kamala Harris. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1048.16s)]
*  Then they have the most [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1050.16s)]
*  astroturfed campaign ever where [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1052.16s)]
*  they're trying to sell you that she is joy [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1054.16s)]
*  and hope and all this stuff. And then [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1056.16s)]
*  at least the polls, the public polls [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1058.16s)]
*  were saying that she was up [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1060.16s)]
*  for weeks. And [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1062.16s)]
*  this was like, Donald [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1064.16s)]
*  Trump almost allowed this [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1066.16s)]
*  story to rescind [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1068.16s)]
*  into the background rather than [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1070.16s)]
*  feigning the flames and keeping it alive [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1072.16s)]
*  when it was so clearly in [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1074.16s)]
*  his political interest to keep [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1076.16s)]
*  everybody talking about that. And the way [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1078.16s)]
*  he easily could have kept them talking about [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1080.16s)]
*  that was just speculating, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1082.16s)]
*  you know, going, hey, what, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1084.16s)]
*  which he does with everything else, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1086.16s)]
*  with everything else. Russiagate [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1088.16s)]
*  was a witch hunt by the deep state. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1090.16s)]
*  The, all the trials [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1092.16s)]
*  were, Donald Trump would be the first to tell you, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1094.16s)]
*  weaponizing of the justice system by [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1096.16s)]
*  a president who was his political [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1098.16s)]
*  opponent. Donald Trump never [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1100.16s)]
*  in his entire life, he was on [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1102.16s)]
*  the birtherism stuff about [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1104.16s)]
*  Obama. He was on the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1106.16s)]
*  Muslims were cheering [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1108.16s)]
*  in the streets during 9-11. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1110.16s)]
*  There was never a conspiracy that [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1112.16s)]
*  Donald Trump wouldn't fan the flames [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1114.16s)]
*  of if it was good for his political, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1116.16s)]
*  you know, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1118.16s)]
*  desires. And by the way, I'm not well [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1120.16s)]
*  with a couple of those. I mean, I never thought [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1122.16s)]
*  the birtherism thing [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1124.16s)]
*  made too much sense. And I didn't think the Muslims [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1126.16s)]
*  cheering, but like with the, with the Russiagate [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1128.16s)]
*  stuff and the weaponization of the political [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1130.16s)]
*  or the judicial system, that [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1132.16s)]
*  made total sense. But not [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1134.16s)]
*  with this one. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1136.16s)]
*  When it's so shady [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1138.16s)]
*  and everybody's wondering, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1140.16s)]
*  everybody's like, hey, what really happened [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1142.16s)]
*  there? And the fact that he doesn't [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1144.16s)]
*  touch it. He doesn't even say [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1146.16s)]
*  like, we're going to get to the bottom of [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1148.16s)]
*  this and know what happened. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1150.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1152.16s)]
*  Seems a little [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1154.16s)]
*  bit strange. That's all I'm saying. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1156.16s)]
*  Alright guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1158.16s)]
*  for today's show, which is Proton [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1160.16s)]
*  Mail. Proton Mail is an [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1162.16s)]
*  email service developed by Proton [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1164.16s)]
*  to replace your Gmail [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1166.16s)]
*  account for all of your important stuff [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1168.16s)]
*  so that you can have a more secure emailing [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1170.16s)]
*  experience. Your Gmail is [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1172.16s)]
*  full of junk anyway after all these years. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1174.16s)]
*  Why not start over, have a [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1176.16s)]
*  reset with Proton Mail, and then [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1178.16s)]
*  you'll be going forward with more security [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1180.16s)]
*  and peace of mind. Proton will [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1182.16s)]
*  always have a freemium version, and [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1184.16s)]
*  you can later change to a paid product if [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1186.16s)]
*  you're convinced about the product. But right [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1188.16s)]
*  now you can go create a product for free [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1190.16s)]
*  and you can continue using Gmail for [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1192.16s)]
*  garbage, but use Proton Mail for [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1194.16s)]
*  all your important stuff. Check them out today, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1196.16s)]
*  Proton Mail. Alright, let's get back [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1198.16s)]
*  into the show. All I'm saying is that [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1200.16s)]
*  if Dan Bongino is [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1202.16s)]
*  going, like if you, if you [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1204.16s)]
*  want to take the position, which is fairly [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1206.16s)]
*  reasonable, if you want to say like, look, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1208.16s)]
*  we've been talking about a lot of crimes [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1210.16s)]
*  that have been committed by the government over [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1212.16s)]
*  the last 10, 15 years. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1214.16s)]
*  There are many, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1216.16s)]
*  not every conspiracy theory [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1218.16s)]
*  is correct, and not every, you know [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1220.16s)]
*  what I mean, and we're going to get to the bottom of this. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1222.16s)]
*  You, the way [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1224.16s)]
*  to do that would be to [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1226.16s)]
*  number one, do something [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1228.16s)]
*  about the criminals that you've already [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1230.16s)]
*  said you know exist, actually [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1232.16s)]
*  have some type of like [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1234.16s)]
*  transparency [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1236.16s)]
*  and, and [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1238.16s)]
*  accountability for those people involved, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1240.16s)]
*  and then release actual [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1242.16s)]
*  information on this stuff. But [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1244.16s)]
*  what Dan Bongino just did, like this, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1246.16s)]
*  I'm going to get here and tell you, nothing to see there [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1248.16s)]
*  and you know that because [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1250.16s)]
*  it's obviously me, and the proof is that [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1252.16s)]
*  I'm the one telling you that, and really it's [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1254.16s)]
*  on you to explain why I wouldn't tell [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1256.16s)]
*  you that if I wasn't, like this [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1258.16s)]
*  is like non-arguments mixed [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1260.16s)]
*  with circular logic, you might as well not [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1262.16s)]
*  even say anything. This is not [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1264.16s)]
*  even beginning to address anything. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1266.16s)]
*  That's my feeling [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1268.16s)]
*  on that first clip there. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1270.16s)]
*  Alright, let's move over to [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1272.16s)]
*  the other clip that I sent where [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1274.16s)]
*  they're discussing Jeffrey Epstein [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1276.16s)]
*  as well as some other topics. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1278.16s)]
*  Which we were supposed to have [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1280.16s)]
*  all the details on that months ago, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1282.16s)]
*  and then a bunch of folders were [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1284.16s)]
*  handed off to influencers [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1286.16s)]
*  with Pam Bondi saying, if you had [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1288.16s)]
*  seen what I had seen and then not presenting [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1290.16s)]
*  us what she had seen, but hey, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1292.16s)]
*  most transparent administration [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1294.16s)]
*  cleaning up the deep state. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1296.16s)]
*  Yeah, like it's, I'm sorry, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1298.16s)]
*  it's just too ridiculous. Alright, here we go. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1300.16s)]
*  It actually happened [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1302.16s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1304.16s)]
*  So [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1306.16s)]
*  there is, as [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1308.16s)]
*  it seems that I [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1310.16s)]
*  find myself in a similar situation as Russiagate. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1312.16s)]
*  Because on January 6th in the prior Trump [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1314.16s)]
*  administration, I was the chief of staff to the Department of Defense. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1316.16s)]
*  And I spent four years in a minor fortune [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1318.16s)]
*  litigating the truth because [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1320.16s)]
*  people politicized what actually [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1322.16s)]
*  happened on January 6th. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1324.16s)]
*  And we now know unequivocally that [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1326.16s)]
*  President Trump lawfully [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1328.16s)]
*  authorized the deployment of [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1330.16s)]
*  National Guard and me as the head of the [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1332.16s)]
*  Office of the Secretary of Defense with the Secretary of Defense [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1334.16s)]
*  took that action. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1336.16s)]
*  When it finally came in, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1338.16s)]
*  because it had to have the governor [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1340.16s)]
*  and mayor of DC's approval [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1342.16s)]
*  on it, that's the way the law works. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1344.16s)]
*  And once it finally came in on January [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1346.16s)]
*  6th, remember we offered to them days [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1348.16s)]
*  before and then they rejected it. We put out the [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1350.16s)]
*  letters and your show has done great coverage [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1352.16s)]
*  showing how it was rejected. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1354.16s)]
*  We mobilized the fastest coal store in Washington, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1356.16s)]
*  DC since World War II. And the [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1358.16s)]
*  largest occupation of DC by the National Guard since [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1360.16s)]
*  the American Revolution. That's what happened [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1362.16s)]
*  on January 6th. But what you and your viewers want to know [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1364.16s)]
*  now that we've beat back [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1366.16s)]
*  that disinformation campaign with [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1368.16s)]
*  actual truth is what was the FBI [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1370.16s)]
*  doing? Well, we got answers [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1372.16s)]
*  coming. We just found a trove of information [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1374.16s)]
*  and it's on its way to Capitol Hill [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1376.16s)]
*  right now. And they've asked. And they're getting [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1378.16s)]
*  them and you're getting answers on January 6th. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1380.16s)]
*  You're getting answers on what [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1382.16s)]
*  sourcing was utilized, what money [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1384.16s)]
*  was utilized, how many assets [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1386.16s)]
*  were utilized, who made those decisions. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1388.16s)]
*  You're getting it. We can only control [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1390.16s)]
*  the FBI, but you're getting it from the FBI. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1392.16s)]
*  Were there FBI agents [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1394.16s)]
*  undercover egging people on? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1396.16s)]
*  Like I said, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1398.16s)]
*  that answer is coming. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1400.16s)]
*  And it's on its way to Congress. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1402.16s)]
*  You're about to... [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1404.16s)]
*  I saw it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1406.16s)]
*  I saw the portfolio of information. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1408.16s)]
*  We dug [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1410.16s)]
*  far and wide to find it. And I'm [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1412.16s)]
*  pretty sure now we have a conclusive [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1414.16s)]
*  definitive answer. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1416.16s)]
*  But you and the public [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1418.16s)]
*  are going to have it. You're going to see it [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1420.16s)]
*  in writing over to Capitol Hill. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1422.16s)]
*  But I just want to be sure we're [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1424.16s)]
*  clear, having been an agent and a police officer. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1426.16s)]
*  There is a difference [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1428.16s)]
*  between an agent. I know you know this. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1430.16s)]
*  I don't mean to sound ridiculous. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1432.16s)]
*  An agent, meaning a [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1434.16s)]
*  trained GS 1811 [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1436.16s)]
*  federal agent, and a [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1438.16s)]
*  source or an asset. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1440.16s)]
*  There's a difference. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1442.16s)]
*  So when you see the material, which I promise [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1444.16s)]
*  you is coming. Again, I might ask you to trust us. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1446.16s)]
*  I know it's coming, because I saw it yesterday. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1448.16s)]
*  When you see it, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1450.16s)]
*  I just want you to understand that. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1452.16s)]
*  It's not an apology for anything. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1454.16s)]
*  But there's a difference between agents [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1456.16s)]
*  and assets. And I just hope [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1458.16s)]
*  when people... [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1460.16s)]
*  Alright. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1462.16s)]
*  You know, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1464.16s)]
*  the thing is, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1466.16s)]
*  when you're just not [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1468.16s)]
*  asking someone, when you're not just asking someone [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1470.16s)]
*  to trust you, you don't have [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1472.16s)]
*  to say, I'm not just asking you [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1474.16s)]
*  to trust me, because you can point to [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1476.16s)]
*  something and show them, look, I'm not just asking you to [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1478.16s)]
*  trust me. Look, look at this. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1480.16s)]
*  But you don't have anything to look at. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1482.16s)]
*  And so, like, listen, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1484.16s)]
*  objectively speaking, yes, you're just asking [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1486.16s)]
*  us to trust you. That's exactly [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1488.16s)]
*  what's going on. And if you [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1490.16s)]
*  notice, they didn't say, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1492.16s)]
*  well, they did, they go, this information is [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1494.16s)]
*  on the way to you. By [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1496.16s)]
*  you, they mean Capitol Hill. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1498.16s)]
*  And so, look, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1500.16s)]
*  I'm not, I know there's people [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1502.16s)]
*  out there that trust the plan, people [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1504.16s)]
*  will always be telling me, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1506.16s)]
*  just be patient, just be patient, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1508.16s)]
*  trust the plan. Like, okay. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1510.16s)]
*  There's nothing I'm doing that, like, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1512.16s)]
*  conflicts with my patience. I [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1514.16s)]
*  will still be happy for any of this information [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1516.16s)]
*  if it comes out. But it does [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1518.16s)]
*  rub, I mean, this whole thing [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1520.16s)]
*  here, I'm sorry, this is, again, it's [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1522.16s)]
*  a non-response. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1524.16s)]
*  There's nothing here. Oh, we've [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1526.16s)]
*  seen it and there's some stuff. And whoo! [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1528.16s)]
*  When you find out about [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1530.16s)]
*  it, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1532.16s)]
*  you're going to be like, man, that was some stuff. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1534.16s)]
*  And then at the end, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1536.16s)]
*  what is this like? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1538.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, and this really is one of the problems. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1540.16s)]
*  You know, I remember [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1542.16s)]
*  this was, I forget exactly how this went down, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1546.16s)]
*  but I remember years ago during the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1548.16s)]
*  during the Russiagate days, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1550.16s)]
*  Rob, which were like, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1552.16s)]
*  that was like, really when you first [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1554.16s)]
*  came on the show, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1556.16s)]
*  that was like the Russiagate [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1558.16s)]
*  day, like our first few years of doing this podcast [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1560.16s)]
*  together. That was the big thing. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1562.16s)]
*  I mean, we focused on that more than anything [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1564.16s)]
*  else. You know, all these, you know, obviously [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1566.16s)]
*  I've always been known, you know, for the anti-war [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1568.16s)]
*  stuff. But [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1570.16s)]
*  since then, like we became kind of known [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1572.16s)]
*  for like COVID and [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1574.16s)]
*  Ukraine and Biden [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1576.16s)]
*  and, you know, like all this, all this [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1578.16s)]
*  other stuff. Obviously, the Israel-Gaza thing [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1580.16s)]
*  has become a big one for me. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1582.16s)]
*  But there was a time when [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1584.16s)]
*  that was kind of our calling card. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1586.16s)]
*  Like the thing that, the issue that we were [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1588.16s)]
*  associated with the most was calling bullshit [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1590.16s)]
*  on the Russiagate nonsense. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1592.16s)]
*  And I remember [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1594.16s)]
*  there were a bunch of people, Buck Sexton, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1596.16s)]
*  who's a former CIA employee. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1598.16s)]
*  He was also really great [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1600.16s)]
*  on the Russiagate stuff. And a lot [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1602.16s)]
*  of times people would say like, they'd be like, dude, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1604.16s)]
*  Dave, you and Buck are like the ones who are [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1606.16s)]
*  the best at breaking this down. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1608.16s)]
*  And I remember one time, I don't remember if we played [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1610.16s)]
*  the clip on the show or how it was, but so he [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1612.16s)]
*  does this whole thing, Buck [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1614.16s)]
*  Sexton, who I really like, by the way, I haven't [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1616.16s)]
*  talked to him in a while, but I always really like that guy. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1618.16s)]
*  But he does this whole thing. And this is because he's a [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1620.16s)]
*  former CIA agent. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1622.16s)]
*  This is kind of how he views it, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1624.16s)]
*  is that he would go through all this shit and like [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1626.16s)]
*  he's just dead right about everything, just breaking [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1628.16s)]
*  apart how crazy the whole Russia [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1630.16s)]
*  Trump collusion bullshit story [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1632.16s)]
*  was. And then at the [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1634.16s)]
*  end of it, he goes, and [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1636.16s)]
*  the worst part of all of this [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1638.16s)]
*  is that trust [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1640.16s)]
*  in the FBI and CIA has [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1642.16s)]
*  been completely lost and may never be [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1644.16s)]
*  recovered. And I thought [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1646.16s)]
*  it was kind of interesting because it was like, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1648.16s)]
*  you know, you're with someone like 99% [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1650.16s)]
*  of it, you completely [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1652.16s)]
*  agree with them. And then their conclusion [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1654.16s)]
*  from it is 180 [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1656.16s)]
*  degrees the opposite of your conclusion. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1658.16s)]
*  I would take all of the things [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1660.16s)]
*  he said, but then I'd say the only silver [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1662.16s)]
*  lining in this is that trust [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1664.16s)]
*  in the FBI and the CIA has been [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1666.16s)]
*  destroyed. And [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1668.16s)]
*  you know, someone could seem [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1670.16s)]
*  really, really good if they're good on everything [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1672.16s)]
*  up to that point, but there is a real problem [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1674.16s)]
*  if that's their takeaway. And you can already [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1676.16s)]
*  see this is what Dan Bongino's preempting. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1678.16s)]
*  He hasn't shown us anything. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1680.16s)]
*  And yet he's going, hey, just remember [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1682.16s)]
*  priority number one [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1684.16s)]
*  is don't confuse assets [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1686.16s)]
*  with agents. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1688.16s)]
*  So what? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1690.16s)]
*  We protect the reputation of the agents? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1692.16s)]
*  How about like, if the FBI [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1694.16s)]
*  had assets there, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1696.16s)]
*  not agents, but had [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1698.16s)]
*  assets there who were stoking [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1700.16s)]
*  January 6th, how about [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1702.16s)]
*  my reaction can just be like screw [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1704.16s)]
*  the FBI? Like why [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1706.16s)]
*  is my big concern here to make sure that I [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1708.16s)]
*  don't blame the agents? I don't blame [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1710.16s)]
*  the agents. They're only guilty [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1712.16s)]
*  of having assets to foment [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1714.16s)]
*  a fucking fake coup [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1716.16s)]
*  so that they could then run with that as the major [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1718.16s)]
*  story for the next couple years. And by the way, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1720.16s)]
*  if you remember back, use it [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1722.16s)]
*  as the centerpiece [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1724.16s)]
*  for launching a domestic war on [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1726.16s)]
*  terrorism and shutting down right-wing [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1728.16s)]
*  dissidents in the country. That's [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1730.16s)]
*  what it was used for. So like, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1732.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, if they did that, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1734.16s)]
*  why do you have to send this information [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1736.16s)]
*  to Congress? Release it [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1738.16s)]
*  to the people. Have Trump [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1740.16s)]
*  declassify it. Release [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1742.16s)]
*  it right to us. Like, I'm [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1744.16s)]
*  sorry, the problem with the trust the plan, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1746.16s)]
*  people, is that I've just been through this so many [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1748.16s)]
*  times and the plan never ends up coming to fruition. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1750.16s)]
*  So how about right now, when you [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1752.16s)]
*  actually have the power to do the right [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1754.16s)]
*  thing? Don't sit here and tell me to trust [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1756.16s)]
*  you, which even if you say you're not saying that, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1758.16s)]
*  is exactly what you're saying, objectively. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1760.16s)]
*  What am I missing here, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1762.16s)]
*  Rob? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1764.16s)]
*  I don't think you're missing anything, but just [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1766.16s)]
*  go a little bit further with what you were saying. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1768.16s)]
*  First is on the, remember that [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1770.16s)]
*  informants aren't [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1772.16s)]
*  agents, which that [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1774.16s)]
*  could also be why you purposely [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1776.16s)]
*  don't have them on the books as agents. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1778.16s)]
*  So the fact that you have [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1780.16s)]
*  informants on the ground [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1782.16s)]
*  and they're the ones, maybe you have evidence [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1784.16s)]
*  that they were actually provoking what was happening, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1786.16s)]
*  and you got the plausible deniability [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1788.16s)]
*  that they weren't agents, that [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1790.16s)]
*  means close to nothing to me. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1792.16s)]
*  You're basically just saying we orchestrated [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1794.16s)]
*  this in a way so that if things like this happen, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1796.16s)]
*  we can go, well that wasn't their directives [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1798.16s)]
*  from us. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1800.16s)]
*  Fine, great, you got a system where [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1802.16s)]
*  you always have plausible deniability and you're [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1804.16s)]
*  reinforcing it. Listen, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1806.16s)]
*  I hope that [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1808.16s)]
*  they make good on all these storylines and I [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1810.16s)]
*  think if there's enough public pressure, perhaps they [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1812.16s)]
*  will, but there's [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1814.16s)]
*  just another aspect that they're not even [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1816.16s)]
*  delving into here, because basically they're saying, listen, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1818.16s)]
*  I understand everyone's concerned about January 6th, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1820.16s)]
*  we got this new evidence, we just handed it over. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1822.16s)]
*  What about just all the conversation about the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1824.16s)]
*  amount of resources that went into prosecuting [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1826.16s)]
*  January 6th? There's a lot of crimes in this country [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1828.16s)]
*  that happen every single year, and a lot of [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1830.16s)]
*  them never go punished. We saw a lot of riots [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1832.16s)]
*  that happened in liberal areas with liberal people, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1834.16s)]
*  nobody got in trouble, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1836.16s)]
*  and for some reason on the January 6th one, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1838.16s)]
*  a lot of FBI resources [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1840.16s)]
*  went into, let's put all [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1842.16s)]
*  of them into jail. And so I would think [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1844.16s)]
*  part of the storyline would be, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1846.16s)]
*  who was making those decisions? How many [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1848.16s)]
*  resources got put into it? How many other things [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1850.16s)]
*  weren't taken care of? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1852.16s)]
*  How many kids got child traffic [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1854.16s)]
*  because the FBI was using all their time [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1856.16s)]
*  dealing with who was trespassing [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1858.16s)]
*  on January 6th? And then if [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1860.16s)]
*  you've also got a little bit of even a loose storyline [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1862.16s)]
*  of our informants were there and [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1864.16s)]
*  doing it, I don't know, how much [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1866.16s)]
*  of an investigation are you guys doing into, whether [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1868.16s)]
*  or not there was a coordinated effort [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1870.16s)]
*  to create this false domestic terrorism [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1872.16s)]
*  title so that you could further [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1874.16s)]
*  prosecute the American people without [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1876.16s)]
*  due process? I mean, unless you're going to [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1878.16s)]
*  have that conversation, you [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1880.16s)]
*  are not serious about this. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1882.16s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right, Rob. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1884.16s)]
*  You're exactly right because, look, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1886.16s)]
*  if you think about it, even the part, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1888.16s)]
*  the kind of, whether intentional [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1890.16s)]
*  or unintentional, the limited [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1892.16s)]
*  hangout that Cash Patel [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1894.16s)]
*  is giving you, which is that like, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1896.16s)]
*  oh, I know for a fact that we [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1898.16s)]
*  wanted all this extra security [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1900.16s)]
*  to be there and that they turned it [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1902.16s)]
*  down. Well, the only reason why that's [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1904.16s)]
*  an interesting nugget is like, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1906.16s)]
*  well, why did they do that? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1908.16s)]
*  Wait, you're saying before [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1910.16s)]
*  the fact they wanted [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1912.16s)]
*  there to not be enough security here? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1914.16s)]
*  Oh, it kind of seems like they wanted an incident [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1916.16s)]
*  to happen. Okay. Well, what [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1918.16s)]
*  other prongs were involved in this then? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1920.16s)]
*  And if you're telling me that they intentionally [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1922.16s)]
*  didn't want the security, then had [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1924.16s)]
*  provocateurs there, and then [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1926.16s)]
*  the entire media went into overdrive [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1928.16s)]
*  about January 6th [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1930.16s)]
*  and literally you had political leaders out [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1932.16s)]
*  there repeating the script that it was worse [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1934.16s)]
*  than the 9-11, that [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1936.16s)]
*  it was another Pearl Harbor, right? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1938.16s)]
*  Wasn't that Kamala Harris's line or something [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1940.16s)]
*  like that? It's like, okay, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1942.16s)]
*  what you're saying [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1944.16s)]
*  is pointing to this [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1946.16s)]
*  huge conspiracy. Also, how about [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1948.16s)]
*  like the whole thing where there were those [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1950.16s)]
*  pipe bombs? Those mysterious, yeah, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1952.16s)]
*  the mysterious package bombs that [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1954.16s)]
*  happened to be planted that same day that then [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1956.16s)]
*  we're just supposed to forget that ever [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1958.16s)]
*  happened? They don't even have the dignity [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1960.16s)]
*  to lie to me and go, we're having [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1962.16s)]
*  a massive investigation here. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1964.16s)]
*  No one's answered for the pipe bombs yet. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1966.16s)]
*  We'd like to know the relationship between media [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1968.16s)]
*  and Ray Epps and as to why that individual [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1970.16s)]
*  was given a sweetheart plea deal, and [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1972.16s)]
*  that while the media was egregiously [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1974.16s)]
*  saying that everyone else needs to be in jail, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1976.16s)]
*  why is the right wing of America [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1978.16s)]
*  giving a hard time to this person? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1980.16s)]
*  We'd like to know why. We've [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1982.16s)]
*  looked at a lot of the footage. We want to know why some doors [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1984.16s)]
*  were opened when they were opened. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1986.16s)]
*  We've got a lot of things that we need to uncover [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1988.16s)]
*  here, and that's why we're looking into it. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1990.16s)]
*  At least that is a good lie, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1992.16s)]
*  because you're pretending like you care. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1994.16s)]
*  But when you're not even making a conversation about [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1996.16s)]
*  actually looking to [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=1998.16s)]
*  at least debunk the conspiracy [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2000.16s)]
*  that the government was purposely [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2002.16s)]
*  involved in January 6, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2004.16s)]
*  to try and make Trump look bad [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2006.16s)]
*  and potentially have a domestic terrorism title [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2008.16s)]
*  to go after people like us, I don't know. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2010.16s)]
*  It just doesn't sound like you guys are that serious about this topic. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2012.16s)]
*  Yeah, and like somebody, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2014.16s)]
*  please, go make a compilation [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2016.16s)]
*  of all the stuff these guys were saying about this [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2018.16s)]
*  over the last few years. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2020.16s)]
*  Because it seems to me like, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2022.16s)]
*  you can't look, if what Cash Patel is saying [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2024.16s)]
*  is just something like, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2026.16s)]
*  oh, this was just incompetence. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2028.16s)]
*  Like, Nancy Pelosi [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2030.16s)]
*  and these guys, they didn't want the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2032.16s)]
*  Metro police there, and you know, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2034.16s)]
*  they didn't even think it would be [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2036.16s)]
*  a thing, and then look at them at work. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2038.16s)]
*  But it seems pretty clear that Cash Patel is [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2040.16s)]
*  fanning the flames up a little bit more than just that. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2042.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2044.16s)]
*  But you can't do that anymore if you're the FBI [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2046.16s)]
*  director, or you got to admit [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2048.16s)]
*  that like, there's a power structure that goes [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2050.16s)]
*  way beyond the FBI director here, you know what I mean? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2052.16s)]
*  Like, I don't have the power that you think I would. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2054.16s)]
*  But if you're still Mr. Truth Teller [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2056.16s)]
*  and you guys can still say, no, listen, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2058.16s)]
*  you can trust me because this is me here, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2060.16s)]
*  well then like, what are you saying? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2062.16s)]
*  You're saying they didn't want the [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2064.16s)]
*  backup there. Why not? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2066.16s)]
*  That seems like the point of you [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2068.16s)]
*  bringing it up is that this indicates a much wider [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2070.16s)]
*  conspiracy, but if that's the case, then [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2072.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, but you're just going to say, oh, we're sending [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2074.16s)]
*  some documents to Congress? Okay. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2076.16s)]
*  Like, yes, Rob, if you were [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2078.16s)]
*  right, if you're going to lie to me, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2080.16s)]
*  or if you think you're telling the truth, whatever, tell [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2082.16s)]
*  me something. Give me a [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2084.16s)]
*  date by which when I can expect [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2086.16s)]
*  to know this stuff. When is [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2088.16s)]
*  it going to be released to the public? When will we [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2090.16s)]
*  have the answers to this? When will we need [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2092.16s)]
*  to remember the difference between agent [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2094.16s)]
*  and asset? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2096.16s)]
*  Or if, like you said, if they were [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2098.16s)]
*  going to say, hey, we're launching this real deal investigation, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2100.16s)]
*  something, but this is just [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2102.16s)]
*  kind of nothing. All right, guys, let's take a moment [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2104.16s)]
*  and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2106.16s)]
*  which is Hexclad. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2108.16s)]
*  If you've been trying to eat healthier [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2110.16s)]
*  by cooking at home and not always [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2112.16s)]
*  going out or not eating microwavable [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2114.16s)]
*  meals, you need some good [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2116.16s)]
*  pots and pans, and that's [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2118.16s)]
*  where Hexclad comes in. I will tell you [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2120.16s)]
*  personally, they send a couple pounds over [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2122.16s)]
*  to us. My wife loves them, and [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2124.16s)]
*  she is a pan snob, so this is [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2126.16s)]
*  good quality stuff here. Go check [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2128.16s)]
*  them out. Hexclad has completely [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2130.16s)]
*  revolutionized pots and pans [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2132.16s)]
*  by combining the performance [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2134.16s)]
*  of stainless steel with the convenience [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2136.16s)]
*  and easy cleanup of non-stick, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2138.16s)]
*  but Hexclad's innovation doesn't [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2140.16s)]
*  stop there. Their Japanese [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2142.16s)]
*  Damascus steel knives are as sharp [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2144.16s)]
*  as they are tough, perfect for leveling [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2146.16s)]
*  up your meal prep. Their [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2148.16s)]
*  sleek peppermill lets you season [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2150.16s)]

*  The Epstein-Pam Bondi thing. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2186.16s)]
*  Well, yeah, more time for [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2188.16s)]
*  the FBI to sit through it. And it's not [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2190.16s)]
*  that they're trying to clean up the record or redact at [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2192.16s)]
*  all. And no one's ever been more serious about [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2194.16s)]
*  giving us this information and the transparency. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2196.16s)]
*  But wasn't the same thing [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2198.16s)]
*  the same thing about Epstein. We need more [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2200.16s)]
*  time now. Like after she got pushed back [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2202.16s)]
*  because those influencers had nothing. Oh, give it [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2204.16s)]
*  time. Give it time. It's coming. It's like, oh, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2206.16s)]
*  all right. We have been [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2208.16s)]
*  giving you time. I mean, I don't know. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2210.16s)]
*  Like, I'm not unreasonable with this shit. I'm [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2212.16s)]
*  still that Trump's negotiating with [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2214.16s)]
*  Putin today. I hope he fucking [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2216.16s)]
*  negotiates an end to this war. I'm not sitting [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2218.16s)]
*  here and going, hey, you said day [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2220.16s)]
*  one it would be done. And now it's day 130 [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2222.16s)]
*  and it's still not done. Like, all right. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2224.16s)]
*  I understand it's not going to be done on day one. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2226.16s)]
*  When do when are we looking [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2228.16s)]
*  at this, guys? This isn't [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2230.16s)]
*  something like negotiating an end to a war [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2232.16s)]
*  where you need the other person to get on board [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2234.16s)]
*  with the negotiations. It's like [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2236.16s)]
*  release it. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2238.16s)]
*  By the way, I was wrong when we led that up. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2240.16s)]
*  That wasn't the Epstein one. Can you I think it was one [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2242.16s)]
*  of the ones that Rob said, Natalie, I think it was [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2244.16s)]
*  the one of those was the [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2246.16s)]
*  Epstein one because that that one's worth playing. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2248.16s)]
*  Also, let's [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2250.16s)]
*  you can trust them [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2252.16s)]
*  once again. They're right. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2254.16s)]
*  And they've seen that they can't show [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2256.16s)]
*  us, but they've seen but just trust [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2258.16s)]
*  us. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2260.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's the last one that Rob [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2262.16s)]
*  said, Natalie. Let's let's play that one. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2264.16s)]
*  They're they're trying to get some of that Donald Trump [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2268.16s)]
*  divinity credit of just [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2270.16s)]
*  listen, typically speaking, don't trust [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2272.16s)]
*  government. And when they say something, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2274.16s)]
*  it's a fine questions and look for the [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2276.16s)]
*  evidence except with Donald Trump, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2278.16s)]
*  in which case you're just [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2280.16s)]
*  you know, what do they say? You just got [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2282.16s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome. If you'd [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2284.16s)]
*  like to see the evidence on things, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2286.16s)]
*  if you just ask the typical questions, you would ask a [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2288.16s)]
*  government and go, hey, can I ask a clarifying [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2290.16s)]
*  question? Do you have a reason behind that? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2292.16s)]
*  Do you have some evidence to that? If you ask that about [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2294.16s)]
*  Donald Trump, it's that you just [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2296.16s)]
*  don't pay tribute to his divinity. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2298.16s)]
*  Yeah, they said hold on one second. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2302.16s)]
*  She Natalie said that [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2304.16s)]
*  that should be a quick [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2306.16s)]
*  fine. It was it was floating around. If you [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2308.16s)]
*  just do cash, but tell [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2310.16s)]
*  Epstein killed himself, you should be able to [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2312.16s)]
*  quickly. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2314.16s)]
*  Sure. I'll find [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2316.16s)]
*  it. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2318.16s)]
*  Here I'll send it over to you now, Natalie. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2328.16s)]
*  Here you go. I just I just texted [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2332.16s)]
*  it over to you. Go [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2334.16s)]
*  because this this one to me was like [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2336.16s)]
*  one of the the real interesting ones that I just [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2338.16s)]
*  thought like we kind of had to play this [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2340.16s)]
*  and respond to it because look, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2342.16s)]
*  I'm not trying to jump to conclusions [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2344.16s)]
*  about Bon Gino or cash Patel. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2346.16s)]
*  Like I said, I like both [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2348.16s)]
*  these guys. I've said nice things about them. I [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2350.16s)]
*  supported both of them to jump to the back of his head. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2352.16s)]
*  That does it does look like it's been [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2354.16s)]
*  frightened by something. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2356.16s)]
*  But you're like, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2358.16s)]
*  look, guys, like [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2360.16s)]
*  I'm just telling you what I'm looking [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2362.16s)]
*  at here. And it looks like [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2364.16s)]
*  OK, there these guys who have been calling out [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2366.16s)]
*  this stuff are on the inside now. And now [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2368.16s)]
*  rather than actually giving us any information, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2370.16s)]
*  they're just downplaying [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2372.16s)]
*  all of this stuff. So what it seems like to me [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2374.16s)]
*  here, let's play this one. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2376.16s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2378.16s)]
*  People don't believe it. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2380.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, they [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2382.16s)]
*  have a right to their opinion. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2384.16s)]
*  But as someone who has worked as [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2386.16s)]
*  a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2388.16s)]
*  that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2390.16s)]
*  Detention Center, who's been in segregated [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2392.16s)]
*  housing, you know, a suicide [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2394.16s)]
*  when you see one. And that's what that was. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2396.16s)]
*  Can you just even pause here? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2398.16s)]
*  You might as well play it there because it just looks [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2402.16s)]
*  retarded. It's a bad one. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2404.16s)]
*  I've seen the whole file. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2406.16s)]
*  He killed himself. I know it's hard work. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2408.16s)]
*  You said [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2410.16s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2412.16s)]
*  Well, you can see inside. Well, we can't [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2414.16s)]
*  because the tapes were turned off. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2416.16s)]
*  So you actually you can't. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2418.16s)]
*  So what exactly is [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2420.16s)]
*  this new specific evidence? Because [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2422.16s)]
*  we did have this guy who seems to be an intelligence [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2424.16s)]
*  asset who after they want [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2426.16s)]
*  after they lost that freedom of information thing [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2428.16s)]
*  about the prosecution, suddenly the FBI turns [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2430.16s)]
*  around and goes, yeah, we got to get this guy [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2432.16s)]
*  and they get him in jail. They take the safe out of his [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2434.16s)]
*  apartment. It magically disappears. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2436.16s)]
*  And then this guy's in jail and [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2438.16s)]
*  magically all the cameras turn off [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2440.16s)]
*  when he decides to kill himself in his own [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2442.16s)]
*  cell. And all that you have to say, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2444.16s)]
*  well, trust me, because I looked at what did you look at? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2446.16s)]
*  What do you see? There are no tapes. You look at the [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2448.16s)]
*  report about the prison guards who were napping [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2450.16s)]
*  and, you know, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2452.16s)]
*  playing with their crumbs in the pot [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2454.16s)]
*  in the whatever they were doing, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2456.16s)]
*  reading some old news. Also just look [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2458.16s)]
*  it all just comes down to trust [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2460.16s)]
*  me. They're saying nothing. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2462.16s)]
*  They're sitting there saying it's I mean, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2464.16s)]
*  there's well, I know the other clip they were like, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2466.16s)]
*  I'm not saying just trust me, but they're like, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2468.16s)]
*  look, people are entitled to their opinion. I know [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2470.16s)]
*  the case. I've seen the case. He killed [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2472.16s)]
*  himself. What the [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2474.16s)]
*  fuck is that? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2476.16s)]
*  Listen, I mean, again, what we [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2478.16s)]
*  know about Jeffrey Epstein, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2480.16s)]
*  right? And with [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2482.16s)]
*  all these intelligence [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2484.16s)]
*  operations, very rarely are [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2486.16s)]
*  we ever going to find out all of the details [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2488.16s)]
*  or know the entire story. But [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2490.16s)]
*  we know more than enough to know that [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2492.16s)]
*  this thing stinks to high [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2494.16s)]
*  heavens. I mean, the guy is [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2496.16s)]
*  if you just go through his life, it's like [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2498.16s)]
*  the guy is with like [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2500.16s)]
*  no credentials. He's [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2502.16s)]
*  a he's a [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2504.16s)]
*  teacher at Dalton, like [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2506.16s)]
*  the most like privileged [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2508.16s)]
*  private school in Manhattan [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2510.16s)]
*  where he gets a few complaints [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2512.16s)]
*  from young girls [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2514.16s)]
*  who are there. Then he winds up [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2516.16s)]
*  at Bayer Stearns and within like [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2518.16s)]
*  a year and a half, he's like on [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2520.16s)]
*  partner level. He's [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2522.16s)]
*  worth a ton of money [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2524.16s)]
*  involved in the biggest deals. And it's [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2526.16s)]
*  nobody knows how he made his money [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2528.16s)]
*  or who he was involved with. The [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2530.16s)]
*  he's connected to a lot of [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2532.16s)]
*  people who have connections [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2534.16s)]
*  to intelligence themselves. We know [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2536.16s)]
*  that when he is first caught, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2538.16s)]
*  the prosecutor says [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2540.16s)]
*  we gave him a sweetheart deal because he [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2542.16s)]
*  was connected to intelligence. We know [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2544.16s)]
*  that he is connected to [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2546.16s)]
*  like all of the people at the [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2548.16s)]
*  top levels of politics and culture [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2550.16s)]
*  and business. And we know [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2552.16s)]
*  that there that [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2554.16s)]
*  his file is largely redacted [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2556.16s)]
*  for national security reasons. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2558.16s)]
*  Why the hell would a [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2560.16s)]
*  pedophile ring need to have redacted [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2562.16s)]
*  information for national security [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2564.16s)]
*  purposes? And yes, we also [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2566.16s)]
*  know that the way he died is incredibly [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2568.16s)]
*  suspicious with [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2570.16s)]
*  being like in this maximum [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2572.16s)]
*  security prison where he should be the most [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2574.16s)]
*  untouchable person. And then you have multiple [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2576.16s)]
*  camera failures and he [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2578.16s)]
*  commits suicide after being [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2580.16s)]
*  assaulted in jail. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2582.16s)]
*  And then, you know, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2584.16s)]
*  multiple people claiming [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2586.16s)]
*  that he believed he was getting [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2588.16s)]
*  out and was not at all suicidal. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2590.16s)]
*  Now, to be very clear, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2592.16s)]
*  and I think this is true at the [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2594.16s)]
*  heart of the Jeffrey Epstein [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2596.16s)]
*  didn't kill himself meme, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2598.16s)]
*  I don't actually think [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2600.16s)]
*  necessarily that anyone is [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2602.16s)]
*  strictly saying there's no way the guy [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2604.16s)]
*  killed himself. I'm open [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2606.16s)]
*  to the idea that Jeffrey Epstein did kill himself. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2608.16s)]
*  I don't think he did it [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2610.16s)]
*  on his own volition. Like, I don't think [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2612.16s)]
*  there's nothing more to the story there. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2614.16s)]
*  But I'm sorry, like, dude, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2616.16s)]
*  like, if [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2618.16s)]
*  at my house, right, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2620.16s)]
*  we got, I got a ton of cameras [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2622.16s)]
*  around the property on my house. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2624.16s)]
*  If all of my cameras went off and [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2626.16s)]
*  then you found me having committed [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2628.16s)]
*  suicide there, you'd be like, yo, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2630.16s)]
*  something here happened. That's like too [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2632.16s)]
*  weird that that would happen right in [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2634.16s)]
*  concert with this happening. But [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2636.16s)]
*  again, Patel [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2638.16s)]
*  and Bongino here are doing nothing. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2640.16s)]
*  They're not telling us we're [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2642.16s)]
*  going to get more. They're not even saying [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2644.16s)]
*  what they said about the January 6th stuff. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2646.16s)]
*  They're not even going, oh, information is on its way [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2648.16s)]
*  to Congress. They're just like, no, didn't [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2650.16s)]
*  happen. I know what I'm talking about. I looked [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2652.16s)]
*  at it. I saw it. This is [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2654.16s)]
*  this is worse [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2656.16s)]
*  than not saying anything [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2658.16s)]
*  about it. It's worse than just [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2660.16s)]
*  not commenting on it again. To get [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2662.16s)]
*  together, be asked this question [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2664.16s)]
*  and have nothing other than [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2666.16s)]
*  like, no, he did. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2668.16s)]
*  He did. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2670.16s)]
*  I mean, come on. Like, what are we supposed [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2672.16s)]
*  to, what are we supposed to think about this? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2674.16s)]
*  And I see a lot of people on Twitter, you know, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2676.16s)]
*  being like, now I give them time. These are [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2678.16s)]
*  the good guys. They're in there. It's like, okay, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2680.16s)]
*  fine. But to anyone who's making [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2682.16s)]
*  that argument, just give me a specific amount [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2684.16s)]
*  of time. How much time do I have to [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2686.16s)]
*  give them? And at what [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2688.16s)]
*  period in time when we don't get the [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2690.16s)]
*  answers to any of this shit? And I'm not [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2692.16s)]
*  saying we don't get the answers we want. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2694.16s)]
*  If you're telling me these are not conspiracies [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2696.16s)]
*  and then fine, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2698.16s)]
*  then give us the evidence that they're not. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2700.16s)]
*  You know, but if that [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2702.16s)]
*  doesn't happen and we're left knowing [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2704.16s)]
*  exactly what we were left 130 [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2706.16s)]
*  days ago about Epstein [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2708.16s)]
*  and January 6th and all of this stuff, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2710.16s)]
*  when do you admit that the plan [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2712.16s)]
*  isn't working? That's a question [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2714.16s)]
*  from my follow the plan [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2716.16s)]
*  people out there. All right, guys, let's take [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2718.16s)]
*  a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2720.16s)]
*  which is CrowdHealth, a [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2722.16s)]
*  longtime sponsor. I love this company. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2724.16s)]
*  Let's just start by asking, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2726.16s)]
*  is anyone out there really thrilled [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2728.16s)]
*  with their health care insurance provider? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2730.16s)]
*  Nobody? Yeah, that's [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2732.16s)]
*  right. The answer is always nobody. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2734.16s)]
*  And we know the reason. It's a [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2736.16s)]
*  broken system, largely [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2738.16s)]
*  because of government intervention. But now [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2740.16s)]
*  there is an alternative [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2742.16s)]
*  to health insurance, and that is [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2744.16s)]
*  CrowdHealth. CrowdHealth is a decentralized [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2746.16s)]
*  health care payment system [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2748.16s)]
*  that frees you from the tyranny of [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2750.16s)]
*  health insurance. It's significantly [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2752.16s)]
*  less expensive than health insurance. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2754.16s)]
*  It's significantly less expensive than health [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2756.16s)]
*  insurance. They cut out the middlemen. Some [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2758.16s)]
*  say that's upward of 40% of the [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2760.16s)]
*  costs of health insurance. With [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2762.16s)]
*  CrowdHealth, singles are about [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2764.16s)]
*  $185 a month. A family [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2766.16s)]
*  of four is $605 [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2768.16s)]
*  a month. And if you use the promo [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2770.16s)]
*  code POTP, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2772.16s)]
*  you can get $99 [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2774.16s)]
*  a month per person for the next [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2776.16s)]
*  three months. CrowdHealth is not [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2778.16s)]
*  health insurance. It's a totally different [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2780.16s)]
*  way of paying for health care. Terms [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2782.16s)]
*  and conditions may apply. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2784.16s)]
*  Just remember, head over to join [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2786.16s)]
*  crowdhealth.com and make sure [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2788.16s)]
*  to use the promo code POTP [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2790.16s)]
*  to get [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2792.16s)]
*  that deal $99 [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2794.16s)]
*  a month per person for the first three [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2796.16s)]
*  months. Alright, let's get back into the show. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2798.16s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2800.16s)]
*  Anything else on this, Rob? It's just [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2802.16s)]
*  to me, it's disappointing isn't [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2804.16s)]
*  even the right word, but it's just like [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2806.16s)]
*  it's a lot meet the new boss [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2808.16s)]
*  type energy. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2810.16s)]
*  This is what you get. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2812.16s)]
*  I would just say at a minimum, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2814.16s)]
*  the storyline [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2816.16s)]
*  that the government was working against [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2818.16s)]
*  Donald Trump and the American people is a [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2820.16s)]
*  sexy storyline. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2822.16s)]
*  Why are you abandoning it? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2824.16s)]
*  It's partly how you won the election. People [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2826.16s)]
*  were really into that storyline of, hey, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2828.16s)]
*  the government's working against this guy that I [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2830.16s)]
*  voted for. What's going on here? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2832.16s)]
*  Can we get this thing cleaned up? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2834.16s)]
*  And that's kind of part of their pitch [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2836.16s)]
*  to the American people is that they were going to do so. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2838.16s)]
*  When they get in and then it's just, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2840.16s)]
*  no, everything's fine here. It was all good. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2842.16s)]
*  We're moving forward. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2844.16s)]
*  I don't know. They seem to be channeling [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2846.16s)]
*  to me that they [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2848.16s)]
*  uprooting the deep state [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2850.16s)]
*  and looking into what they did [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2852.16s)]
*  to Donald Trump is actually not on their [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2854.16s)]
*  list of priorities. And it's interesting [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2856.16s)]
*  for them to abandon that because [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2858.16s)]
*  there's political capital in taking that one on. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2860.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2862.16s)]
*  They're working against their own interest [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2864.16s)]
*  to protect criminals in the government. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2866.16s)]
*  Seems kind of [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2868.16s)]
*  fishy. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2870.16s)]
*  I wanted to talk about this. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2872.16s)]
*  We're going to make sure we do this on [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2874.16s)]
*  today's show because it was, I did find [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2876.16s)]
*  this to be a very interesting [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2878.16s)]
*  moment. So, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2880.16s)]
*  my friend, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2882.16s)]
*  my friends, I [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2884.16s)]
*  should say, over [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2886.16s)]
*  the last few years, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2888.16s)]
*  I've been very interested in [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2890.16s)]
*  the fact that the [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2892.16s)]
*  prominent flagrant [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2894.16s)]
*  had Bernie Sanders [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2896.16s)]
*  on the podcast, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2898.16s)]
*  which was, you know, this has been [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2900.16s)]
*  interesting. I obviously, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2902.16s)]
*  as we've been talking about for quite a while, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2904.16s)]
*  I'm very fascinated by [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2906.16s)]
*  the, you know, the rise of the [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2908.16s)]
*  podcast world as the kind of [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2910.16s)]
*  dominant [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2912.16s)]
*  media. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2914.16s)]
*  And I've been very interested in [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2916.16s)]
*  that since the election. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2918.16s)]
*  And of course, there's been [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2920.16s)]
*  stuff that we've talked about before on the show. Gavin [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2922.16s)]
*  Newsom starting his own podcast. Just recently, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2924.16s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg went on [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2926.16s)]
*  flagrant with Akash [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2928.16s)]
*  and Andrew Schultz. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2930.16s)]
*  And that I did think was kind [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2932.16s)]
*  of an interesting development. It's just, it's kind of fascinating [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2934.16s)]
*  to me that they realized they have to play [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2936.16s)]
*  this game now. And I think that's one [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2938.16s)]
*  of the [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2940.16s)]
*  more monumental [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2942.16s)]
*  developments that we've had over the last [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2944.16s)]
*  couple hundred days. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2946.16s)]
*  And I think it's going to have [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2948.16s)]
*  a profound effect on politics [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2950.16s)]
*  and who can be a successful politician. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2952.16s)]
*  Not necessarily that that means [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2954.16s)]
*  that only the best will [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2956.16s)]
*  rise, but there is a certain type of [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2958.16s)]
*  person you have to be, like someone who can go on [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2960.16s)]
*  a podcast and grapple with Andrew Schultz [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2962.16s)]
*  and deal with the type of questions [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2964.16s)]
*  he's going to throw at you. And now [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2966.16s)]
*  they just had Bernie Sanders on. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2968.16s)]
*  And, you know, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2970.16s)]
*  it's kind of like a broader theme, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2972.16s)]
*  but I remember getting [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2974.16s)]
*  in, I got in a few arguments, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2976.16s)]
*  like behind the scenes arguments with people who are [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2978.16s)]
*  like pretty, you know, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2980.16s)]
*  pretty [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2982.16s)]
*  well known figures [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2984.16s)]
*  in corporate media. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2986.16s)]
*  And, you know, they'd be saying [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2988.16s)]
*  like, oh, but this is [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2990.16s)]
*  horrible because, you know, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2992.16s)]
*  sure, the media has had [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2994.16s)]
*  some issues, but at least they have journalistic [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2996.16s)]
*  standards. And, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=2998.16s)]
*  you know, look at Joe Rogan [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3000.16s)]
*  and Theo Vaughn. They didn't ask Donald [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3002.16s)]
*  Trump enough tough questions or stuff. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3004.16s)]
*  And [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3006.16s)]
*  while it is true that neither [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3008.16s)]
*  the Joe Rogan or Theo Vaughn interview [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3010.16s)]
*  of Donald Trump were like hard hitting [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3012.16s)]
*  confrontational [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3014.16s)]
*  grilling sessions, I've [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3016.16s)]
*  been saying for a while, it's [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3018.16s)]
*  still an enormous improvement [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3020.16s)]
*  over the corporate media [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3022.16s)]
*  having the monopoly on this stuff, because they also [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3024.16s)]
*  don't ask good questions. And at least [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3026.16s)]
*  now, at least with [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3028.16s)]
*  Theo Vaughn or something like that, you [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3030.16s)]
*  get to see Donald Trump. You get to [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3032.16s)]
*  learn a little something else about Donald Trump [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3034.16s)]
*  with Joe Rogan. You actually, I thought [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3036.16s)]
*  when Joe Rogan asked him about the [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3038.16s)]
*  2020 election, I thought it was the most powerful [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3040.16s)]
*  time he's ever been asked about that. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3042.16s)]
*  And part of that is because he was just having [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3044.16s)]
*  an open, friendly conversation. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3046.16s)]
*  And then when it came to it, he really just had nothing. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3048.16s)]
*  He had nothing to back it up. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3050.16s)]
*  And that was more exposed in a [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3052.16s)]
*  way than it would have been if some [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3054.16s)]
*  aggressive CNN anchor was asking [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3056.16s)]
*  him about it. And then he just dunks on [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3058.16s)]
*  CNN for being so terrible. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3060.16s)]
*  And then, you know what I mean? Like it was more [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3062.16s)]
*  powerful, I thought, coming from Joe. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3064.16s)]
*  Anyway, this, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3066.16s)]
*  I did think this moment [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3068.16s)]
*  was really good evidence [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3070.16s)]
*  that I'm right. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3072.16s)]
*  It's a weird way to preface it. But [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3074.16s)]
*  it is like you saw [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3076.16s)]
*  Andrew, who I give a lot of credit to, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3078.16s)]
*  do a better job [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3080.16s)]
*  just in this moment, just in this clip. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3082.16s)]
*  He did something that for all of the [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3084.16s)]
*  journalists who have been [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3086.16s)]
*  talking to Bernie Sanders over the last [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3088.16s)]
*  eight years, I've [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3090.16s)]
*  never seen anyone get as interesting [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3092.16s)]
*  an admission out of him. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3094.16s)]
*  So again, without further ado, let's play the clip [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3096.16s)]
*  and then me and you can discuss it, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3098.16s)]
*  Rob. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3100.16s)]
*  The problem I think a lot of voters had is [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3102.16s)]
*  like they didn't even know if it was her. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3104.16s)]
*  We didn't even know if Biden was president. We didn't even know [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3106.16s)]
*  if these were her talking points. And we [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3108.16s)]
*  felt that over the last four elections, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3110.16s)]
*  Democrats, we felt [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3112.16s)]
*  that we didn't have a say [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3114.16s)]
*  on who could be president. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3116.16s)]
*  We talk a lot about the [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3118.16s)]
*  Republicans being autocrats and oligarchs [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3120.16s)]
*  and taking over democracy. But from [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3122.16s)]
*  the Democrat perspective, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3124.16s)]
*  and I'm a lifelong Democrat, I felt [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3126.16s)]
*  like the Democratic Party completely [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3128.16s)]
*  removed the Democratic process from its [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3130.16s)]
*  constituents. And they, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3132.16s)]
*  I think they need to have some accountability of that. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3134.16s)]
*  No argument. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3136.16s)]
*  I don't mean for you, I wanted you [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3138.16s)]
*  to, like, 2016, I was like, this is [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3140.16s)]
*  going to happen. This guy's going to do it. And it felt [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3142.16s)]
*  like they, it felt like they stole it from me. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3144.16s)]
*  And I'll be honest, it broke my heart when [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3146.16s)]
*  you, when you supported them. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3148.16s)]
*  Look, but you have, in the world [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3150.16s)]
*  that I live in, you got a choice. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3152.16s)]
*  And [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3154.16s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people, including [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3156.16s)]
*  my wife, agree with you. But [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3158.16s)]
*  you know, you're down to a choice. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3160.16s)]
*  Is it going to be Hillary Clinton or is it going to be [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3162.16s)]
*  Donald Trump? Not a great choice. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3164.16s)]
*  But it ended up being him anyway. So why [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3166.16s)]
*  don't we burn it down? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3168.16s)]
*  Well, because it's [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3170.16s)]
*  easy to say, burning it down means that [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3172.16s)]
*  children are not going to have, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3174.16s)]
*  you know, food to eat, that the schools [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3176.16s)]
*  will deteriorate, people will not have health care. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3178.16s)]
*  And I, you know, I'm an elected official, I got to [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3180.16s)]
*  represent the people. That's fair. And I can't turn my [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3182.16s)]
*  back on. But then could we not also [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3184.16s)]
*  say, if, ostensibly, there hasn't [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3186.16s)]
*  been a fair primary for the Democrats since 2008, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3188.16s)]
*  are they not also a threat to democracy? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3190.16s)]
*  We often hear. Fair enough. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3192.16s)]
*  That is, that is, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3194.16s)]
*  yeah, I'm not going to argue with that point. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3196.16s)]
*  Holy moly. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3198.16s)]
*  Is that not a fascinating [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3200.16s)]
*  little moment right there? I mean, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3202.16s)]
*  you also see, this is [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3204.16s)]
*  one of the things [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3206.16s)]
*  about why I'm [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3208.16s)]
*  big on the collapse of [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3210.16s)]
*  the corporate media and the rise of podcasts. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3212.16s)]
*  Because, look, you could sit here and [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3214.16s)]
*  say, and you know, you [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3216.16s)]
*  like, fairly could [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3218.16s)]
*  sit here and say, look, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3220.16s)]
*  Akash and Andrew Schultz [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3222.16s)]
*  are not journalists. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3224.16s)]
*  They're not, you know what I'm saying? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3226.16s)]
*  Like, these aren't people who went to school [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3228.16s)]
*  for this. But at the same time, they're [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3230.16s)]
*  both, they're both [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3232.16s)]
*  particularly bright people. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3234.16s)]
*  And they're both honest. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3236.16s)]
*  And so sometimes that's all it [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3238.16s)]
*  takes to just ask the obvious honest [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3240.16s)]
*  question. And you could see actually [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3242.16s)]
*  here how, like, something really [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3244.16s)]
*  profound is revealed. And that's that [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3246.16s)]
*  Bernie Sanders has no response [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3248.16s)]
*  to this. Other than [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3250.16s)]
*  the most pathetic, like, well, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3252.16s)]
*  kids aren't going to eat. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3254.16s)]
*  Like, wait, what? Like, what are you even saying? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3256.16s)]
*  The first of, yes, you're [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3258.16s)]
*  right, we were forced into this false binary between [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3260.16s)]
*  Hillary and Donald Trump. But Trump [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3262.16s)]
*  won. Like, so [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3264.16s)]
*  kids still did eat, I [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3266.16s)]
*  think. But, you know, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3268.16s)]
*  like, he has to just admit [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3270.16s)]
*  this goes, oh, yeah, the Democrats are also [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3272.16s)]
*  a threat to democracy. Oh, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3274.16s)]
*  yes, they represent the oligarchy as much [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3276.16s)]
*  as you screaming about this oligarchy. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3278.16s)]
*  And then look, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3280.16s)]
*  to say that [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3282.16s)]
*  you got the election stolen [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3284.16s)]
*  from you and then turned around [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3286.16s)]
*  and shut up and supported that whole [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3288.16s)]
*  system. And then to go like, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3290.16s)]
*  well, the problem is that if I [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3292.16s)]
*  didn't, Donald Trump might [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3294.16s)]
*  have won. Donald Trump won [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3296.16s)]
*  twice. I mean, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3298.16s)]
*  look, I suppose there is [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3300.16s)]
*  an argument there, like [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3302.16s)]
*  on some Machiavellian level, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3304.16s)]
*  that you could say like, you [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3306.16s)]
*  know, let's just say that you [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3308.16s)]
*  have two candidates and one [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3310.16s)]
*  candidate is preferable to the other, as [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3312.16s)]
*  bad as one is, the other one's still a little [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3314.16s)]
*  bit worse. And the one who's a little bit better [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3316.16s)]
*  screwed you over. And you're like, I'm going to bite [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3318.16s)]
*  my tongue on that and support [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3320.16s)]
*  them just because I think it's a little bit worse to not [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3322.16s)]
*  get that person in. Like, all right, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3324.16s)]
*  you can say that. It's going to be [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3326.16s)]
*  pretty tough given some of the other things [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3328.16s)]
*  Bernie Sanders has said. But [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3330.16s)]
*  even if you're making that argument, once [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3332.16s)]
*  it didn't work, and [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3334.16s)]
*  the worst candidate in your view [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3336.16s)]
*  got in twice, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3338.16s)]
*  then you'd have to admit it's a mistake [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3340.16s)]
*  because you're making a purely utilitarian [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3342.16s)]
*  or not pure utilitarian. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3344.16s)]
*  You're making a purely [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3346.16s)]
*  consequentialist [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3348.16s)]
*  argument. And the consequence [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3350.16s)]
*  didn't even work out. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3352.16s)]
*  So at that point, you'd have to go, yeah, I probably [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3354.16s)]
*  you're right. I probably should have [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3356.16s)]
*  voted, you know, I probably should have told [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3358.16s)]
*  the truth and not supported Hillary Clinton. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3360.16s)]
*  And, you know, Schulze [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3362.16s)]
*  gives him a little bit [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3364.16s)]
*  of wiggle room in a sense [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3366.16s)]
*  when he says burn it all down [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3368.16s)]
*  because then Bernie Sanders can say, no, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3370.16s)]
*  listen, burning it all down. There's real people in that [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3372.16s)]
*  building. You can't burn the whole building down, which is like [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3374.16s)]
*  a reasonable response. But it's not [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3376.16s)]
*  the question isn't necessarily to [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3378.16s)]
*  burn it all down. It's [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3380.16s)]
*  more like, so tell the truth. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3382.16s)]
*  Tell the truth. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3384.16s)]
*  You've been sitting out here for [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3386.16s)]
*  years talking about how Donald Trump [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3388.16s)]
*  is a threat to democracy. And you've never thought [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3390.16s)]
*  to add in the fact that so is your party [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3392.16s)]
*  until someone, someone pushes [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3396.16s)]
*  you on it and you and your responses. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3398.16s)]
*  I can't argue with you. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3400.16s)]
*  I'm a corporate guy. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3402.16s)]
*  I get my marching orders and I get paid [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3404.16s)]
*  pretty good. So what are you going to do? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3406.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I just don't, you know, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3408.16s)]
*  but so Hillary, that's the person [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3410.16s)]
*  on the team. I got a supporter. So I [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3412.16s)]
*  get a pitch. I get a check. I'm on a book tour. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3414.16s)]
*  Now buy my book. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3416.16s)]
*  It just seems to me like, look, I'm not against I [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3418.16s)]
*  I've and I've said this for [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3420.16s)]
*  for many years. I never really [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3422.16s)]
*  voted for president too much, but I have [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3424.16s)]
*  said for many years, I don't think there's [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3426.16s)]
*  anything wrong with voting for the lesser of [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3428.16s)]
*  two evils. And of course, in this election, I [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3430.16s)]
*  did that. I'm not against [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3432.16s)]
*  the lesser of two evils argument. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3434.16s)]
*  Less evil is [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3436.16s)]
*  preferable to more evil. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3438.16s)]
*  And so there are appropriate times where [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3440.16s)]
*  supporting lesser evil makes [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3442.16s)]
*  sense. But when [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3444.16s)]
*  the basis for doing it [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3446.16s)]
*  is that one guy [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3448.16s)]
*  represents a threat to democracy. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3450.16s)]
*  And then when it's pointed out that both sides represent [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3452.16s)]
*  a threat to democracy, you have no [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3454.16s)]
*  argument that does seem [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3456.16s)]
*  to call your judgment into question [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3458.16s)]
*  here. I'm just here for a paycheck to [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3460.16s)]
*  might as well. But he said they're literally [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3462.16s)]
*  call them out. They're going to your whole yelling is about [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3464.16s)]
*  you know, about threats [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3466.16s)]
*  to democracy. You got cheated out of [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3468.16s)]
*  your process against Hillary Clinton. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3470.16s)]
*  Then we had Bozo in chief with [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3472.16s)]
*  prostate cancer. And he just [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3474.16s)]
*  steps aside for Kamala Harris [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3476.16s)]
*  to run. Where's the democracy here? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3478.16s)]
*  And the answer is there is [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3480.16s)]
*  none. But I'm not [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3482.16s)]
*  in the business of talking about that's [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3484.16s)]
*  the American people. That's not how [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3486.16s)]
*  I get my bills paid. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3488.16s)]
*  So, nope, that's not a cause [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3490.16s)]
*  I've been taking up. But I respect your criticism. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3492.16s)]
*  It's fair. And it [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3494.16s)]
*  is, you know, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3496.16s)]
*  it is, I think, powerful [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3498.16s)]
*  that Schultz can say [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3500.16s)]
*  like as a lifelong Democrat, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3502.16s)]
*  which I believe he was, you know, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3504.16s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure he's not lying about that. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3506.16s)]
*  But like he's Schultz was always, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3508.16s)]
*  I thought, like a pretty liberal guy. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3510.16s)]
*  And like many liberal [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3512.16s)]
*  guys, he [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3514.16s)]
*  eventually just saw through the bullshit [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3516.16s)]
*  and was like, oh, everything [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3518.16s)]
*  that the Democrats say is fucking lies. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3520.16s)]
*  And it's a big and it's a huge, huge [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3524.16s)]
*  story, especially [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3526.16s)]
*  it's a big part of why Donald Trump won [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3528.16s)]
*  the election. And it's [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3530.16s)]
*  a big part of why he's had more popular [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3532.16s)]
*  support in his second [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3534.16s)]
*  term than in his first. There's [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3536.16s)]
*  especially for [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3538.16s)]
*  someone like Bernie Sanders [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3540.16s)]
*  who tried [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3542.16s)]
*  to play the role of [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3544.16s)]
*  truth teller. And this is what he [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3546.16s)]
*  was seen as by a lot of his supporters. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3548.16s)]
*  It's just like it's incredibly [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3550.16s)]
*  weak, you know, particularly [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3552.16s)]
*  also when, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3554.16s)]
*  you know, he always [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3556.16s)]
*  Bernie Sanders always [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3558.16s)]
*  had much like I was saying with Cash Patel [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3560.16s)]
*  there talking about how they [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3562.16s)]
*  wanted to make sure there was enough [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3564.16s)]
*  police presence there and the other guys didn't. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3566.16s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but you're kind of like when you say that [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3568.16s)]
*  you're winking at something. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3570.16s)]
*  You're suggesting a bigger conspiracy [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3572.16s)]
*  like the suggestion there is not like, oh, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3574.16s)]
*  they were so incompetent that they didn't realize they'd need [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3576.16s)]
*  more police. Like if you [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3578.16s)]
*  just came out and said that, that'd be one thing. But [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3580.16s)]
*  what you're winking towards [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3582.16s)]
*  speculating is that they knew [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3584.16s)]
*  there'd be a problem and didn't want the police [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3586.16s)]
*  presence there because they needed the event to go off. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3588.16s)]
*  Right. I don't think I'm like adding [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3590.16s)]
*  too much into that. Well, likewise, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3592.16s)]
*  Bernie Sanders would always say [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3594.16s)]
*  he would stand up on stage when it was [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3596.16s)]
*  a one on one debate, a one on one [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3598.16s)]
*  debate between him and Hillary Clinton. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3600.16s)]
*  And he would say, I'm the only [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3602.16s)]
*  one on stage who hasn't taken money [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3604.16s)]
*  from the big banks. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3606.16s)]
*  He didn't even have the balls to like call her [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3608.16s)]
*  out. He would just say, I'm the only [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3610.16s)]
*  one when there's only one other person on stage. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3612.16s)]
*  It was the most ridiculous thing ever. And [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3614.16s)]
*  he would always say like, you [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3616.16s)]
*  know, these billionaires, they cut [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3618.16s)]
*  checks to politicians. You think they do that for free? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3620.16s)]
*  Or you think they do that [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3622.16s)]
*  because they expect something in return? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3624.16s)]
*  And you're like, OK, so then [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3626.16s)]
*  turn over to her and call her corrupt. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3628.16s)]
*  Because what do you, you know what I'm saying? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3630.16s)]
*  You can't say that and then not have the [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3632.16s)]
*  follow through to be like, you know, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3634.16s)]
*  like it's so weird, standing on stage with one other [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3636.16s)]
*  person and going, I'm the only one who [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3638.16s)]
*  hasn't taken money from the big banks and everyone [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3640.16s)]
*  who has is corrupt. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3642.16s)]
*  No, I have respect for Senator Clinton. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3644.16s)]
*  You know, like, wait, what? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3646.16s)]
*  Like follow the logic. And so if [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3648.16s)]
*  you're saying, as you're kind [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3650.16s)]
*  of seem to be, that she [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3652.16s)]
*  is anti-democratic, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3654.16s)]
*  that she is owned by [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3656.16s)]
*  the oligarchs, then you're going [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3658.16s)]
*  to have a tough time turning around and [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3660.16s)]
*  saying, yeah, but I could never say that. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3662.16s)]
*  I could never tell the truth about that public [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3664.16s)]
*  life. Just a tough position, a tough [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3666.16s)]
*  position to be in. All right. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_feG4eU-T6k&t=3668.16s)]
