*  What is up everybody welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem of course I'm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=0.0s)]

*  Texas porches that sounds fun where in Texas are you this weekend? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=21.64s)]
*  Oh I got Rockport Texas on Saturday I've got San Antonio on Friday and then Austin on Sunday [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  All stacked with some fine Austin comics gonna be a good time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  Hell yeah, hell yeah sounds good and the porch tour.com is the site as I've been led to believe [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=32.92s)]
*  And then like 10 piece out west and an upstate New York Canada run we're getting all over the place check it out [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=39.36s)]
*  Upstate New York beautiful country up there. That was just up there myself [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=44.92s)]
*  Okay, yeah, and also then in a couple weeks me and Rob will be out in Salt Lake City [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=50.18s)]
*  Back at the wise guys out there [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=55.72s)]
*  Which is a great club looking forward to that and then a bunch of bunch of road dates that will be on together for the rest of the year you can find a comic Dave Smith.com and as I mentioned the last episode I will say once again my weekend my at the mothership the ticket links are up it once again I did a better job of this last year than the year before but warning people if you want to come go get tickets now because these the shows at the mothership sell out quickly and I want it to be you know some of my people in there not just mothership people I [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=57.4s)]
*  So go grab tickets always a really really fun time really fun time that last last year my weekend at the mothership was and I've I've heard from a bunch of people who were there that it was the Saturday shows I guess but it was [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=87.56s)]
*  One of the one of my favorite nights of stand up comedy in my career which is there's been a lot of nights of stand up comedy it was the day that Trump got shot [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=106.48s)]
*  And it literally happened I mean I was about to walk over to the club from my hotel I was leaving I was like getting my stuff together leaving my hotel and my phone just started blowing up I just went on there and saw the video of Trump getting shot at mended shows right after that was crazy fun time fun night. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=118.8s)]
*  I was there for the Saturday early show and just there's a silent observer and that nice little VIP upper deck and then that's a comedy I've ever seen Mr. Smith. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=139.24s)]
*  Oh thank you well thank you it's fun you know there's moments sometimes like that that you just can't recreate but like there's a thing where you just go. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=148.84s)]
*  And I think I spent like I did like a half hour on like probably did like half of my headlining set on the thing but it's like we all just saw this thing it was so crazy like we're all kind of like okay let's unpack this together you know and so it was really it was a really fun. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=157.72s)]
*  Fun set so anyway I don't know how I'm going to top that this year but I'm going to have to I'm going to have to set up a very high level assassination for before my shows in August okay so. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=173.68s)]
*  Speaking of I don't know how speaking of high level assassinations the Kennedys are known for that and Bobby Kennedy is the secretary of the health department there's been some interesting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=186.4s)]
*  Movement over at the health department over the last couple days it's been you know I don't know so and maybe this is kind of like a broader you know topic which I don't know. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  You know we just we spend so much time over the years talking about it, but so Bobby Kennedy just came out and said that the health department is no longer recommending that healthy children get the coven vaccine which is good. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  It you know it's some of us might have been hoping for a little bit more out of this administration but hey that's that's a positive step in the right direction, but I have just because. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=225.0s)]
*  I guess partially because the I guess yesterday or the day before was the five year anniversary of George Floyd's death and certain and then also with the you know the health department doing a reversal of the health department. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=238.4s)]
*  On the vaccines it's just been I I've been thinking a lot about like those years and there's just there's been a lot of the like. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=255.04s)]
*  The compilations that are on Twitter of like what the media was saying at the time and it's so strange now five years later to look back at 2020 obviously the vaccines we're talking more about 2021 2022. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=264.72s)]
*  But it is wild like how much happened in the in half a decade you know in the last five years and so there is something as we're kind of climbing out of that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=278.52s)]
*  To to it just brings up a lot of these memories of how crazy everything went anyway. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=291.72s)]
*  Good good move by Bobby to stop recommending that kids get this thing it is one of those things though like when you just watch. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=302.16s)]
*  Even when government policy gets it right it lags so far behind like what are what are we even on what what what covid strain are we even on. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=311.52s)]
*  I don't even know what you call it like the last one I learned was omicron I have no idea what strain of covid this is it's certainly not the same one right rob. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=323.28s)]
*  It's gotta be a different one now I'm sure it's less deadly it's like that we you've gotten to a point where the thought of a kid having like a severe negative outcome from covid is like. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=332.12s)]
*  Statistically impossible I think kids get healthier from having covid at this point and like so now they're finally like oh yeah you know we're not recommended you take that vaccine anymore which by the way at the height of it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=344.76s)]
*  Almost no one was given this thing to their kid like even at the height of it when the overwhelming majority of adults had complied with with getting the jab some of us me and you rob remain purebloods. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=358.12s)]
*  But even at the height of it people weren't giving it to their kids and in large numbers now you're almost like what who who is even thinking about that but anyway they're not recommending it and that is good. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=372.92s)]
*  I thought covid just went back to being the flu that's that's what I thought I thought we were just done with it and you know at this point if any parent out there wanted to give their kid the booster shots and give them some every year and every six months. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=384.8s)]
*  Maybe they should just get the Darwin Awards for getting rid of their own offspring. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=398.44s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=402.48s)]
*  It is a very late abortions I am I am shocked that any doctor in the country was still recommending this I'd be surprised I'd love to know the numbers of how many parents were going into a doctor's clinic and recommending the latest covid booster. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=404.0s)]
*  This seems like no longer relevant information or policy that even needed to be made I'd love to hear the numbers it just seems shocking that this announcement needed to be happen. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  And if we're going to revisit covid let's be prosecuting Fauci I don't need these little tiny announcements about something that people shouldn't have been doing anyways I'm surprised was a law or a recommendation that was even still in the books. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=427.8s)]
*  Yeah it's well right yeah I mean look I couldn't agree with you more I mean I understand legal technicalities with the auto pen aside that Fauci does have a blanket pardon. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  So I you know I don't know what the you know how practical it is to to prosecute him at this point but I'd even be happy with just presenting the case. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=453.88s)]
*  Find him you know like even just for the hell of it and parade him in front of Congress and actually force him to answer all these questions and unwind some of what was going on behind the scenes that he pushed this as far as he did. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah you know it's um. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=475.8s)]
*  It's a tricky situation because there there is a bit of a balancing act and and part of the balancing act and and this is by the way one of the reasons why I don't like. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=478.48s)]
*  I don't like you know like racialism I don't like people I don't even like demonizing the left or the right which i'm sure i've been guilty of a time or two i'm not like trying to say i'm better than anybody else on this but I think there is you know. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=493.0s)]
*  We are we're all in a country together and even if you could imagine a scenario where the United States of America's government ceases to exist which is pretty out there at least today. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=513.0s)]
*  Let's just say hypothetically we the central federal government like was dissolved and we went to being 50 state governments which seems like pretty crazy like that seems pretty beyond the pale that the USA doesn't exist anymore. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=525.8s)]
*  Even so we'd still be neighboring countries like we're all still here and it's better if we can get along then not get along and I think it's unfair when entire groups of people get demonized. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=538.92s)]
*  I'm much more comfortable with demonizing the powerful as I think they deserve it but. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=551.4000000000001s)]
*  So like you know essentially what i'm saying is like in a way. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=557.32s)]
*  We have to move on from like the craziness of the last five years and of the last 15 years and things like. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=561.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm like over insanity has completely receded into the background now like nobody's really pushing it anymore I mean you still will see people like masked up at the airport you know I don't know maybe sometimes they have a cold or something like that I do get the impression that there still are. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=568.52s)]
*  That they have a stupid disability. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=587.4s)]
*  Yes right well there still are some percentage of people who are still living in that like paranoid state about germs. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  But it is such a small percentage it's less than 1% of the people you know me and Robert both very regularly at airports so we see this but like it's a very small percentage nobody is really like pushing any of this stuff anymore it's kind of like. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=598.12s)]
*  You know even more so than the woke ism woke ism has also receded tremendously and it's not being pushed the way it was but there is something where like. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=614.8399999999999s)]
*  Okay look we gotta move on we gotta find a way to be a society and move forward together but at the same time. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=624.5999999999999s)]
*  Sometimes there's something that's just too crazy that you're like yeah we can't just sweep that under the rug and pretend none of that happened. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=633.0799999999999s)]
*  That doesn't seem like a satisfactory answer either and I do as we've said many times on the show you know we are firm believers that the people at the top who committed heinous crimes. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=641.32s)]
*  Should be prosecuted they should there should be accountability for at least some people and I do think in a weird way that's what would allow. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=654.52s)]
*  The us to move forward in a healthy manner but we will see not holding not holding my breath on that so there was. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy gave an interview to that CNN lady. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=671.88s)]
*  Whose name I can't remember you know it's like you get to a point where she's like of the newer crop of corporate hacks. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=678.76s)]
*  And i'm just like i'm over i can't memorize anymore your names at this point I know the whole old school I know I know the older better generation of of hack journalists. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=688.44s)]
*  But anyway it's the the one who you know is did the the town hall with Donald Trump last year but so he gave an interview to her. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=699.72s)]
*  And there was this one portion which is going super viral and kind of touches on a similar subject to one that I found myself embroiled in. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=708.52s)]
*  And it was over the role of expertise and trusting the science. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=719.64s)]
*  I found this very interesting and then of course in this clip that we're about to play wolf blitzer he's from the older school of of corporate hacks whose names I know. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=725.0s)]
*  He was interviewing Lena when about this list so this is let's play the one it's a Tom Elliott's tweet great twitter follow by the way Tom Elliott go follow him. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=735.24s)]
*  This I found fascinating I wanted to get your thoughts on it as well Rob so let's play this clip listen to this. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=746.2800000000001s)]
*  Trusting the experts is not a feature of science it's not a feature of democracy it's a feature of religion and totalitarianism. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=754.5200000000001s)]
*  The what we should do is trust the science and we are going to do the science and the science is going to be wrecked or replicable and it's going to be gold standard people should not be taking medical advice. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=764.36s)]
*  I'm somebody who is not a physician but they should and they should also be skeptical about any medical advice they need to do their own research. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=776.76s)]
*  Dr when what do you think of that message. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=785.72s)]
*  Well I'm confused by that message and I bet that many people are confused about this too look I'm a clinician I talked to my colleagues for physicians and nurses all the time and yes we do our own research. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=789.0s)]
*  And yes, we look at scientific articles and we parse through them we look at recommendations. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=801.48s)]
*  But the thing is there are lots of different clinical topics it's not reasonable to expect that even clinicians and scientists look at the medical literature all the time. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=806.6800000000001s)]
*  And parse through the literature ourselves on every single topic, this is the reason why we looked at guidelines, there are medical organizations that synthesize these data. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=815.96s)]
*  And by the way, we look up to the CDC or at least throughout history we have looked up to the CDC to the FDA to compile these studies for us and to make recommendations. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=825.48s)]
*  And this we have always throughout history depended on our federal agencies as the gold standard for expertise for information for unbiased scientific data. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=834.84s)]
*  And so it's very confusing and quite distressing actually to hear the person who heads up these agencies to whom these agencies report now say that expertise cannot be trusted. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm confused because it leaves people wondering well what sources of information can I trust. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=857.6400000000001s)]
*  All right, so again I found this to be interesting because so in the longer version of the clip I mean Bobby Kennedy the CNN woman is like dumbfounded by this point that Bobby Kennedy is making. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=863.72s)]
*  And the point is essentially that like yes there's science and knowledge is not religion it's not an article of faith that a high priestess tells you what is true and then you trust that person. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=878.2s)]
*  You should try your best to be informed and make informed decisions and like educate yourself on say you know whatever the topic in this case vaccinating your children and things. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=892.36s)]
*  And it is funny that especially I mean I guess like the first thought is that it for all of the people who shouted so loud for so many years about threats to our democracy, including the current president. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=904.9200000000001s)]
*  Of the United States. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=922.2s)]
*  It's the most anti democratic worldview they have that this is a crazy thing she's confused Dr. when is confused that you would suggest that we shouldn't just trust the expert class and that we should encourage people to educate themselves. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=924.5200000000001s)]
*  It is such an obvious view and her this idea that you know we for years we looked up to the CDC I'm sorry who did who looked up to the CDC for you I'm sorry I just never knew this was a thing. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=943.64s)]
*  I'd never never once in my life heard a real person it have a real moment where they talked about how much they admired the CDC I mean I know during coven. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=962.84s)]
*  There were a lot of people who started having like a religious devotion to the CDC and believing everything they said and they got everything wrong. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=976.6800000000001s)]
*  Everything so like what the hell are we even talking about here is truly bizarre like I said obviously this very closely mirrors an argument that was launched at me a few weeks ago and. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=985.4799999999999s)]
*  Number one I think it's like it's the dumbest non argument imaginable number two you're like man you guys got to read the room because no one is buying this bullshit right now, especially in the wake of this this you know this catastrophe so I don't know any anything you want to add rub. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=999.08s)]
*  All right first I just have to say I really dislike that lady. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1017.8s)]
*  Now she's the second she starts talking on a personal level I dislike her. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1021.4s)]
*  I what's interesting to me here is the I think one of the reasons why people like democracy and they like the illusion of government. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1026.36s)]
*  Is that they like the idea that there's an adult in the room and that they're able to handle things and so they like the idea of oh there's going to be an expert class the expert class will be appointed by the government, they will go and do their research and so I don't have to think about or worry these things. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1036.1200000000001s)]
*  Because there's going to be an expert recommendation that came from this government system that's very good at doing it and I think what we just learned through cove it is they are not and they do not have your best interest in mind in fact they've probably been hijacked by corporations. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1051.24s)]
*  And they will use that power to rob you of your freedom or your wealth or to rule over you in whatever capacity they can and so we kind of have to as you said in your bait multiple times we got to embrace reality we got to see the world that we live in. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1064.92s)]
*  And so after the failures of cove it that's partly why Bobby Kennedy is now in that position is because people really don't like what happened over cove it he had the storyline more accurate than our government did it's now he's letting you know. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1078.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah we can't trust these institutions are kind of corrupt I'm here and I'm cleaning it up and in the meantime I'm not a doctor I can't make recommendations and there's a little bit of fun in that but we'll just go with it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1090.84s)]
*  I'm not a doctor I can't make recommendations you're going to have to do your homework people don't want to hear that because they don't want to be responsible for their own decisions. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1100.92s)]
*  It's a lot easier to live in a world where view where just one government expert tells you hey here's the food pyramid eat muffins muffins are good for you and then you go I'm going to eat muffins that's the government told me. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1107.24s)]
*  And if you're a doctor it's a lot easier not to really have to do your job and to just go hey there's no liability on me if I just take why do you even need to have a job then if you're just going to repeat the recommendation from the CDC. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1117.56s)]
*  Why can't I just go into like a chat GPT type thing for the CDC and go here what's the recommendation why do I need to see a health bed the why do I would have even pick a health expert if you're just going to repeat their gospel so I think. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1128.6000000000001s)]
*  The honesty of our of K here of a government is failing you and we cannot just rely on these recommendations I think undermines the entire pitch of government, which is hey you can just outsource and trust us to handle things. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1141.32s)]
*  Yeah no I get that's that's a good point and I think there is something that's a little bit more unsettling about the you know understand like you said grappling with that reality. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1154.2s)]
*  That there isn't this you know that there isn't this this class of experts who are trustworthy and who you can kind of outsource turn your brain off and outsource your thinking to them. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1165.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know how anybody still lives with that illusion you know it's like it's just been so obviously shattered. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1177.4s)]
*  But of course, then the you know which again I know about this a little bit too, but the there is this this intentional conflation. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1187.8s)]
*  That way, or you know it's like if you say that you shouldn't just trust the experts and that you should do your own research and you should educate yourself on a topic that does not mean that you're rejecting the concept of expertise. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1197.9199999999998s)]
*  That doesn't mean that you're saying that like oh there aren't legit experts out there like obviously there are but as Bobby Kennedy has made this point in other. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1214.12s)]
*  Areas and I always thought this was a really great example was that he goes you know, because he was an environmental lawyer for years and he goes every suit that I ever brought. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1222.8799999999999s)]
*  Like the prosecution had experts and the defense had experts and we called these expert you know we call them these expert testimonies and they would say that diametrically opposed things. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1232.0s)]
*  Because you could find experts who view things this way or you could find experts who have the complete opposite. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1244.16s)]
*  Opinion you know like still to this day this is true across every field across every single field in economics, you can find professional economists who will argue that raising the minimum wage will hurt. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1251.08s)]
*  What will lead to an increase in unemployment and then you can have others who will argue it won't and they're both experts they're both trained they've both studied they have exactly the opposite views and this is true across every single field. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1265.72s)]
*  Across every single field and so you know this kind of. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1280.6799999999998s)]
*  When when you live in a world where over the last you know however many years in recent history the expert class the expert foreign policy class has been pushing us into disastrous wars the experts in. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1284.44s)]
*  The economics have been pushing us toward devastating economic policies the experts in health have pushed us to devastating health policies and that a huge component to this kind of like expert. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1301.6399999999999s)]
*  To the makeup of the expert class is also who ends up getting into the positions of power in government and you know rob I've noticed this tendency. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1315.48s)]
*  That the experts whose expert opinion is that the government ought to have a lot more power. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1328.32s)]
*  End up being disproportionately represented in the official expert roles within government. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1336.0s)]
*  And like this is very obvious you can look at this across like nobody can actually argue that this isn't the case because it's just it's true across every sector and. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1344.84s)]
*  One of the things that's really amazing that that's been. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1356.8s)]
*  I think revealed on a mass level throughout the covid insanity is that there are so many people doctor when being one of the chief examples who. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1362.2s)]
*  Not only it's so bizarre because she has not only completely walked away from what she was saying just a few years ago she would never bring up what she was saying a few years ago and she won't even be in an environment where anyone will bring it up to her face and like push her on it like hey you literally said this. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1376.44s)]
*  And you got I mean she was out there rob if you remember we played it on the show years ago but she was the one out there saying that we can't give people their basic liberties back if they're not vaccinated because we need that as an incentive to make them get vaccinated. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1393.96s)]
*  She can't defend those comments anymore. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1411.4s)]
*  I'm so god damn monster for for holding these views publicly and yet so so simultaneously she's like hey completely forget about all that stuff completely forget about my track record. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1414.24s)]
*  And but I'm also still gonna lecture you about how we're the real experts and we're the ones you really have to trust I mean especially you know it's just so wild and look as I've as I've said many times before I'm not I you know I'm really not the expert when it comes to this health stuff. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1426.76s)]
*  And I'm you know I'm not claiming I'm an expert on on any of the stuff that I talk about because I'm not I'm not a real expert and there are but again there are experts who are diametrically opposed you know I just saw earlier today that Pierce is Pierce Morgan is hosting another debate between Benny Morris and Norman Finkelstein today. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1444.16s)]
*  These are two real experts like legit experts on the history of Israel Palestine they have completely diametrically opposed views you know and so what are you left with it's like I don't know I guess I'm gonna read both of their books and see who I think is more persuasive which is what I've done. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1465.12s)]
*  I've read books by both of them you know it's like and by the way I think Benny Morris's books were really really good 1948 was phenomenal really good book you know but like okay I think he gets it wrong ultimately in his conclusion or at least his conclusion today. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1483.44s)]
*  But anyway but just being a layman when it comes to the health stuff to listen to anyone sit there and go like okay first of all I've argued with my former family pediatrician who is arguing with me to get my six month old vaccinated for this thing. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1497.8s)]
*  I was clearly right and the doctor was clearly wrong also didn't know anything about it but even beyond that it's like dude the CDC the health establishment in this country gave us the fucking food pyramid. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1518.12s)]
*  This is what means I don't know if you remember Rob we're a few years separated in age I can't remember who's older or younger. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1535.0s)]
*  I stand by the old standards muffins are the most important and nutritious food you can consume and with bread it's what's at the top of the base of the pyramid. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1543.16s)]
*  Yes that's what you're supposed to this is what they told us I remember being told this in school like they had it on the blackboard like pulling it down on a rolly thing and showing us the food pyramid that's what they told us you know you're gonna want to live [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1551.0s)]
*  to the limit your your meat and vegetables but have a lot of white bread really cram in that white bread and listen I'm sorry but you you see this everywhere that when you like the hippie who was hanging out at like a farmers market was 100,000 times more correct than the expert class was when it came to health. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1564.96s)]
*  You know it's like I'm sorry we live in a disgustingly unhealthy society it is I mean I I'll tell you as somebody who travels the country a lot I cannot tell you how many obese children I say I'm talking seven eight year olds who are obese. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1590.96s)]
*  You go bottle sometimes. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1609.92s)]
*  You get the elbows it's like pushing an old lady in a wheelchair. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1611.92s)]
*  Yeah it is it's it's really disturbing when you see it so much but like there's I'm sorry like there to just like anybody who actually cares about health must be disgusted by this entire system. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1615.92s)]
*  There's just no way you could be defending it I'm sorry you walk into the supermarket and everything and even in like nice neighborhoods that you walk into the supermarket it is just dominated by like for aisles and aisles of of gushers you know what I mean just like just like poison absolute garbage that is that is killing our people. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1630.88s)]
*  If you if you turn on the television every other commercial is for a fucking pill that you're supposed to this is the expert classes view on health have a whole lot of white bread some candy and then take a pill to deal with that also you're going to want to take a pill to deal with how you're depressed from all of it too and it's like I'm sorry. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1652.84s)]
*  None of this is good health advice and then obviously you had the biggest you know if you are an expert in health care or in health in general you had the biggest test of your life. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1675.8s)]
*  I'm before you the you know once in a hundred year pandemic and you failed it on every single level you got absolutely everything wrong so how on earth do you turn around after that. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1690.1599999999999s)]
*  And and be like I'm in a position to tell you that we ought to be trusted and you can't do your own research and while it also is it is true like there is a point to what she's saying where she's like look like there there are. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1704.32s)]
*  There are technical questions in which you need a level of expertise to interpret data and to understand things. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1721.0s)]
*  While that is true it's simply not the case and people often use that. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1731.08s)]
*  To make a case that is not true and it simply is not true that the that a regular person of reasonable intelligence cannot read. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1737.4799999999998s)]
*  And gain perspective on things and, by the way, the way that us non experts do that typically is that we inform ourselves by reading experts. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1748.72s)]
*  Because, believe it or not, there are a lot of experts who also disagree with your official experts and some of them make very compelling arguments and so you read them and then you read your hack. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1761.52s)]
*  Experts try to counter those arguments and one of the things that ends up pushing a lot of people away from the regime official experts and toward some of these. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1773.96s)]
*  More dissident experts is that you guys tend to not have a response to the points that they're making and instead you immediately go to attacking the character of the people making the arguments and that is a tell. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1787.8s)]
*  But typically means it's because you can't take on the actual argument and that's part of the reason why you guys are losing this war very badly. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1803.36s)]
*  Alright guys let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show which is monetary metals a phenomenal company run by great people i've been telling you about them for a while if you own gold you've probably been happy to see their prices hitting all time highs over the last year. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1812.72s)]
*  But you might not be owning gold the right way if you're just collect if your gold is just collecting dust in your house or even worse if you're racking up storage fees to have your gold professionally stored consider a superior alternative and that is monetary metals with monetary metals. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1827.6s)]
*  You can own physical gold and silver it's stored on your behalf for free but better than that you actually earn interest on your gold and silver paid in additional ounces so now you're not just owning gold as a hedge against inflation but you can own gold and increase your total ounces over time. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1843.92s)]
*  This is an amazing company that is truly revolutionizing the precious metal space go check them out to learn more at monetary dash metals.com that's monetary dash metals.com alright let's get back into the show. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1861.92s)]
*  Any other thoughts on this stuff rub that's enough lean a win for one day hopefully we don't see I can't believe they still roll her out once again still a health expert. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1877.52s)]
*  Yeah it's really it's not even you know and it's not just there's there's a mix of two things and this is this is true with a lot of the people you know who exposed themselves during covid but it's not there's there's number one. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1885.92s)]
*  Number one there's there's the the stuff that they just got wrong like how much they just got the whole thing wrong I mean like not small things like really really major things and by the way nobody's done a better job of tearing this stuff to shreds than than Tom woods. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1900.88s)]
*  His book diary of psychosis was phenomenal also his like his online quizzes that he made with all the charts and graphs I mean it's all almost all of its in diary about psychosis but it just I mean he really demonstrated this stuff and by the way he's got degrees from Harvard and Columbia so I think. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1919.84s)]
*  He's allowed to have an opinion on this or maybe not I don't know does that qualify you as being expert enough. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1937.52s)]
*  But there's I mean literally like all of it didn't work. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1945.1200000000001s)]
*  This is like pretty clear at this point has been major studies done on this I know that one of the biggest ones was the john hopkins study that looked at all the lockdown areas first the not lockdown areas and could find almost no difference it had lockdowns or not locking down had almost zero effect on how much the virus spread. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1950.0s)]
*  Mask mandates didn't work school closures didn't work vaccine mandates didn't work like every policy that they pushed just didn't work so that's part of it it's like no you you lose the expert claim because you're wrong about everything what good is is expertise if you're wrong about everything. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1970.16s)]
*  But then the more disturbing thing is that it just exposed like what. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1989.6000000000001s)]
*  What tyrants these people were in their heart of hearts that like which has nothing to do with expertise you know it has nothing to do with with how well you know any subject it's there's a more fundamental like how you question of how you view liberty. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=1997.1200000000001s)]
*  And when you when you start saying you know when you're Arnold Schwarzenegger and if you remember his quote Rob where he said he said fuck your freedom. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2014.64s)]
*  So this was his message to the unvaccinated fuck your freedom is goat. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2024.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah right and you're like yo wait a minute this is somebody who held political power in the United States of America was a governor of one of our biggest states. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2028.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm that is why old that you you view freedom as this thing that can be taken away when at the whims of rulers that is like profoundly disturbing and we should never forget those people like those people who are in positions of power who became tyrants immediately. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2040.16s)]
*  It's almost surprising to me that at these news networks they don't have to pay. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2065.04s)]
*  The doctors better for two years and be like we need your help selling this storyline and that they pay them enough that they don't have to continue to work after that. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2069.2799999999997s)]
*  Because i'm shocked that they don't need new experts to come in and sell the next story i'm shocked that after you've gotten this many things this is so wrong and not just wrong. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2078.16s)]
*  But where you were pitching the country on stripping people of their freedoms the fact that you can still go on television and share your opinion without people just. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2087.9199999999996s)]
*  Protesting the offices of CNN in a peaceful manner and saying please put someone else on the air. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2098.56s)]
*  Is asking very nicely yeah yeah yeah no the fact that. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2106.0s)]
*  The fact that they don't. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2111.9199999999996s)]
*  We recognize that they have to kind of get rid of all of these people in order to rebuild any credibility is is kind of amazing i'm i'm not necessarily upset at it it's good in a way that they're this incapable of adjusting. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2113.44s)]
*  To the facts on the ground hey so okay let's let's switch gears a little bit because we should. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2129.64s)]
*  We should talk a little bit about the latest developments over with on on the fronts with both the proxy wars that were involved in as a none of them are particularly good. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2134.48s)]
*  But it's very interesting that it looks like there's been some good reporting on this I sent you the piece that Jeremy scale. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2148.56s)]
*  Had over at a drop site germy scale legit expert legit expert but he's he's a legitimately great a great journalist. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2156.08s)]
*  who's done some phenomenal work over the years his book dirty wars was was phenomenal and he's just been great on the foreign policy stuff in general, for the last 20 years or so. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2167.8s)]
*  He so he had a great piece about this axios had a piece about it as well, but evidently. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2178.88s)]
*  But evidently with cough and Hamas came to tentatively to an agreement that seems to have then been killed by Israel. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2186.4s)]
*  The agreement would have gotten 10 or the deal was that to return 10 living hostages in exchange for I believe it was a 60 day. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2198.92s)]
*  ceasefire and some humanitarian aid and things like that looks like the deal as Israel weighed in and killed the deal they said it was in effect a surrender to Hamas and all of this stuff and it's just it's like one more example. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2211.7200000000003s)]
*  Obviously, there have been too many to even list off here, but it is like yet again one more example of Israel being the impediment to any type of progress to any toward the prospects of peace. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2226.92s)]
*  It's one more example of Israel clearly not holding retrieving their hostages as their highest aim. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2241.52s)]
*  And it's just one more example of like why the US should not be allied with Israel is this is they're clearly taking steps that are not in our interest, but the other thing that I just couldn't as I was reading about this last night I just couldn't understand. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2252.12s)]
*  I just couldn't as I was reading about this last night I just couldn't help but find myself putting myself in this position but like can you imagine if that was like your family members. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2268.32s)]
*  Someone you loved who was one of the hostages and there's a deal on the table and it's agreed to in principle and then your own government is the one that's going to kill the deal that would have gotten these hostages returned. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2282.12s)]
*  I just can't you know I'd be ready to go peacefully protest and ask very politely for my government to take a different course of action if I were in that situation anyway just pretty pretty wild. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2294.72s)]
*  Yeah well you know it's always interesting when you actually see the coverage from Israel and they'll tell you storylines that will never see here and so you'll see publications in our it's actually trashing that's in Yahoo or you'll see other government officials saying that what's happening in Gaza is terrible and this is not a way Jewish nation is supposed to operate. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2306.32s)]
*  So my guess is although you might not hear that reported across our media my guess is that the sensibilities in Israel is that there's a large demographic that upon seeing this will have your exact reaction. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2326.92s)]
*  Oh yeah it's funny I remember when I was debating Laura Loomer about Israel about Israel Palatine shortly after October 7th I think it was I think it was late that year. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2338.72s)]
*  Late 23 maybe early 24 we were debating the topic and and I was talking about how Netanyahu was like propping up Hamas for years and she had never heard of this because she's an American Zionist so she's like what are you talking about and then she goes what's your source of that at what point and I was like the times of Israel [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2354.52s)]
*  in the Jerusalem Post like all the newspapers in Israel they're all this is like you know there's no there's no secret literally I said to her I got on October 8th the front page of the Times of Israel was Tal Schneider's piece that Netanyahu's support for Hamas blows up in his face or something like that was the title of the piece and it's like yeah no this is openly discussed in Israel they talk about this shit all the time it's widely debated and contested and all of this but in America it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2375.52s)]
*  you're you looked at like you're a conspiracy theorist or something like this ultimately the New York Times and the Washington Post did end up running big pieces on this buying quiet was the piece in the New York Times but this is when we debated it was before that piece had been written but it's like oh yeah no they talk about it over there I as I have maintained on top of everything else I mean obviously I've I am very convinced that what Israel's doing to the Palestinians is [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2405.52s)]
*  unspeakably evil. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2435.52s)]
*  The video that's going super viral of a little girl burning in a fire from this week there's been dozens of more kids have died just in the last few days over there's just absolutely horrible I'm also completely convinced that it's a it's. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2437.52s)]
*  Very clearly not in America's interest to be funding and arming and supplying Israel in this effort but I am more and more I'm just blown away by how how short sighted and how self destructive the Israelis are being and their their and their [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2455.36s)]
*  and how how short sighted and self destructive the loudest supporters of Israel are being it just seems like all around me I see and sometimes right in front of me I just see people like destroying their own reputation their own credibility there you know pushing people not only to the other side but like far to the other side. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2485.36s)]
*  I don't know if you you know I don't think we actually talked about this on the show but one of the one of the craziest things I've ever seen was the response to Theo did you see the clip on Theo's podcast. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2511.28s)]
*  He just had like a moment this is like a week ago or two weeks ago maybe but he just had a moment on his podcast. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2527.28s)]
*  First he's being Theo Vaughn first off he is the he's the most unhatable person in America. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2535.4s)]
*  It's like impossible to hate this guy he's just like a cool funny guy he's certainly never claiming to be like the guy who's read everything about this conflict he's had people who are pro Israel and people who are critical of Israel on his podcast and but anyway just had a moment where he was like he basically was just just saying I think he was like getting emotional as he was talking about it but he was like it's crazy man it's like we're living through a genocide in real time and this is the [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2541.4s)]
*  type of stuff you read about in history books and now it's like right here and we're all just like no matter how much we talk about it none of us can stop it it's just so horrible what's happening to all these little kids over there just like a moment like that and then you watch like the insane Zionists on on social media just trashing him. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2571.4s)]
*  It's like it's so crazy to me that anyone anyone's response to someone feeling bad that little children are being tortured to death and starve to death that anybody who's feeling who feels for those kids your response to them. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2589.52s)]
*  Is like you're a bad person because it don't you find this insane wouldn't at the very least wouldn't your response them have to be like I know I know and you're right to feel this way it is so horrible but here's all the reasons why we just absolutely have to do this as tragic as it is but they don't even attack it that way they just go like no you're a monster and like what do you think that does like do you not have enough can you not like. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2608.64s)]
*  Have enough of a moment where you could like take a look at yourself from outside yourself like you could transcend the argument you're having right now and go man this makes my side look really bad like if we if we have to demonize someone for having a heart. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2635.6s)]
*  Then probably that's not like a good long term strategy and likewise I'm just thinking about this as I'm reading about Israel killing yet another proposed ceasefire you're like do you guys not worry that this might look bad like does that not even enter your mind. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2652.56s)]
*  Is there no one at the highest levels of the Israeli government who's like hey guys we're now like 22 months into this thing we've completely destroyed Gaza we're openly planning the ethnic cleansing of the entire strip we spent two months allowing zero food to get into Gaza and we're bragging about it and now there's a proposal to have a ceasefire and return some of the hostages and we're killing it. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2671.52s)]
*  This might end up backfiring like this might be bad for us in the long term it is shocking to me shocking that there is not more awareness about this from the pro Israel side this is one thing and you know it's like a weird dynamic because you know it's like isn't it it's one of the I think the art of war. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2701.52s)]
*  Is like you don't get in the way when your enemy is is making a mistake you know so you're kind of like it in this weird tribal game where it's like I'm on this side and you're on this side it's like hey if the other side wants to make their side look really bad I'm not going to stop them from doing that but I must admit. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2723.48s)]
*  I'm truly baffled by it I'm truly baffled by like people going like whoa let's pump the brakes on this or or the lack of people going whoa let's pump the brakes on this this is clearly not working out well for us. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2740.44s)]
*  As we were talking about this I remember one of it was a man it must have been late October maybe November 2023 where we were doing a podcast and we were talking about exactly that like we were like hey read the room here Israel like this is going to be very bad for you if you go through with this. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2754.4s)]
*  This is almost two years later and and still not reading the room it's just wild to me. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2777.36s)]
*  Alright guys let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show which is American financing as we all know prices over the last few years have been drastically high and continue to be high and most people unfortunately have to reach for credit cards to cover bills but credit card debt has exploded in America and one of the bad things is that the credit card debt has exploded. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2783.32s)]
*  One of the bad aspects of that is that people are paying a very high interest rate on the money that they're borrowing but now thanks to American financing a family owned mortgage lender that's been around for 25 years there is an alternative. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2803.28s)]
*  Their mortgage consultants are salary based so there's no incentive for them to put you in a loan that doesn't make sense their customers save an average of $800 a month when they call and let American financing help them they don't charge any upfront or hidden fees to find out how much you can save and you may be able to close in as fast as 10 days. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2821.2400000000002s)]
*  You may be eligible to delay up to two mortgage payments creating more savings upfront they've helped hundreds of thousands of homeowners create meaningful savings and it's reflected in the reviews on Google give them a call today at 866-886-2026 that's 866-886-2026 or go to Americanfinancing.net slash Dave to learn more. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2842.2s)]
*  Again on average people just like you are saving $800 a month plus they may close your loan in as little to 10 days and you may be able to delay up to two mortgage payments giving you a cushion in these uncertain times give them a call today 866-886-2026 that's 866-886-2026 or visit them online at Americanfinancing.net slash Dave. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2867.16s)]
*  Alright let's get back into the show. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2892.12s)]
*  Anyway any thoughts on any of that Rob? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2894.12s)]
*  I just saw this story today is the guy who was negotiating this the guy who got the one American out or is it a different person? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2896.12s)]
*  Yes it's Steve Witkoff yeah. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2904.12s)]
*  Okay well I did think it was interesting that you know I guess the guy who might get the ceasefire is the one that the neocons were calling an anti-Semite. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2906.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2914.12s)]
*  I guess he's still working on the case. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2916.12s)]
*  I mean the fact that there's any progress in an offer on the table sounds like some improvement but it also just feels like the Israelis are looking for every excuse to not have to ramp down their operations. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2919.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2931.08s)]
*  Yeah no well I mean that was made pretty clear once again. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2933.08s)]
*  Alright the other thing that we should touch on a little bit is that Donald Trump is now at the threatening Putin stage of negotiations. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2940.04s)]
*  Also cutting deals at the same time he's doing both. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2948.04s)]
*  Yes that's right well this is Trump's negotiating style right. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2952.04s)]
*  So Donald Trump made some comments the other day about how you know Putin has lost his mind and I don't know what's happened to that guy. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2956.04s)]
*  Then today he said something about like you know Russia like he was like Vladimir Putin doesn't realize how bad it would be for Russia if I wasn't here. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2967.0s)]
*  You know there's like the kind of old Trump like oh I got all these war hawks around me and they'd be ready to go to war something like that. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2977.0s)]
*  Look like I don't really have too much to say about it. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2985.0s)]
*  I was certainly hopeful that it would have been easier for Trump and Vladimir Putin to come to a deal here and end the war. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=2991.96s)]
*  I think there have been several obstacles to that. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3001.96s)]
*  I think that you know I think a lot of lines were crossed and Vladimir Putin is aware of that. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3005.96s)]
*  He's also aware of the fact I believe and I've got this from some pretty good sources. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3016.92s)]
*  I think he's also aware of the fact that like there is the permanent government and that it's not like he can really just make a deal with Donald Trump. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3022.92s)]
*  You know like he can make a deal with Donald Trump but the next president could tear that up or the permanent government could simply just not abide by it. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3030.92s)]
*  But it does seem like one of the things that is very unfortunate in this situation is that I think Vladimir Putin [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3039.88s)]
*  a lot of the disincentives to continue the war have been removed from Vladimir Putin. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3053.88s)]
*  I think at this point he kind of views it as like look this is his shot. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3062.84s)]
*  He's got all the leverage right now. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3066.84s)]
*  There's no more you know it's like he knows that the appetite for supporting this war in the west has been greatly reduced. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3070.84s)]
*  He knows that even with more weapons shipments it's not really making any difference on the front lines. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3082.84s)]
*  He knows that the Ukrainian military has basically been depleted and now is his opportunity to carve up the portion of that country that he wishes to take [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3089.8s)]
*  and to decide whether he wants to push a little bit further and give himself a little bit more of a buffer zone which is what this whole thing was always all about. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3101.8s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3109.8s)]
*  I don't put too much stake in Donald Trump putting out this threatening tweet or whatever. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3112.76s)]
*  It's like this is kind of just the way Donald Trump always negotiates. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3116.76s)]
*  Hopefully we will see within the next month or two a major summit with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3120.76s)]
*  and they'll sign some type of peace deal and we'll see an end to the killing there. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3126.76s)]
*  I'm not sure if that is going to happen or not though. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3130.76s)]
*  Hopefully we see it. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3134.76s)]
*  Any thoughts on the latest? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3136.76s)]
*  It's too promising. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3139.7200000000003s)]
*  It seems like the minerals deal almost gives us an excuse for continuing to arm Ukraine. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3141.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know that we budgeted more funds to be sent over there but it just seems like it's the same circular nonsense. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3145.7200000000003s)]
*  Zelensky doesn't want to just say, hey, Putin can keep what he conquered. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3151.7200000000003s)]
*  He wants to say, no, we refuse to possibly accept that. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3157.7200000000003s)]
*  I think until Zelensky comes forward and goes, hey, this thing is over and lost, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3162.68s)]
*  Putin has no real incentive to quit punishing him. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3166.68s)]
*  Donald Trump has tried to interject a couple of times and go, hey, let's get this peace deal done. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3170.68s)]
*  I think the Russians know that stalling works pretty well against Donald Trump [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3174.68s)]
*  because he has ADD and he just kind of gets annoyed and moves on to other things. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3178.68s)]
*  I think they've learned that there's no reason to operate on Trump's timetables. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3182.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3189.64s)]
*  I said on the last episode it's hard to bet against Donald Trump because you never know when he just Michael Scots the operation [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3191.64s)]
*  like in that episode of Chili's and he just closes some big deal and you're like, all right, I guess this buffoon's great. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3197.64s)]
*  So everything about it seems like, well, it didn't end the war from day one. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3203.64s)]
*  The fact that he's getting up there now and going, this is a different guy, the old Putin, I would have got it done. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3207.64s)]
*  Seems like you're really walking back your position from I'll have this done by day one. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3213.64s)]
*  I think the last deal was foolish because it kind of gives them an excuse to go, no, we're getting something out of this. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3218.6s)]
*  And it kind of maybe gives Ukraine more hope or more resources, even though I don't know the specifics of money being sent over there at this time. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3222.6s)]
*  But it does seem like it gives a platform to kind of keep us supporting Ukraine, which allows them to remain in the war. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3230.6s)]
*  And anyways, this seems like the same thing I've been over the last couple of months. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3238.6s)]
*  It just seems like circular and that this thing's ongoing. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3242.6s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that, yeah, look, I agree with you. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3245.56s)]
*  And the minerals deal was a disaster. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3248.56s)]
*  And we said it from the beginning. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3250.56s)]
*  I mean, you can't look, you can't do that. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3252.56s)]
*  You can't you can't speak out of both sides of your mouth and sell it to the Ukrainians as essentially a security guarantee without the Russians hearing that too. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3255.56s)]
*  And going like, wait a minute. Well, what do you mean? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3267.56s)]
*  I think that was kind of almost the idea. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3269.56s)]
*  Potentially, I think the leverage play is instead of just going, hey, we're not supporting the war. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3272.52s)]
*  It's we will continue to support the war unless you want to actually make terms and come to a peace deal. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3278.52s)]
*  And then America going, at least we're getting something out of the security guarantee now and our willingness to continue to support them. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3284.52s)]
*  But that's we're going to start taking these minerals, which, by the way, I don't know if we're ever actually going to get any minerals because it's supposed to be like it's a complicated like 10 year joint plan. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3289.52s)]
*  We spent think it's reinvested over there. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3301.48s)]
*  And so it sounds like that's just basically payment for military gear. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3303.48s)]
*  And then Kyle Aslan pointed out on run your mouth. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3307.48s)]
*  I had him on for this. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3311.48s)]
*  And his prediction is basically that it's going to just be like a North Korea, South Korea situation will just be like forever militarized zone. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3312.48s)]
*  But he also said that the structure of the mineral deal allowed for massive scamming and that you could just basically come up with large quotes of what you think you will be able to deliver by way of minerals. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3320.44s)]
*  And so you get large cash payments up front from the United States of America on something that then never delivers. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3333.44s)]
*  And 10 years from now. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3338.44s)]
*  If you get the Warhawk administration next, they might not really care about the American first minerals actually coming to the United States of America. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3341.4s)]
*  So once again, just a creative way to kind of fund them in the near term while pretending that it's actually in America's interests. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3349.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's a look through the situation is a mess. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3355.4s)]
*  And this is again, none of this is is good. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3360.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, you know, Donald Trump, as is often the case with with this stuff, he just doesn't he doesn't have like a guiding set of principles or a theory that he's working off of. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3364.36s)]
*  And so he kind of jumps around to a lot of different ones. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3379.36s)]
*  And so he will flirt with some kind of like Buchanan esque ideas about like America first and being non interventionist and this stuff. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3384.32s)]
*  But then he'll jump over to like a big shiny deal. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3393.32s)]
*  That's always you know, because that's really who Trump is in his heart of hearts is like, let's build a great big building. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3396.32s)]
*  Let's make a great big deal. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3402.32s)]
*  Let's get, you know, a big, beautiful bill like we were talking about on the last episode. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3404.32s)]
*  And so he's like, while he would flirt at times with the idea of like, we should just get out, then he always flirts with, oh, but if we stay in, we could do this big, beautiful deal. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3409.28s)]
*  I mean, look, you see it in terms of what in Gaza, he's talking about like, oh, the real estate we could develop there in Gaza. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3418.28s)]
*  Like, he kind of can't help but be attracted to that. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3424.28s)]
*  But the fact is that we just need to get out of all of these different parts of the world. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3427.28s)]
*  Like we have our own problems here. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3434.2400000000002s)]
*  And the idea that the US government is I always love I think it was Harry Brown who first said this, but I might be wrong about that. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3437.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think it was Harry Brown who said, I'm talking about the war on drugs. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3446.2400000000002s)]
*  And he goes, he goes, the US federal government can't even keep drugs out of federal offices. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3452.2400000000002s)]
*  Which really is something to think about when you think about like a federal prison, you can't even keep drugs out of the most controlled, secure area. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3460.2s)]
*  And yet you're talking about how you're going to police the entire country. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3471.2s)]
*  Plus, you're going to have the D.A. going into South America and doing all this. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3475.2s)]
*  But like on the most basic bottom line, it's like, you know, you're going to have the D.A. going into the US. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3479.2s)]
*  And that's the most basic bottom line. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3487.16s)]
*  It's like Washington, D.C. can't even control the crime problem in Washington, D.C. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3490.16s)]
*  So what are we talking about with bringing democracy to the world or whatever or managing every conflict throughout the world? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3499.16s)]
*  It's just the idea that we can do this is ridiculous. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3508.16s)]
*  In so many of these examples, particularly in Ukraine and in Gaza, the US involvement has just it's made it's turned what may have been a conflict into a catastrophe. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3512.12s)]
*  And, you know, you can only do that for so long before you go, obviously, we got to get out of there. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3525.12s)]
*  And I think that's so much of this, too. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3533.08s)]
*  And I think this is really part of the minerals deal or part of the mentality that goes into even wanting to go down this path is just a basic like sunk cost fallacy that it's like, well, look, we put so much into this. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3535.08s)]
*  We can't walk away now without having anything to show. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3550.08s)]
*  But that's a basic economic fallacy. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3553.08s)]
*  That's just not an argument. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3555.08s)]
*  It's not an argument for continuing to dump bad money after good money after bad. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3557.08s)]
*  I think that's the biggest problem. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3563.04s)]
*  I think the biggest problem, Iraq, right. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3565.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3568.04s)]
*  Is that you can just walk away with nothing and have spent a lot of money. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3569.04s)]
*  American people will move on. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3572.04s)]
*  I remember when I was a by the way, the Knicks are playing tonight. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3574.04s)]
*  Big game for. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3578.04s)]
*  I remember when I was a kid, the Knicks had. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3579.04s)]
*  So they had this one great season in 1999 where we we were the eighth seed in the in the playoffs. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3584.04s)]
*  And then we went all the way to the finals, which I think it was the first time it had ever been done in NBA history. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3593.0s)]
*  But it was great. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3598.0s)]
*  It was a real fun playoff run. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3599.0s)]
*  Great, great fun team to watch. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3601.0s)]
*  And the Knicks after this season, their front office, they gave Alan Houston, it might have been two years after that, but they gave Alan Houston the like the biggest contract in the NBA. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3603.0s)]
*  They paid him like over a hundred million dollars. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3616.0s)]
*  Yeah, they gave him more than Kobe Bryant and Alan Iverson and like all the grand. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3618.96s)]
*  He just was not as good as those guys. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3621.96s)]
*  You know, like he was a good basketball player, but he was not as good as that. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3623.96s)]
*  And we totally overpaid him. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3626.96s)]
*  And then the whole team just fell apart. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3628.96s)]
*  It didn't do good. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3630.96s)]
*  But I remember for the next couple of years when you would see like it was a was Ernie Grunfeld. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3631.96s)]
*  I can't remember the guy's names, but the GM and the owner at the time and they'd all be defend. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3636.96s)]
*  They'd be like, no, Alan Houston is amazing. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3641.96s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3643.96s)]
*  He's as good as Kobe Bryant. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3644.96s)]
*  This guy's going to be like unbelievable. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3645.96s)]
*  And then the next thing you realize is that he's a player. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3648.92s)]
*  It wasn't like two years in the NBA. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3650.92s)]
*  He'd been playing in the NBA for like 10 years like we knew who he was as a player. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3651.92s)]
*  But they but you realized as you're watching them and I remember understanding the sunk [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3655.92s)]
*  cost fallacy back then as a kid that you realize that you're like, well, look, here's the thing, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3659.92s)]
*  right. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3664.92s)]
*  They can't admit that now. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3665.92s)]
*  Or your next thing would be well, we have to fire you then. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3667.92s)]
*  This is insane. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3671.92s)]
*  You gave someone this insane amount of money who wasn't worth it. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3672.92s)]
*  But you also understand where like actually the correct answer is to admit it. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3674.92s)]
*  It's not to say like, oh, well, we've spent so much that we got to keep going all in on [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3678.88s)]
*  this. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3681.88s)]
*  It's like, no, this was a poor decision. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3682.88s)]
*  You should reverse this decision. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3684.88s)]
*  You should admit that this was a bad decision and not continue to make it going forward [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3686.88s)]
*  in general in life. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3690.88s)]
*  That's very tricky for people to do. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3692.88s)]
*  It's very, very tough because what happens is you are psychologically you're incentivized [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3695.88s)]
*  to not admit how bad the whole thing's been. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3703.88s)]
*  I know I've mentioned this example before, but watching this documentary on abortion [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3707.84s)]
*  and it was like from a pro-choice perspective and they had this woman who was an abortionist [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3713.84s)]
*  and she's like an older lady. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3719.84s)]
*  She'd been an abortion doctor for like 30 years and she's sitting there and she's going [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3721.84s)]
*  like, look, there's no moral question when it comes to abortion. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3726.84s)]
*  It's not conscious. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3729.84s)]
*  It's a clump of cells, blah, blah, blah. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3730.84s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with having an abortion. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3732.84s)]
*  I remember just thinking to myself like, yeah, you better believe that. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3735.8s)]
*  You better really convince yourself of that because you, of course, can't even entertain [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3740.8s)]
*  the possibility that maybe there's a moral component to this because if you do, oh my [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3746.8s)]
*  God, like Jesus Christ, like all of a sudden you become a serial murderer of babies. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3752.8s)]
*  If that's so like, and by the way, I'm not like you can be pro-choice or pro-life. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3757.8s)]
*  I'm not even like saying, I'm just making the point that obviously if you're an abortion [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3761.76s)]
*  doctor and you've been performing abortions for many decades, you have to be all in on [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3765.76s)]
*  that side. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3773.76s)]
*  And so this is what happens. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3774.76s)]
*  It's like over time, once you've gone all in on a policy, it's just like people's feet [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3776.76s)]
*  get more firmly planted in their position and it's an unfortunate dynamic. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3782.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzg83T6l4oU&t=3787.76s)]
