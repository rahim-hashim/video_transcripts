# Dave Smith | Trump Flirts With Disaster | Part Of The Problem 1248
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI)
*  Hello. Hello. What's up everybody. Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm joined of course by Robbie the fire Bernstein. I'm Dave Smith. We are both in our respective [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=12.32s)]
*  homes what feels like for a very temporary period, but it is good to be back. We had [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=17.6s)]
*  a lot of fun up in Boston. You have a good time up there, Rob. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  We had a sold out show Saturday night packed weekend fans coming out slinging some of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=26.52s)]
*  these teas at a great time. It was, it was a, I always, I said it like before we went, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=30.6s)]
*  but Boston's just Boston's such a goddamn great comedy town. I love, and I love Boston's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=36.04s)]
*  a great city. Although I do, I know Rob, Rob, Rob drove up there and you were mentioning [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=40.12s)]
*  it's the worst city to drive through. And then I came home and I saw my father-in-law [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  and he was like, how was Boston? I was like, Oh, it was a great time. And he goes worst [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=51.1s)]
*  city to drive in in America. And he's a professional driver. So I was like, you know, Rob was just [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=54.08s)]
*  saying the same thing. So figure that out, Boston, make it easier to drive. Aside from [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=58.64s)]
*  that, no complaints. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=62.56s)]
*  And then we're, what do we got? Well, I'm, I'm getting on a plane to go do some traveling [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=65.14s)]
*  tomorrow, but the next comedy gigs are in Nashville. Then I know we got Chicago and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=69.64s)]
*  Rose. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=74.6s)]
*  You're solo in Nashville. Oh, are you not coming to Nashville? No, that's a year there [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=75.6s)]
*  with the festival and whatnot. But I'm going to be in a, where am I this weekend? I'm in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=81.52s)]
*  steamboat and then Des Moines and then us and then we're in wherever. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=84.72s)]
*  I think I did. I think I did know this at one point, but now it is, it is weird. I really [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=89.08s)]
*  am like, I'm like a special person to some degree where it's just like as a tit for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=93.72s)]
*  you, it's like Rob's not going to be there, but I'm like, then who will walk me to the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=98.7s)]
*  club? But who will be next to me? Who will pat my head if I have anxiety? Okay. I guess [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  I can do it on my own. I'm going to be 42. I guess I should be able to go somewhere by [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=107.6s)]
*  myself anyway. So a lot of stuff coming up, make sure what's your, your website again, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=112.52s)]
*  Rob Rob Bernstein, comedy.com Rob Bernstein, comedy.com. And of course comic dave Smith.com [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  for the rest of our, you know, for the year, we got a whole bunch of ticket links up there [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=123.16s)]
*  to see me and Rob, evidently not together in Nashville, but everywhere else we will [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  be together. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=132.32s)]
*  So let me just preface the beginning of the show by saying I did, I mentioned this on [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=133.32s)]
*  the, the members only podcast that we recorded this week. I did say at a certain point, I [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=140.16s)]
*  was like, I apologize. I'm going to have to repeat some of this stuff on Monday's episode [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=145.64s)]
*  because it's just like, I need to, I need to say this in front of the entire audience [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=152.32s)]
*  and not just those dedicated subscribers. But by the way, this is kind of part of the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=157.4s)]
*  cool thing about subscribing and getting the members only episode. Like you got to hear [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=161.44s)]
*  me as I was flushing out these ideas and I've thought a little bit more about them since [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  then. Also, there's been some other developments since we recorded our members only show. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=169.08s)]
*  By the way, if you want the members only shows, you got to go sign up at part of the problem [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=175.8s)]
*  dot com. Then you can also watch the shows live ad free uncensored. Only way to do that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=179.72s)]
*  is to sign up at part of the problem dot com. So then the latest is that yesterday Donald [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=185.68s)]
*  Trump, of course, because he, you know, he's Donald Trump, he threatened to bomb Iran. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  This was, I think in, in many ways, kind of the most serious sounding of his, of his constant [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=204.12s)]
*  need to flirt with yet another disastrous war in the Middle East. And coincidentally, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=214.32s)]
*  the only war that hasn't been checked off of the clean break foreign policy of the, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=223.28s)]
*  the, the, what has become the famous seven wars in five years that four star general [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=230.28s)]
*  Wesley Clark, the supreme leader of the NATO allies that he himself said that he saw the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=236.04s)]
*  plans for that we were going to have seven wars in five years. It obviously didn't happen [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=242.88s)]
*  in the five years, although we there's actually quite a bit of evidence that they thought [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=249.16s)]
*  they would get this war quite a while ago. But they of those seven countries, six of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=253.12s)]
*  the wars have happened. This is the seventh Iran happens to be the same. Now, of course, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  there is absolutely no political appetite for another catastrophic disastrous war in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=269.16s)]
*  the Middle East. Donald Trump won the presidency twice explicitly on distancing himself from [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=274.2s)]
*  that type of foreign policy. And yet Donald Trump continues to saber rattle toward this, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=283.2s)]
*  this policy, which would be again, as, as we both mentioned before, Rob, it would almost [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=290.76s)]
*  seem like, you know, with Donald Trump, just humiliating the Democrats and public opinion, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=295.92s)]
*  completely turning on the Democrats to the point that the brand of the party is, is toxic [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=304.08s)]
*  in a way like neither of the major two parties have ever been in my lifetime. And at that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=309.6s)]
*  moment, you go, okay, there's probably only one thing that could totally ruin this and usher back [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=315.36s)]
*  in the Democratic establishment. And that would be another catastrophic war in the Middle East. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  And so of course, that's what we've got to move closer and closer toward. It's really, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  it's astounding to say. Anyway, so Donald Trump, his I have his quote here. He said, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  speaking to NBC News in a phone interview yesterday, Donald Trump said, if they don't make a deal, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=338.88s)]
*  there will be bombing, it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is saying that they need now to make a nuclear deal. Or Donald Trump will bomb around [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=353.04s)]
*  like they've never seen before. This comes after, and I'm quoting here from Dave DeCamp's article [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  over at anti war.com, go follow anti war.com, go follow Dave DeCamp, they are the best. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=368.88s)]
*  Um, this is after, uh, the, the, uh, US intelligence agencies in their annual threat [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=374.4s)]
*  assessment, uh, said that there is no evidence that Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=382.4s)]
*  That there, it seems that the, uh, the 2003 ban, uh, that the Ayatollah put on weapons of mass [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  destruction is still in place. Of course, we've heard endless propaganda over the years about how [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=395.67999999999995s)]
*  Iran is on the verge of building a nuclear weapon. Um, and, uh, Benjamin Netanyahu was, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=402.56s)]
*  was decent enough to give us a timetable on when they were building that, that bomb. It's, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=409.12s)]
*  they should have it in five years, uh, from 1992, but also they should have it in five years from [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=415.12s)]
*  2003. And then also they should have it in five years from 2015. And then also they should have [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=422.4s)]
*  it in five years from 2018. My guess is there's still five years away, according to Benjamin [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=428.56s)]
*  Netanyahu, but we're really getting there. You were getting really close now to this war, to, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=435.84s)]
*  to fighting a war against a third world country that does not have nuclear weapons, does not have [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=440.32s)]
*  an air force capable of reaching the United States of America. In other words, poses zero threat to [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=446.08s)]
*  our country, but is an enemy of Israel in the region. And therefore we, I guess, got to flirt [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=453.28s)]
*  with this war. Um, I, you know, this is not just, uh, an isolated statement and I'm not, I'm really [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=462.4s)]
*  not doing the thing where people just flip out over Donald Trump saying something provocative. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=473.11999999999995s)]
*  This is much more than that. I mean, this is, he is already, um, continuing Joe Biden's policy [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=478.72s)]
*  of, of backing unconditionally Israel, it doing whatever they want to do to the Palestinian people, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  even when they're violating the ceasefire that the Trump administration pressured them to put in [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  place. We still have to back them. He's talking, he's, he's now openly, of course, put out the idea [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=496.88000000000005s)]
*  of ethnically cleansing, uh, Gaza on behalf of the Israelis. He has started bombing the Houthis [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=502.0s)]
*  for standing up to the Israelis. Um, and now even, even though on that, on that signal thread, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=509.12s)]
*  as was pointed out by his own people, this is completely in opposition to everything Donald [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=517.6s)]
*  Trump stood for. I mean, down to the detail of on Tim Poole's show, he said Joe Biden was an idiot [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=523.28s)]
*  for bombing Yemen for the exact same reason that he's bombing them. And they could say what they [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=528.72s)]
*  want on that signal chat about the way to sell this thing is to be like the Biden was weak and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=533.44s)]
*  we have to be strong. But the reality is that Biden was bombing the same group of people for [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=538.08s)]
*  the same reason. And Trump said it was stupid. Trump said, why are they always trying to bomb [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=542.4s)]
*  everything? Pick up a phone, do some diplomacy. Anyway, he's back in there now. So that's changed. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=547.12s)]
*  And you know, it's just, at a certain point, you do have to be honest about kind of the broader [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=554.56s)]
*  picture. I think there was, um, a lot of excitement about Donald Trump's, uh, presidency. I think that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  this is the way I said it on the members only show the other day. Right. And I, and I think I, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=569.3599999999999s)]
*  I pretty much still feel this way, but I basically said, if imagine you could pick like three baskets, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=574.88s)]
*  okay, for Donald Trump's second term, and in one basket, you would be like, uh, these are the good [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=581.28s)]
*  things that will get out of it. And in one basket, you'd be like, these are the bad things that will [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=587.1199999999999s)]
*  get out of it. And then in another basket, there were like the question marks. Maybe this could go [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=591.92s)]
*  good. Maybe this could, you know, and in we've gotten, I think we kind of knew, like, I think we, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=597.1199999999999s)]
*  I talked about this, the episode that I said I was going to support him. Uh, we knew what a lot [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=604.4s)]
*  of the bad things were. We knew he's terrible on Israel. He really doesn't get it on foreign policy. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=609.36s)]
*  He really, you know what I mean? Like is just awful on that stuff. Um, on the positive sides, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=614.32s)]
*  you were like, he's much better on Ukraine. He's much better, like a real improvement from the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=619.6s)]
*  Biden administration. And then of course, in the positives was that he dealt a just enormous blow [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=624.32s)]
*  to the corporate media. It, the way I said it was, I think in 2016, he destroyed the Republican [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=631.84s)]
*  establishment. And in 2024, he destroyed the Democratic establishment. He was a reset in a [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  lot of ways, um, in American politics or maybe not a reset, but like, uh, a massive, you know, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=646.64s)]
*  like if it was a snow globe, you just grabbed it and shook it up. Everything's different now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=653.44s)]
*  Um, it also would just culturally, I think there was something very important about the Trump [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=657.6s)]
*  victory, but then there were these basket baskets of question marks. And you know, as Donald Trump [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=662.08s)]
*  was actually putting cash Patel to head the FBI, at least attempting to put Matt Gates at the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=669.2s)]
*  justice department was putting Tulsi in charge of the intelligence community. There was this [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=675.44s)]
*  question mark that started to get raised. That was like, Hey, maybe, maybe the guy learned something [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=680.4s)]
*  and maybe, maybe because he's been so burned by this system, he's actually in a different [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=686.3199999999999s)]
*  mindset. Now, maybe he's actually like going to be doing some really good things that are better [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=693.36s)]
*  than what we could have hoped for. Um, I gotta say at this point, I think those question marks [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=702.0s)]
*  have been answered and all in the negative, just all, all bad, you know, like the, the, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=708.8s)]
*  you got a guy out here who is, uh, telling, he is telling his people to primary Thomas Massey [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=715.76s)]
*  and telling them to support Lindsey Graham. Tell me that. I mean, that just tells you the guy, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=723.76s)]
*  the man has learned nothing. He's learned fucking nothing. He is no better than he was the first [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=732.64s)]
*  time, you know? And like, obviously in some ways it'd be easier for me if he, if he had, but it's, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=738.8s)]
*  you just, I'm sorry. I can't, I can't bullshit about this. Like, come on, you're flirting with [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=746.64s)]
*  another war for, for Iran. You're completely unwilling to stand up to these Israelis on [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=752.72s)]
*  anything. You're, you're now even sabotaging your own legacy and your own administration [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=757.44s)]
*  just to do their bidding. What can you say about this? You know, as I mentioned, and, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  and for those of you who did watch the members only show, I won't be on the same rant for too [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=771.36s)]
*  much longer, but there's, you know, when you finally, you finally have, um, a real mandate [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=774.72s)]
*  from the people for mass deportations, it is now overwhelmingly popular with the American people [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=783.28s)]
*  to have mass deportation. That's how much Joe Biden overstepped. That's how much he fucked up [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=789.28s)]
*  that now it's actually popular to have mass deportations. And so what do you do? Well, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=793.6s)]
*  let's wait into the most controversial issue and deport people who are here legally for the crime [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=798.0s)]
*  of writing an op-ed against the Israeli government. Like what? Like, like if you wanted to sabotage [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=804.88s)]
*  the deportation process, I couldn't think of a better way to do that. Hey, okay. What do we got [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=811.36s)]
*  30 to 50 million illegals in the country? Let's send 200 to the most brutal jail in El Salvador [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=816.16s)]
*  with zero due process. What's that going to do lead to mass deportations or sabotage the public [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  interest in them, which by the way are not happening. There aren't mass deportations. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=828.24s)]
*  And I do look, I think, I think I'm trying to be fair to myself here. Um, but I also, but fair, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=833.44s)]
*  I don't want to go easy on myself here or be overly hard on myself here. Like [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=840.8s)]
*  I, I think I did lay this out as I was saying, I'm going to support Donald Trump. Like I was like, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=847.04s)]
*  look, he's going to disappoint. He's going to be bad on this. He's got, but at least we get some [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=853.3599999999999s)]
*  positives that we don't get if Kamala Harris wins. Um, but at the same time, I also did champion [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=857.28s)]
*  a lot of the people he picked and, and because they seemed better than the alternatives. I mean, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=864.4s)]
*  I just, I couldn't imagine, um, whoever else the director of national intelligence was going to be [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=870.24s)]
*  being better than Tulsi Gabbard. I couldn't imagine whoever the head of the FBI being, being better [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=876.4s)]
*  than cash Patel or whoever the health secretary being better than Bobby Kennedy. But at the same [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=880.4s)]
*  time, you know, you got Tulsi, um, King, you know, cheering on leveling in apartment building, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=885.44s)]
*  uh, literally as they're saying to him, Hey, we traced the guy, this guy, we traced missile guy [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=895.68s)]
*  back to his apartment building where his girlfriend lives. So we leveled the building and she's [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=900.3199999999999s)]
*  sending like thumbs up emojis, um, and saying job well done team. I got every time I hear from cash [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  Patel lately, it's never about the criminals in government anymore. This guy was on a goddamn [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=913.36s)]
*  media tour for two years. Everything he ever said was that all these, all these criminals in the FBI, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=918.3199999999999s)]
*  we got to get these people who committed all these heinous crimes against our Republic, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=923.28s)]
*  not talking about that anymore today. Now he's talking about bringing down drug dealers and sex [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=927.6s)]
*  traffickers. It's like, okay, but that's not what you were saying before. Then Bobby Kennedy is out [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=932.8s)]
*  fighting the real health crisis, which is antisemitism. So I'm just saying looking around [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=938.72s)]
*  the room, looking around the administration at this point, you know, I think we got the positives [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=945.04s)]
*  out of Donald Trump that we would get, but man, this all just points in such a bad direction. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=949.76s)]
*  And it's disappointing. It's just really disappointing. It's a, uh, I knew I would [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=954.96s)]
*  be disappointed, but it is the level of a Greek tragedy that these guys had this mandate and this [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=958.4s)]
*  opportunity and they're just fucking it all up. So anyway, just wanted to get that out on record, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=964.48s)]
*  uh, in front of the whole audience, because I think especially after, you know, throwing my [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=970.48s)]
*  support behind the guy, I do feel an obligation to do that. I will say my final caveat to this, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=974.56s)]
*  and then you can weigh in on whatever you'd like to Rob, but I will say that I saw, you know, one, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=981.52s)]
*  I saw one person today say on Twitter that, um, that they said that, uh, they said that, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=987.8399999999999s)]
*  well, there's some somebody who I respect very much. I posted a thing about, um, how some of [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=996.16s)]
*  the libertarians who have, uh, you know, supported Donald Trump have just become Trumpsters at this [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1000.8s)]
*  point and they'll defend them no matter what he does. And they were like, they'll probably [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1005.8399999999999s)]
*  cheer him on when he, if he launches a war in Iran. And then I saw one guy underneath that said, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  it goes, I know Dave Smith sure well. And okay. It's just like a comment on Twitter, but I was [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1013.3599999999999s)]
*  just like blown away and I'm not blown away by much, but I was like, does any, anybody actually [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1018.56s)]
*  thinks I would just because I'm like, well, I did support this guy. So I'll rationalize and, and like [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  defend getting in another war in the middle East is that, but just for anyone who may have that, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1028.96s)]
*  I will say this, if Donald Trump actually does launch a war in around, not only will I not [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1034.88s)]
*  support it, I, I will apologize for the rest of my life for voting for the guy that undoes any [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1043.68s)]
*  positive that might've come out of this. So just to be clear on that, it would be the most disastrous [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1051.04s)]
*  policy. And I just can't even believe, maybe like I didn't even mean it, but I can't believe [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1058.64s)]
*  anyone would think like, you know, that somehow we're, we are now in the business of just sucking [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1062.8000000000002s)]
*  up to Donald Trump. Fuck that. I was, I was as sharp as goddamn critic in his first four years. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1069.2800000000002s)]
*  It was a pretty sharp critic for the next four years after that. And then I supported him this [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1075.2s)]
*  time. Cause it just seemed like in the moment we had two options and one was clearly preferable, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1079.5200000000002s)]
*  but I have no loyalty toward Trump or anyone in his cabinet or, or anything about the [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1084.32s)]
*  administration. I'm, I have loyalty to my principles and my country and my family, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1090.48s)]
*  but none of that leads towards supporting a war in Iran. Okay. Go ahead, Rob, anything you want to [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1095.6799999999998s)]
*  weigh in on the topic of not cleaning up the deep state and all of the problems in government. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1101.6s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump was scorned by Netanyahu in that Netanyahu was the first one to, you know, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1110.56s)]
*  back that Joe Biden had won the election. And then even during the campaign process, you know, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1116.64s)]
*  he was inviting him to Mar-a-Lago. And then even when they attempted to assassinate Donald Trump, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1122.8799999999999s)]
*  he didn't really want to explore the storyline of who was trying to assassinate me. And he didn't [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1128.56s)]
*  want to, he wanted to thank the secret service. So it's, it's not completely surprising that they [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1134.24s)]
*  just seem to be moving on with status quo. I still have some hope for cleaning things up, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1142.0s)]
*  particularly RFK junior. I hope he doesn't use all the resources just to find out about this [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1147.28s)]
*  antisemitic health issue. And maybe he goes after, but the other thing that's just interesting to me [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  about the Iran situation is my read was he was trying to end the Russia-Ukraine war and perhaps [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1159.28s)]
*  get a pass from Putin to be a little bit more aggressive towards Iran. It's a little bit [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  surprising to me without that being wrapped up and also with Donald Trump saying that he's fuming with [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1172.48s)]
*  Putin at the moment, that now he's willing to ramp up the Iran pressure because that seems like a [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1178.08s)]
*  bigger problem than just isolated Iran. If, if he's duking with both Putin and then maybe goes [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1184.0s)]
*  back into Ukraine and says, we are going to support Ukraine. And then also starts going after Iran. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1192.64s)]
*  That sounds to me like a, a much larger war than just us bombing Iran. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1197.2s)]
*  Yeah. Which by the way is even in isolated Iran is a large project. I mean, again, this is not, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1202.48s)]
*  you know, and there's, there's military experts who understand this shit a lot better than me, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1209.76s)]
*  but it is not, it is not comparable to the war in Iraq. It's not comparable to any of the terror [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1213.12s)]
*  wars. Iran can touch thousands of our soldiers over there. We have military bases all throughout [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1218.3999999999999s)]
*  the region that they can hit. And the idea that we're just going to go in there and like bomb [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1224.1599999999999s)]
*  their nuclear sites, which again, they don't have nuclear weapons, but Bob, their nuclear energy [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1229.28s)]
*  sites or whatever. And they're not going to respond is just that not living in reality. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1234.2399999999998s)]
*  Well, who knows? Maybe that's just channeling Israel. Hey, go for it. Now's your window. We're [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1243.84s)]
*  not going to get mad at you. Yeah. Well, look, I mean, that's, that'd be pretty bad too, but I [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1247.84s)]
*  guess perhaps better than the alternative. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1254.0s)]

*  left, there's, there's a lot of people who oppose this stuff too, but forget that. I'm just talking [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1364.96s)]
*  about Donald Trump's base here. It's, it's, it's, it's interesting that it's like there [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1368.72s)]
*  is essentially no way to actually launch this war without completely dividing [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1375.6000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's base and that, you know, you can just read the room in terms of like, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1383.76s)]
*  not, not just social media, but like in terms of like high profile Trump supporters, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1388.0s)]
*  he will lose a ton, uh, over launching these wars. He's already lost support over just continuing [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1394.64s)]
*  to back Israel and bombing the Houthis. But if he really steps this up and starts bombing around, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1400.96s)]
*  I mean, I just, it's, it's going to be a political nightmare for him. So we will see what he chooses [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1405.52s)]
*  to do. I mean, there's obviously, you know, there, there are things that, um, particularly when it [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1412.24s)]
*  comes to foreign policy, it's true with government policy in general, but it, particularly when it [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1417.92s)]
*  comes to foreign policy, there are, we've watched a lot of wars get started when there is absolutely [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1421.52s)]
*  no popular support for them on the ground, you know, but it's just like, well, this is what [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1428.24s)]
*  some powerful people who really control our foreign policy want. And so that's what they're [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1433.2s)]
*  going to get. Um, all right. Anyway, uh, you know what, let's, uh, let's go. I thought this was, um, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1437.28s)]
*  this was quite entertaining to me, but let's, let's go to the, uh, um, the rabbi Senate testimony, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1445.52s)]
*  uh, which was, uh, anti anti-Semitism. This, this clip is going super viral. It kind of is on the [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1452.8s)]
*  theme of, uh, um, it's on the theme of what we were talking about with this big divide, uh, about, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1460.8s)]
*  you know, kind of the non-interventionist streak, the America first people who support [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1470.32s)]
*  Donald Trump and then the neo cons and the neo con like supporters of Donald Trump. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1475.44s)]
*  I will say, I must say that even I have seen this video is going super viral. Um, it also has a lot [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1480.96s)]
*  to do with the whole, uh, woke right debate that I've kind of publicly been in with a constant in [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1488.16s)]
*  Kisen and, uh, James, uh, Lindsay, although I haven't actually had a formal debate on the subject. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1493.28s)]
*  I don't know that anybody has, and I've offered many times, but anyway, whatever. But I've seen [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1499.1200000000001s)]
*  people like, uh, like I saw Will Chamberlain and I saw, um, um, Matt Walsh and like people who were [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1505.68s)]
*  like, I wouldn't have thought would have jumped on this, that, that were at least this, this was too [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1510.88s)]
*  far for even them. And they were like, yeah, now this is woke bullshit. Like we don't, this isn't [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1515.92s)]
*  how this is everything we've been against. Like it's always interesting to me and I, it, I find it [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1520.0s)]
*  endearing and I, I appreciate it in people, but where you just see, sometimes you just see people, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1525.3600000000001s)]
*  even when it's against their interest, go like, yeah, I, I'm not comfortable being this big of a [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1530.88s)]
*  hypocrite. You know, like just like, I, I'm not comfortable preaching against something every [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1536.4s)]
*  single day for 15 straight years and then embracing that exact thing the next day. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1542.4s)]
*  Like I'm not going to do that. And so I do appreciate those people who were saying that, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1548.0800000000002s)]
*  by the way, it should also be mentioned, um, that this was, uh, this, uh, witness, um, hold on, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1552.0800000000002s)]
*  sorry, one second. Let me, uh, because I saw, um, okay. So, so this witness was introduced by [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1560.48s)]
*  Republican Senator Bill Cassidy. Um, I'm getting this from, uh, Sagar and Jetti, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1568.48s)]
*  it's an excellent journalist. Um, make sure you go follow him and follow breaking points. Great show. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1574.0s)]
*  Um, who, uh, this is, this was, uh, this witness was introduced by Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1579.44s)]
*  who has openly decried critical race theory. So just to be clear, these, these are the anti woke [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1585.52s)]
*  Republicans who call on this rabbi to explain how, what we must do here. Let's play the clip. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1592.4s)]
*  Okay. Anti-Semitism is not just an age old prejudice. It is a contemporary crisis manifesting [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1598.48s)]
*  on campuses across the nation. It is not enough for individuals or institutions to merely claim [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1606.64s)]
*  they are not anti-Semitic. As my father once taught me, it is not enough for people, especially public [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1612.96s)]
*  figures to be neutral or not be anti-Semitic. One must be anti anti-Semitic. We must demand the same [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1619.04s)]
*  of our universities and government institutions. This hearing, in my opinion, is an attempt to be [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1626.08s)]
*  just that anti anti-Semitic anti-Semitism. All right. That was rabbi Joe Jorgensen, everybody, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1631.36s)]
*  bringing you the latest. We must, and I will give this rabbi the exact same response, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1641.4399999999998s)]
*  literally verbatim, the exact same response I gave to Joe Jorgensen when she said, it's not enough to [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1646.48s)]
*  be passively not racist. We must be actively anti-racist. I will say when this rabbi says [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1651.92s)]
*  it's not enough to be not anti-Semitic, we must be actively anti anti-Semitic. No, we fucking mustn't. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1657.76s)]
*  That's how freedom works. Actually, there is no must here. There is no we and there is no must. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1668.4s)]
*  I do not, people do not have to go out fighting against the, anybody having an impure thought in [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1674.5600000000002s)]
*  their heart or head. That is actually not the role of government. It's certainly not the role [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1680.88s)]
*  of religious leaders. It's not like this is just bullshit. And then of course, first of all, it is, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1685.44s)]
*  this is the identical creed to the woke left. Exactly, exactly the same thing that they say. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1692.72s)]
*  And of course, it's a tactic used in exactly the same manner because, okay, first of all, you might [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1700.5600000000002s)]
*  just go like, well, okay, we have to be actively anti-racist or actively anti anti-Semitic. It's [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1707.44s)]
*  like, oh, okay. So now, well, what exactly do we have to do to these people who have committed [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1714.4s)]
*  thought crimes? Like, what is it that we have to do? We have to assault them. Do we just have to [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1718.56s)]
*  ruin their lives? Do we have to get them fired? Should they be censored off the internet? Like, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1723.92s)]
*  what exactly do you mean by being against this thing? Oh, and then also who gets to define what [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1729.2s)]
*  the thing is? Who gets to define what racism is or what anti-Semitism is? Like, what is racism? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1734.4s)]
*  Is it racist if I point out that like we have a major problem with black crime in Chicago? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1742.0s)]
*  Is that racist? Okay. Is it racist to make an argument about disproportionate numbers? You know, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1747.0400000000002s)]
*  this is what the woke left rely on for all their claims of racism. Oh, there's a disparate outcome. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1755.2s)]
*  No, is it racist to point out that like the percentage of Jews in the population versus [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1761.68s)]
*  those in say the corporate media? Like, is that is like what exactly? Oh, you know, you don't ever [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1768.56s)]
*  have to define that. You just say we're going to go to war against that. Oh, and by the way, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1773.92s)]
*  every single American, every American, including the Jewish ones, I know from firsthand experience, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1780.24s)]
*  every American who opposes the foreign nation that is Israel's government is labeled anti-Semitic. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1787.2s)]
*  All of us, 100%. There is nobody who is a public figure in the United States of America who opposes [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1796.0s)]
*  Israel's action. Let's just say in Gaza, let's just leave it at that. There was just against [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1803.6000000000001s)]
*  this war who has not been called anti-Semitic. So what? Oh, okay. So now what are we doing here? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1809.68s)]
*  We're shutting down an argument by calling the other person a bigot and then implying that we [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1817.92s)]
*  must censor that bigotry. Who does that sound like? Who does that sound like? And it's amazing to me [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1825.1200000000001s)]
*  to see, you know, the guys like, like, you know, I haven't seen any of them comment. I saw James [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1834.72s)]
*  Lindsay retweeted somebody saying that like, no, this is totally different than the woke left. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1840.96s)]
*  Shit. It was just so ridiculous. But I saw Eric Weinstein like jumped in on agreeing with James [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1845.2s)]
*  Lindsay about the woke, right? Tell me one of them, Constantine, Eric Weinstein. Okay. James is gone. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1852.64s)]
*  He's that guy's lost his mind, but you two, you're looking at this. You don't see any parallels [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1858.48s)]
*  really. You don't see anything in there. That sounds a little bit like the identical argument [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1863.68s)]
*  that the woke left has been making for the last 15 years, that your, your opposition to a policy [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1868.8s)]
*  can be given the least charitable interpretation called just, just assuming that your motivations [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1876.5600000000002s)]
*  are bigotry and therefore we must be in a, in a war against you. It doesn't ring any bells [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1883.2s)]
*  because it's given me a lot of, a lot of deja vu over here. What do you think Rob? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1892.4s)]
*  I, I agree with everything you said. And this is a, this is compliance talk. This is, I'm going to [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1897.1200000000001s)]
*  lure it over you and you're going to be out because our agenda is so important that even if you're [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1902.72s)]
*  pointing out true information, if it gets in the way of our agenda, it needs to be censored. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1907.8400000000001s)]
*  This is the kind of stuff that they did with green energy and the existential crisis of global [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1912.3200000000002s)]
*  warming. And this is what they did through COVID would be the even better example because they [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1917.52s)]
*  stripped us of more of our rights and they censored us more on that particular topic. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1922.24s)]
*  Although it did happen with global warming, you get the little fact check on the bottom, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1926.08s)]
*  but that's what this allows for is that anything that you say, even if it's truthful information, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1930.48s)]
*  if we have a J an agenda of that, we have to be anti antisemitism. So then even if you're pointing [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1935.68s)]
*  out true information that doesn't help us eradicate the antisemitism or might lead to [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1941.36s)]
*  antisemitism such as criticizing Israel, which might lead to people also conflating Israel with [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1947.04s)]
*  the Jews. So then we can't have that. And so that, yeah, this is that nonsense compliance talk. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1953.52s)]
*  And it's, it's this fake, hi, you're either with me or you're against me. You're allowed to be [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1959.28s)]
*  neutral. You're allowed to have your own interests. We have this sometimes with, or at least I've [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1964.56s)]
*  confronted this sometimes where people, I really like telling jokes and I'm really interested in [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1969.92s)]
*  the fed. And sometimes people get really upset that you're not more passionate about the thing [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1975.44s)]
*  that they're passionate about. And it's like, well, I I'm not forced to use my time to pursue [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1978.88s)]
*  your agenda. If you have an agenda that you're really interested in sharing the narrative about, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1984.0s)]
*  go ahead and do it. But I'm out here and I'm trying to work on jokes. Cause that's what I love doing. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1988.0800000000002s)]
*  That's the value I think I bring to the marketplace. How much time should I give up from my passion [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1993.1200000000001s)]
*  to pursue this other thing that's less interesting to me. And that's what this kind of falls into is. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=1997.44s)]
*  I understand that it's in this rabbi's interest to protect the Jews from antisemitism as much [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2002.8s)]
*  as possible. And that's his passion, but to be standing up in front of the United States [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2007.8400000000001s)]
*  government and preaching some sort of a anti antisemitism, whatever. I mean, you're just forcing [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2011.68s)]
*  your thing on us. That's all this is compliance talk. No, that's, that's absolutely right. And, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2018.0800000000002s)]
*  and then like, and maybe this is like in addition to all of that stuff, but I just go like, I just [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2023.12s)]
*  feel like, why, why would, why would Jewish people want to do this? It's so short sighted. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2029.2s)]
*  It's, it's so like, you're sitting here and you're going to look, um, by the way, like I'm not denying [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2040.0s)]
*  that there has been a rise in anti-Semitic tweets on Twitter. And I don't know exactly. I mean, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2046.48s)]
*  you know, when you talk about like, like, obviously a lot of the protests as we've been talking about [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2054.56s)]
*  now for a year and a half, a lot of the protests against Israel, they are, they're, they're a [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2059.76s)]
*  different type of people than me and you, Rob. You know what I mean? These are not exactly like, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2066.16s)]
*  you know, libertarian gold bugs who are out protesting the war in, in Gaza. And they are, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2071.04s)]
*  I've certainly seen some slogans and chants and behavior, frankly, that I really don't like. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2078.48s)]
*  I also, you know, it's like, it's the same thing, like as, as the woke left though, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2087.76s)]
*  when they just start characterizing it as if like Jewish students in college campuses in, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2092.8s)]
*  in 2025, in a first world country at elite universities, you're looking for victims. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2099.28s)]
*  It's like, okay, fine. But like, you're going to have to really explain this to me, like really [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2106.5600000000004s)]
*  explain it to me so that it makes sense. Like you got to really have an argument for how exactly [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2112.48s)]
*  these people are oppressed. Like, look, I'll say, and this was never, you know, I, as far as like [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2116.88s)]
*  the trans issue was concerned, I was always, my biggest thing was always pushing it on children. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2122.48s)]
*  I thought was fucking insane. And like, just horrible. I thought there was on top of that [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2128.48s)]
*  kind of like a more interesting discussion about kind of the woke demands that other people [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2134.48s)]
*  recognize your, quite frankly, delusion that I thought was crazy. I never cared about the, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2140.88s)]
*  the female sports stuff, you know, like I'd agree. I'd be like, yeah, that's crazy. But like, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2149.76s)]
*  I don't know who gives like the fuck cares about women's sports. You know what I mean? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2155.6s)]
*  That was always my attitude. Sorry. I don't mean to be a dick, but honestly, and then that Riley [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2160.0s)]
*  games chick, when she told her story about how she's like, look, man, like we're on this like [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2165.68s)]
*  swimming team and there's like a dude with full dick and balls in our locker room. And we're all [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2171.28s)]
*  changing. We're forced to change in front of this guy. She's like, this really weird. And in a, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2177.44s)]
*  I'm like, I'm Christian and married and I don't want to do this. And you're like, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2182.48s)]
*  all right. Yeah. Okay. She's got a good point. Yeah. That's a fair, you know what I'm saying? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2185.76s)]
*  I'm like, if you know, but again, with the Riley Gaines story, right? The real issue wasn't just [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2190.08s)]
*  that a woman was being forced to change while a man watched her. The real issue was that that was [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2197.12s)]
*  backed up by the law that was backed up by the rules. If she went and complained about that, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2204.64s)]
*  she got reprimanded, not the guy. And in fact, you know, whatever. And so, so that's really the [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2211.04s)]
*  issue there. And likewise, if you talk about like back in the day with like, I don't know, like [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2218.64s)]
*  any type of like bigotry or like, you know, old school racism back in the day, the issue would be [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2224.72s)]
*  that like, Oh, and the system is actually protecting those people who are bigots. The system is bigoted [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2230.24s)]
*  themselves too. And so there, but in other words, like, if you were going to tell me that like, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2236.16s)]
*  on a college campus somewhere today, someone punched a Jewish kid in the face for being Jewish, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2241.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, you'd be like, Oh, okay, we'll call the cops. Now, if you then told me that like, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2247.04s)]
*  no, the cops come in and they go, yeah, screw that Jew, you know, punch him again, then, okay, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2251.2s)]
*  all right, now we got a thing where you could say there is like a systematic oppression of this group [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2255.3599999999997s)]
*  of people going on. But first of all, that's not what's happening. In fact, the system is working [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2261.44s)]
*  against the pro Palestinian activists. The Columbia, the epicenter of this whole thing [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2268.96s)]
*  has already like revoked the degrees of a bunch of people. We've seen deportations of people who [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2274.7200000000003s)]
*  were legal residents over this issue. None of and then you go like, look, all I know, and I don't [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2279.36s)]
*  know, I haven't been there. But like, they did host a Seder for the Jewish students last Passover [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2289.28s)]
*  at the Columbia encampment. So like, how anti Jewish is it really, you know, like, I'm not saying it's [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2296.32s)]
*  not at all, I'm saying I don't know. But if we're not talking about like a crime, if we're not [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2302.8s)]
*  talking about like, Jewish students being assaulted, or, or like harassed, and I mean, by the legal [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2307.36s)]
*  definition of harassment, not just like this woke version of they felt they didn't like what they [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2313.2000000000003s)]
*  were hearing, then what are we talking about? You're talking about the same shit the left woke [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2318.32s)]
*  was talking about? Like, what the Oh, students feel uncomfortable? Okay. That was the safe space [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2323.28s)]
*  argument. Like, oh, yeah, you're supposed to feel uncomfortable when you go to college. If you go [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2330.2400000000002s)]
*  to like, if you are actually, which I'm not a big believer that that many people should do. But if [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2336.2400000000002s)]
*  you're saying at 18 years old, you should spend a couple hundred thousand dollars and go away for [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2341.76s)]
*  another four years of school, because kindergarten through 12th grade has not been enough school, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2347.52s)]
*  and you're not ready to enter the real world yet. So you need four more years of school to just be [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2351.84s)]
*  lost in thoughts and learning and reading. Okay, if you're going to do that, and you're not confronting [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2356.4s)]
*  ideas that make you feel uncomfortable, that is an absolute waste. An absolute waste. You must confront [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2362.16s)]
*  ideas that make you extremely uncomfortable. If you're ever going to be even approaching something [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2369.44s)]
*  that could be considered educated. And so what are we talking about here? They're talking about [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2375.12s)]
*  a bunch of nonsense. Like the bottom line here, right? Is that this rabbi, right? It's your group, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2380.4s)]
*  and you want to do what's right for your group. And like, okay, but I'm just making the point that [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2386.88s)]
*  like, Jews are to also my group, Jews, we we are 2% of the population, we are extraordinarily [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2391.8399999999997s)]
*  successful in this country by any metric, doing quite a bit better than just white people in [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2400.4s)]
*  America are doing. Okay, this society has been extraordinarily hospitable and welcoming to Jewish [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2408.32s)]
*  people. There have been no obstacles in our way for success. And in fact, that we've achieved [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2416.2400000000002s)]
*  quite a bit of it. But there are some protests we don't like on college campuses, and some people [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2421.04s)]
*  say some things on Twitter we don't like. And so you're going to the United States Senate to [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2426.16s)]
*  lecture everybody about how we must be combating that. Honestly, you could look at that and not [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2431.44s)]
*  think that's going to engender more, more resentment. Really? Like, I'm just so shocked [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2438.08s)]
*  that anybody like if if your goal was to make Jews more accepted in the society, how anyone could [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2447.04s)]
*  think this was the way to do it? You know, it's like you were if you were like going over to like [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2453.84s)]
*  your friend's house, and they were having a party and you were like, I really want to win everybody [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2460.32s)]
*  over and make sure everyone here likes me at this party. So I'm going to start by complaining about [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2464.8s)]
*  everything about the party. I'm going to go up to everybody and complain about how they're doing [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2468.96s)]
*  everything. Our nerves aren't that good. We really should have more drinks here. We should like what [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2473.28s)]
*  this is just guaranteed to make more people hate you. Why would you approach it this way? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2477.36s)]
*  It's just it's and like the bottom line is this right? Because the truth is that whenever there's [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2482.5600000000004s)]
*  any policy, right? You could always find people who are bigoted who support or oppose that policy [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2489.6800000000003s)]
*  for bigoted reasons almost always, you know, if the if the policy is affirmative action, or DEI, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2499.1200000000003s)]
*  you could find proponents of it, who just hate white people. And you could find critics of it [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2508.4s)]
*  who just hate black people. You know what I mean? Like there are if you're a an anti black racist, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2514.32s)]
*  you're going to oppose affirmative action. And if you're an anti white racist, you're going to [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2521.0400000000004s)]
*  support affirmative action. But there's also lots of non bigots who support and oppose it. And so, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2525.44s)]
*  if you're if you're arguing for the policy of affirmative action, you can't just go Oh, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2532.72s)]
*  all the races oppose it. If you're arguing against it, you can't just go all the races are for it, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2540.32s)]
*  you got to actually take on the arguments that the people who aren't racist and support or oppose [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2546.0s)]
*  it are making. And the bottom line here is just simply this, because there's a there's so many, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2550.24s)]
*  people like ourselves included, but there's so many people who oppose what Israel's doing to Gaza, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2556.7200000000003s)]
*  who don't have anything against Jews. Some of us even really love the Jewish people, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2564.0s)]
*  and still can oppose this. And the bottom line is that this rabbi supports the war, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2568.48s)]
*  you support the war. And so you don't want protests against the war. And this is just like, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2574.2400000000002s)]
*  and this is the what really makes it woke, is that you support the war, you don't like the fact that [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2579.84s)]
*  there's critics of the war, but rather than even attempt to take on their arguments, you're just [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2585.76s)]
*  going to smear them all as bigots and say the problem we have here is a rise of bigotry. Isn't [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2590.0800000000004s)]
*  that weird, though, Rob, right? Like they're saying the problem we have here is anti semitism. And for [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2595.44s)]
*  some reason, it's spiked right after October 7. I had no clue what that could be. I don't know, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2600.0s)]
*  it's something something's been going on since then. That's really led to this crazy rise of [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2606.4s)]
*  people hating Jews. I don't know what it could be. I don't know. I sure there's been countless [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2611.44s)]
*  images of babies being pulled out under rubble. Maybe maybe that has something to do with this. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2617.68s)]
*  No, no, no, it's just an irrational bigotry, just an irrational. It's like, come on, man. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2626.08s)]
*  This is just so it's so transparently bullshit. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2630.48s)]

*  There's this clip that I saw and there was something that like Megyn Kelly had been talking [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2729.28s)]
*  about this recently. I watched her, she did an interview with a New York Times journalist [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2733.6800000000003s)]
*  and they were kind of talking about the kind of an interesting, like the idea. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2738.08s)]
*  It has to do with kind of like the idea of objective journalism, which is actually something [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2742.56s)]
*  was a theme of mine for many years that I always hated. I always hated the idea of objective [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2748.24s)]
*  journalism. And of course, when I say that, I don't mean I don't hate the idea of objective [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2754.24s)]
*  journalism. I hate the idea that anyone is ever doing objective journalism. Like, let me be a [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2758.4s)]
*  little bit more clear on that. I'm not saying a journalist could do a piece where they're like, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2767.36s)]
*  I'm trying to objectively cover this news, but I hate the person themselves being like, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2772.8s)]
*  I'm not a commentator. I'm an objective journalist because it does almost in a weird way, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2779.28s)]
*  elevate you above human status. You know what I mean? Like you're almost like, I have no feelings [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2786.1600000000003s)]
*  of my own. I have no opinions of my own. Well, okay. Obviously that's not true. You're not saying [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2792.96s)]
*  you don't have any opinions here. You're claiming that your opinions do not color your journalism [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2796.7200000000003s)]
*  at all, which is like a bullshit claim to make. Like, of course they do. And you must, if you're [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2802.48s)]
*  being the slightest bit humble, you have to admit that that's true. So anyway, so this woman who [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2807.36s)]
*  is the head of NPR, I think me and you watched one of these clips together, but she recently was [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2813.2s)]
*  at some congressional testimony and you know, the Republicans are talking a big game about cutting [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2818.88s)]
*  funding for NPR. This is something that PBS and NPR are always kind of had been in the Republican, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2824.32s)]
*  you know, in their talking points that, Hey, we should stop giving them money. Cause they're so [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2832.88s)]
*  goddamn progressive and they're public, you know, they're publicly funded or at least partially [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2837.28s)]
*  publicly funded. I, maybe this administration is more serious about doing it. That seems almost [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2842.88s)]
*  like the type of thing the Trump administration would do, you know? All right. Hey, we're gonna, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2849.28s)]
*  you know, we're going to defund, you know, the entire federal apparatus. It's like, all right. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2854.88s)]
*  Yeah, actually we're not going to do any of that, but we no more NPR money, you know, like that [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2860.2400000000002s)]
*  seems like the type of thing that might get done, but nonetheless, it's kind of an interesting [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2864.48s)]
*  conversation. So let's play this clip. And then I'm curious. Why, why should the Republican [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2868.32s)]
*  have to contend with the media apparatus that's sponsored by the government and undermines their [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2872.8s)]
*  agenda and just as propaganda for the other side, why have it 100% you're right. And first of all, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2877.44s)]
*  especially now today, like we are so past the point where there was even slightly an argument [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2885.76s)]
*  for why you would need a publicly funded news radio or whatever. I mean, first of all, like [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2894.5600000000004s)]
*  why can't, why can't you just do it on your own? Like just be, be a podcast or be a radio show or [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2902.56s)]
*  be whatever. But if you're telling me there's not enough of a market for it, we can't make it on our [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2909.36s)]
*  own. Like, okay, well it's the most oversaturated market in the goddamn country right now. So if [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2913.84s)]
*  you can't make it, there's plenty of other people, there's, there are plenty of left-wing podcasts [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2919.04s)]
*  and news shows and all of this. And there's plenty of right-wing podcasts and new shows. And there's [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2925.2000000000003s)]
*  plenty of centrist ones and there's socialist ones and libertarian ones. I mean, there's just [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2929.52s)]
*  everything. And, and so of course right away you'd be like, why should the government be funding one [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2933.44s)]
*  of them? And then particularly if you're in the government and don't share the ideological [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2938.24s)]
*  foundations of that, why should you be funding somebody whose ideological foundations are in [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2943.36s)]
*  opposition to yours? And then on top of that, we've also just, I think we are, we're just way past [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2948.16s)]
*  the point where you can even have these things in America because we're so divided culturally [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2955.68s)]
*  and we're so like, you know, just living in different realities right now that to have tax [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2961.52s)]
*  dollars funding either any side is going to be like seen as by a huge portion of the American [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2968.64s)]
*  people as like, oh, this is insane. You're funding like propaganda that is filled with lies. I mean, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2975.2s)]
*  like, I don't know, like, like, I think our side is right. You know, like I think we're correct on [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2982.16s)]
*  the issues, but I will tell you the story of the last five years is that our government was funding [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2987.8399999999997s)]
*  a virus in a Chinese lab with substandard regulatory safety procedures and then allowed the [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=2995.2s)]
*  virus to get out, knew that lied through it, conspired to lie through their teeth about it, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3004.3999999999996s)]
*  then locked the entire Western world down on the basis of pseudoscience, then lied through their [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3009.92s)]
*  teeth about that, then tried to demonize everybody who questioned the lockdowns of being these evil [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3015.44s)]
*  people while telling you it was racist to tell the truth that the virus came from this lab that our [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3020.8s)]
*  government was funding, then denied it, then lied under oath, talking about Fauci here, saying that [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3026.96s)]
*  they never did gain a function and that they didn't fund that lab when they clearly did. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3031.6800000000003s)]
*  Then they pivoted to a vaccine that they knew wouldn't do what they were selling it as. And [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3035.84s)]
*  that right. So I could tell you the whole story. NPR will have a completely NPR would think that's [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3040.8s)]
*  nuts. What I just told you. And they'll go, no, this is what happened instead. And now I think [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3046.48s)]
*  they're wrong. And I'm right. But like, we are just experiencing two different realities here. You [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3052.0s)]
*  know what I mean? And like, I don't mean that literally, obviously, there's only one reality. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3057.76s)]
*  And we're living in that and they're delusional. But I'm just saying it's too the gap is so wide [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3061.92s)]
*  that you just kind of can't have this anymore. Anyway, let's let's play this clip. Because I did [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3066.7200000000003s)]
*  I just found this to be kind of fascinating. So let's jump into it. Talking about NPR. I NPR is [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3073.52s)]
*  not biased in its coverage. You're talking about the national shows that the national [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3080.8s)]
*  news shows that we produce. I'm speaking about our editorial news gathering function, right? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3086.08s)]
*  There is not bias and NPR. I will say I was the other day on yesterday. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3090.96s)]
*  Puzzle already. This. Look, this is what I mean. But there's a real old school like journalist [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3096.0s)]
*  thing where this is how you're supposed to talk about your news coverage. I just thought I don't [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3103.28s)]
*  know. I don't know how we ever lived in a time where people would accept hearing this. Like, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3108.64s)]
*  what do you what does that mean to say your coverage is not bias? First of all, it's a joke. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3113.6s)]
*  NPR is as everybody knows, and I'm not like, I don't even hate NPR. I mean, I kind of do. But [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3122.4s)]
*  it's something that like, like if me and you were in a car ride together and you were like, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3129.2s)]
*  you want to throw on NPR for a minute, I'd be like, all right, let's hate listen to NPR for [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3133.28s)]
*  a fucking minute. You know what I mean? Like it's it's but to say that they're not biased, everybody [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3137.28s)]
*  including the people who like NPR, of course, know that it's bias. But well beyond that, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3143.2799999999997s)]
*  there is no such thing as non bias news coverage. It just doesn't exist. You always have biases [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3150.3199999999997s)]
*  in some area. And maybe you'd you could argue that my biases are correct. But there's always bias. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3159.8399999999997s)]
*  There's always nobody. If you think about it, it's like, it's like the type of thing where you go, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3169.2s)]
*  like you'd have to be so open minded that your brain falls out of your head. Like, what does [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3175.04s)]
*  that mean? If we if you were covering a story about slavery, do you do you cover that by by [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3179.52s)]
*  going like, now I'm not taking a position pro or against. I'm just telling you that there was this [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3187.2s)]
*  one group for slavery, and this one group against slavery, and I will treat them both equally. Like, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3192.8799999999997s)]
*  no, nobody does that. Everybody has looked there's even just when you say, when you have the entire [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3198.32s)]
*  media saying that Donald Trump represented the end of democracy. Okay, now, right away, the first [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3204.6400000000003s)]
*  thing that jumps out of you there is that that's kind of a hysterical claim. And there's no real [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3212.56s)]
*  evidence to suggest that and this is right. But forget that. In order to truly claim that you had [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3215.92s)]
*  no bias in your reporting, you would have to treat that as a completely debatable subject, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3222.8s)]
*  whether it's good or bad. Like, in other words, you don't say, and maybe the end of democracy [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3233.04s)]
*  would be a good thing. Because if you're pro democracy, that's a bias. No, you could argue [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3237.44s)]
*  that as a completely justifiable bias. But the idea of arguing that any to sit here with a straight [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3243.76s)]
*  face and say, our programming has no bias. What world are you living in? No programming, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3249.76s)]
*  no programming. There is never once in the history of the world, been a news program that didn't have [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3256.6400000000003s)]
*  a bias attached to it. It's that simple. Your bias might be that you're pro free speech, that you're [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3262.4s)]
*  pro democracy, that you're pro west, that you're pro America, that you're pro women, that you're [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3269.2000000000003s)]
*  pro LGBT. It might be that you're pro white people. It might be, you know, whatever it is, there's lots [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3273.5200000000004s)]
*  of different ones you could have, but there's always a bias. And so this, I think just eradicating [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3278.08s)]
*  this mentality, pretending is a positive thing. I think it's one of the best things about like the [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3283.2799999999997s)]
*  new media landscape is that nobody's really pretending that anymore. Nobody's like, there's [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3288.88s)]
*  no one out there who's really pretending, oh, this show is completely unbiased. Imagine Rob, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3293.52s)]
*  it's on the level of us saying that about this show. Imagine we were to say, we're completely [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3297.68s)]
*  unbiased on this show. Of course we have tons of biases on this show. We're pro market, we're pro [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3301.36s)]
*  peace, we're pro America, we're pro like there's the whole thing is biased. That doesn't mean I'm, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3307.44s)]
*  I still don't think we're telling the truth, but it does mean that like, oh yeah, no, we have a [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3312.88s)]
*  perspective here that we are giving you. Who would deny that and think anyone could believe them? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3316.96s)]
*  All right guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Moinkbox. I [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3323.52s)]
*  love this company. Did you know that four companies control over 80% of the US meat industry? By the [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3328.64s)]
*  way, that's the way it is in a lot of industries due to over-regulation. Usually about four [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3334.96s)]
*  companies control 80% of the market. But in the meat industry, these companies are using mobster [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3339.04s)]
*  like tactics to crush American family farms. And with the additives they're putting into our food, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3344.48s)]
*  Americans are stuck with sketchy meat. Now what you can do about this is you can check out Moink. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3350.0s)]
*  Their business is simple. Moink's meat comes from animals raised outdoors where a pig is free to be [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3355.84s)]
*  a pig. Their farmers are given an honest day's pay for an honest day's work and they deliver [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3361.52s)]
*  meat straight to your doorstep at prices you can actually afford. Born, raised and harvested right [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3366.08s)]
*  here in the United States of America. So support American family farms and join the Moink movement [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3372.56s)]
*  today at Moinkbox.com slash P O T P. Right now you will get free wings for life. This is the best [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3379.36s)]
*  offer they've ever given us. They're the best wings you will ever taste for free. But for a limited [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3388.16s)]
*  time only go check them out at M O I N K B O X dot com slash P O T P. That's Moinkbox.com slash P O T P. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3393.84s)]
*  All right, let's get back into the show. And in this case, such clear bias. If you turn to [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3404.24s)]
*  your liberal friend and said, Hey, I'm interested in learning more from a liberal, liberal perspective. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3414.16s)]
*  They'd say, well, are you listening to NPR? It's been around for a long time. It's literally one [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3419.7599999999998s)]
*  of the best outlets are if you're like, Hey, there's so much conservative radio and so much [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3423.7599999999998s)]
*  conservative podcasting. Where do I get more of like the liberal voices and more of the liberal [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3427.44s)]
*  arguments to understand these things? Well, have you checked out NPR? I mean, they've been around [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3431.92s)]
*  for 60 years doing great liberal coverage. It was, well, that's why I said it would be on the [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3436.0s)]
*  level of us claiming. We're not a libertarian podcast. You're just being like, no, there's no, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3442.24s)]
*  we're just being objective. And if that makes libertarianism look good, then it does. But like [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3447.6s)]
*  that's no, oh no, I'm not libertarian. We're every bit as socialist as we are libertarian, Rob. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3451.6s)]
*  Right? Like what are you talking about? And you don't have to pretend that in order to argue that [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3456.9599999999996s)]
*  like, no, I think I'm right about this. Right? All right. Anyway, let's keep playing. Sorry, go ahead. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3462.0s)]
*  Also, there were both PBS, a newswire, a news hour and NPR were better pre-Trump. And then when Trump [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3467.3599999999997s)]
*  won, the media landscape changed where the media companies that week magazine, there were a bunch [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3476.48s)]
*  of them that were, I'll just say better. And then they stopped reporting actual information and [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3482.3199999999997s)]
*  started reporting spin because they realized that they didn't have enough control over the narrative [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3488.0s)]
*  by just reporting actual information that that wasn't enough in terms of just kind of picking the [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3493.12s)]
*  topic and the lens. They had to actually report you spin and she'd be more instances of like what [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3499.12s)]
*  we saw with Rachel Maddow when in the middle of a Donald Trump speech, they don't give you the actual [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3504.08s)]
*  news because they don't want you to see the information and they have to spend it ahead of [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3509.2s)]
*  time. They let you see it. Yeah, they'll have to stop live. And here's the spin because actual [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3514.16s)]
*  information became dangerous for people to know. So particularly in the last decade, these people [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3520.24s)]
*  have engaged in doing intentionally biased media because they thought that their agenda was so [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3527.12s)]
*  important that they had to be biased. NPR is a definite example of that. I thought one of the [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3533.3599999999997s)]
*  things that was interesting about that congressional hearing was that they really brought the receipts [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3538.08s)]
*  over the way that NPR has covered these topics and Hunter Biden story might be one of the best [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3542.3199999999997s)]
*  examples. Yeah, well, that's coming up in a second. So let's get, but yes, you're absolutely [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3547.76s)]
*  right. No, it's 100%. And by the way, just to what you're saying, news hour on a PBS, I used to [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3552.4s)]
*  think like in the pre Trump days, I used to say, I'd be like, oh, that's probably the best like TV [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3560.2400000000002s)]
*  news show on the aside from like, you know, I loved Stossel and judging Napolitano and Kennedy, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3565.84s)]
*  but like I go, that's probably the best, like, you know, just, and it was always liberal, but just [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3570.7200000000003s)]
*  because it was like, it was like higher IQ, it was like, oh, they're actually like diving into a [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3574.8s)]
*  little bit of like, hey, what's going on in Somalia right now? Let's actually talk to some [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3580.1600000000003s)]
*  experts about that. And it wasn't just like, you know, whatever, like dumb cable news shows or [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3584.2400000000002s)]
*  something like that. Anyway, let's let's keep playing with this clip. Yesterday, it was like [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3589.44s)]
*  a long time ago. Yeah, I speaking with our editorial leadership today, they get one thing [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3595.92s)]
*  that came up quite frequently was the Hunter Biden laptop story. And our editorial leadership [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3600.32s)]
*  today says, you know, we wish we'd gotten on that earlier. And you in fact expressed a regret [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3604.72s)]
*  yesterday in the hearing. That was one of the newsworthy things you came out whole from that [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3608.7999999999997s)]
*  hearing. But what made news was your regret that you had not done a better job institutionally on [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3612.64s)]
*  the Hunter Biden story. Yeah. And to be clear, I'm not on the editorial side of the organization, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3618.56s)]
*  and I was not there at the time, but you represented it as your feeling and as the feeling of the [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3622.3199999999997s)]
*  editorial team today. That's correct. I think this is really important, not coming out with [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3626.48s)]
*  information soon enough is as good as not coming out with it at all. That story was relevant prior [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3633.2799999999997s)]
*  to the election. And then it got suppressed because it would have influenced the election. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3639.04s)]
*  Once that information, it's almost like if you had information about why I should sell a stock [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3643.2s)]
*  because the it's going to crash, and then you tell it to me after it crashes, that's no longer [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3647.04s)]
*  valuable information. The thing that I needed it in order to, or if you told me that there was [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3652.24s)]
*  poison in my water after I got poisoned by it, that doesn't help me. I needed to know that [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3657.12s)]
*  information before I consumed the water. So the news organizations love doing this, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3662.0s)]
*  but they correct the record once the information's irrelevant. And they do this a lot so that they [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3666.56s)]
*  could pretend like, oh, we just didn't do it soon enough. No, you suppress the information [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3670.96s)]
*  while it was relevant. And then once it became irrelevant, then you were content to actually [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3674.96s)]
*  share the story with us. That's suppression. That's what that is. 100%. And then look, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3680.64s)]
*  she does this kind of moving the goalpost thing a little bit subtly there. But when she says, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3686.56s)]
*  quite correctly, she goes, look, I'm not part of the editorial team. And I wasn't at NPR at the [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3692.4s)]
*  time. It's like, okay, fine, fair enough. But your claim was not that you are not bias. Your claim [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3697.36s)]
*  was that the programming at NPR was not bias. And so, okay, fine. You weren't there, but we're talking [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3703.92s)]
*  about them. That's who we're talking about, the organization that you now run. And so to actually [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3709.84s)]
*  with a straight face be like, hey, and we regret not reporting on the Hunter Biden story, to your [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3715.84s)]
*  point, when it mattered at all. It only matters now to point out how biased these guys are. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3721.68s)]
*  Okay, but why didn't you guys report on that? I mean, come on, you're really going to argue that [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3729.9199999999996s)]
*  that wasn't because of a preexisting bias that you guys already had? Like, do you think if there was [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3735.2799999999997s)]
*  a scandal about Donald Trump in October of 2020, they would have buried that story and only be [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3741.52s)]
*  talking about it now five years later? I don't think so. Okay. Like, it's like, oh, it's very [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3748.16s)]
*  coincidental. It's very coincidental that all your regrets happen to go in one direction, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3754.3199999999997s)]
*  and one direction only. And that happens to be in the direction that coincides with your obvious [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3758.72s)]
*  bias that you're denying. And get out of here. Now let's just play the very end of it and then [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3763.04s)]
*  we'll wrap up. We didn't get on it early enough. And so is that a mistake? Sure. We can acknowledge [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3767.7599999999998s)]
*  that we are not always perfect. My belief is that it's not our goal to be trusted. It's our [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3774.4s)]
*  goal to be trustworthy, which means we get up every single day and we try to do the best job so that [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3777.84s)]
*  we earn the worth, that we are worth people's trust, but we never assume that we're trusted. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3781.92s)]
*  They assume, speaking of assuming, they assume that you didn't cover that story more fully because [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3786.64s)]
*  you're biased. I do understand that. And that's why I think it's important to acknowledge when we're [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3791.44s)]
*  not. But you don't think that was biased? I was not there. And I cannot speak to the conversations [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3795.36s)]
*  that happen. So I don't know what went into it. But my view is that when we hear criticism, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3800.08s)]
*  we need to take it on board and we need to examine what it is that is generating this criticism [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3804.88s)]
*  and determine what we're going to do about it. If we are going to serve the public interest, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3809.6s)]
*  we need to hear from the public. And then we need to determine what of that is something that we can [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3812.96s)]
*  integrate in order to earn that public trust. By the way, that's it. The end of this. But you [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3818.56s)]
*  know what's a really great way to turn to the public is to not take government money. Just saying. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3824.24s)]
*  That way you could really find out what the market thinks of your news. But look for her thing here [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3829.52s)]
*  to be. And you notice at the end there, by the way, she really slivers away from the central [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3835.36s)]
*  argument because then he just has the obvious follow-up question. And this is not exactly a [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3840.88s)]
*  hostile interview, but the obvious follow-up question is like, okay, but people are going to [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3844.88s)]
*  say you didn't report on the Hunter Biden thing because of your bias. And then she goes, well, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3848.56s)]
*  look, I wasn't there and I don't know the conversation. So I can't say for sure. It's [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3852.4s)]
*  like, but you started out saying for sure you started out claiming very authoritatively [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3856.48s)]
*  that NPR is not bias. And here's a great indication that they are. But again, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3862.32s)]
*  she's still slithering away from the point here because it doesn't even, okay. You don't know [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3868.88s)]
*  the conversations. Yeah. I guess it's true. If you knew all the conversations, you could know [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3872.72s)]
*  definitively that there was bias if they were saying something by, but nobody, people don't [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3876.64s)]
*  have to communicate. Look, me and you, Rob, this show very, for anyone who watches the show, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3882.96s)]
*  as you should have figured out already, we are very biased. Now me and Rob have the same bias. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3887.92s)]
*  We don't have to have a conversation about that before the show. We, there doesn't have to be [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3894.56s)]
*  either me or you like sitting down and going, Hey dude, we're going to try to make the government [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3899.68s)]
*  look bad and make the market look good on this show today. Because that is already where both of [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3905.52s)]
*  us are, ideologically or theoretically. That's where we already are. We don't believe in big [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3912.4s)]
*  government and we do believe in laissez faire free markets. So that's going to happen in our coverage. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3920.32s)]
*  Whether me or you communicate about that specifically is irrelevant. And so if you [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3925.52s)]
*  have a bunch of liberals around who all hate Donald Trump, they don't have to be having a [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3930.48s)]
*  conversation about how we are liberals who don't like Donald Trump. It doesn't matter whether [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3936.08s)]
*  they're communicating that with each other or not. That's going to be reflected in the news [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3941.12s)]
*  coverage. And of course it is. Like who's going to deny it? MSNBC, you've got a whole bunch of [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3945.2799999999997s)]
*  progressives and at Fox News, you've got a whole bunch of conservatives. And so obviously their [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3951.6s)]
*  coverage of the day's news is going to reflect that. And this old school model, this is in large [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3955.8399999999997s)]
*  essence, this is why the corporate media is dead. It's also why people have such contempt for the [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3963.04s)]
*  corporate media. It's exactly why, by the way, even though MSNBC was more progressive than CNN, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3970.56s)]
*  Trump supporters always hated CNN the most. It was fuck CNN chants at Trump rallies, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3982.4s)]
*  not fuck MSNBC. I mean, I'm not saying one of those couldn't have broken out, but they always [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3989.12s)]
*  hated CNN more. And this is why, because at least with MSNBC, there was a feeling like they admit [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=3992.88s)]
*  that they're the antidote to Fox News. They admit that they're the progressive news, but CNN [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=4000.16s)]
*  pretends that we just play it right down the middle. And that's what's infuriating. Because [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=4005.12s)]
*  the real problem with it is that the whole game of journalism is telling the truth. The whole game [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=4010.72s)]
*  is being honest. And how do you do that when your whole self-identity is predicated on a lie, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=4017.2799999999997s)]
*  on a blatant lie, which is that I am not bias. I am, no, you know, who's bias, every goddamn human [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=4024.96s)]
*  being, every human being is bias, including these hacks. So anyway, that's my last Rob, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=4033.6000000000004s)]
*  you could have the last word and then we got to wrap up. Nah, let's wrap. I think we covered it. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=4039.44s)]
*  All right. Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Natalie. Thank you everybody listening. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP53vxddOI&t=4043.6000000000004s)]
