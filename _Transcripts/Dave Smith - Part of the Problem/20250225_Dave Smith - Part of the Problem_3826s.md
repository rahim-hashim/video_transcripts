# Dave Smith | Joy Reid is Fired | Part Of The Problem 1235
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo)
*  Hello, hello, what's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith and that lovely cupcake to my left is Robbie the Fire Bernstein. How [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  are you sir? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=17.48s)]
*  I'm doing well. How are you Mr. Smith? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=18.48s)]
*  Very good, very good. I cannot complain. I mean I always can, but I'm not going to. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Can I register a complaint? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=25.16s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=26.68s)]
*  My apartment's not clean, my studio's not clean, and I don't own this desk and it's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=27.68s)]
*  not my desk, but I'm still annoyed by all the shit on it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=31.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, this is a, I think of the studio as a shared space. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=34.36s)]
*  I'll bring it up with HR. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=40.4s)]
*  That's right. I think none of it is my responsibility. And if I'm being honest, I'm a little annoyed [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=43.36s)]
*  with you two that this place is such a mess. Why is it? Why are there wires everywhere? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=48.08s)]
*  I really am. It's unbelievable because it's so, I was always a slob and I really do, my [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=53.44s)]
*  wife makes fun of me for this, but I really do have this feeling like I used to be a slob [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=61.48s)]
*  and I'm not a slob anymore. And then I realized that I just married my wife. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=65.36s)]
*  And she walks behind you with the, yes at all. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=71.88s)]
*  This is the only room of this gigantic house that I'm responsible for and it's a goddamn [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=74.2s)]
*  mess. And then I go, every other room is really nice. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=78.96s)]
*  It's not atrocious. It's just the pile of books. It's all good, but they're nice books. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=81.96s)]
*  They're great. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=86.32s)]
*  You got Scott Horton's book. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=87.32s)]
*  They do have right here. I have, I have of course provoked. This is the early edition [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=88.32s)]
*  copy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  It's the fan mail. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  The fan mail doesn't need to be here. This by the way is a fantastic book. Rise and Kill [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  First. Ronan Bergman. Unbelievable. Really dark, but really, really good. This is the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=99.96s)]
*  was reading. First I had heard, I had heard the book recommended to me several times and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=107.92s)]
*  then Daryl Cooper was like, dude, you got to read Rise and Kill First. I don't know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=114.4s)]
*  Maybe I mentioned it, that it was like on my list of things to read. And he was like, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  dude, you got to read it. It's so good. And you know, Daryl Cooper tells you to read a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  book, you read a book. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=124.0s)]
*  But anyway, so I took it with me. I always, I bring books on the road. Usually that's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  when I get my reading done. So I took it with me to Austin and I'm reading this, but the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  book is about the history of targeted assassinations by the Mossad. And I'm reading it the day [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=136.12s)]
*  Donald Trump got shot, which was really just like, that'll start make you, that'll have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=141.14000000000001s)]
*  you connecting dots that maybe you shouldn't be connecting. You know what I mean? But it [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=147.36s)]
*  was just such a funny thing to be reading. And then like look on Twitter and be like, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=150.28s)]
*  oh yeah, I'm just gonna shut. All right. Well, okay. Anyway. Okay. A few points of order [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=155.36s)]
*  of business before we get into the show for today. Okay. Number one, this is, so there's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=163.76s)]
*  been a little bit of a change to our schedule. We are still coming to Buffalo. The Saturday [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  shows got canceled. It was a booking error on the club. So March 6th and 7th, we will [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  be in Buffalo, New York at Helium Comedy Club. March 8th, we're now doing some shows in St. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=185.92s)]
*  Catharines, which is just on the other side. You sure? Well, we're going to find out. All [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=191.96s)]
*  right. We're going to push our luck. We're the good kind, the self-hating kind. How about [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  that? Will you make it? Will you make an exception for a couple of self-hating Jews? We will [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=202.8s)]
*  find out. Canada. I have not been to Canada since the Just For Laughs Festival in 2017. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=205.84s)]
*  It was the last time I was up there. And I think I believe we had planned, I was planning [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=213.84s)]
*  to go up there during 2020. And then, you know, 2020 happened and Canada was not the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  place you wanted to be. So I have not been up there. And I do know, despite what a communist [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=226.72s)]
*  nightmare that country is, we do have some great fans up there in Canada. So looking [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=233.72s)]
*  forward to that. And out of support for the Prime Minister, I'll be performing in blackface. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=238.56s)]
*  Out of support. Rob's going to do all the shows in blackface going forward. Your legacy [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=245.88s)]
*  is not forgotten, Trudeau. Don't worry. And then, of course, later in the month, we got [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=250.72s)]
*  Boston coming up. I'm very excited to go back to Boston. And Laugh Boston's a great club. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=255.64s)]
*  And Boston's just like one of the best comedy towns in the world. So very excited to go [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=260.1s)]
*  back there. The other thing, which I do not believe I have mentioned this on the podcast [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=265.6s)]
*  I did tweet about it, but I am maybe I mentioned I can't remember. I talked too much. I am [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=271.24s)]
*  returning to the so we I should say are returning to the Soho Forum, the wonderful debate series [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=278.0s)]
*  run by the brilliant Gene Epstein. And Rob's going to do a comedy set. And then I am doing [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=284.88s)]
*  an Oxford style debate. I will be debating Alex. I do not mean this is a slight on him, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=292.88s)]
*  but I always get his last name wrong. Nor wash nor nor no no watch tear or something. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=300.96s)]
*  It's a it's not listen. I'll take 50% of the blame. I always say things wrong. But 50% [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=307.64s)]
*  of this is also on he's got a difficult name to say. But anyway, we're doing a debate about [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=313.48s)]
*  immigration or like the libertarian perspective on immigration. Me and Alex have had some not so [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=317.4s)]
*  pleasant back and forth on Twitter over the years. And we've both been kind of critical of the of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  the other one. But this is a debate that was long in the making. And, you know, it's always sad when [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=334.0s)]
*  somebody dies, but it's nice that now Alex is allowed to talk to me. So there's there's the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=342.24s)]
*  longtime guy at the Cato Institute, David Boas, who recently passed away, rest in peace, had a [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  firm rule about like people not talking to Mises Institute people, none of them were allowed to go [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=354.08s)]
*  on Tom Woods show or like anything like that. So now he's allowed to debate me again. And I am I'm [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  very much looking forward to this. I think it's going to be I think it's gonna be a great night [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=364.08s)]
*  and a really important topic, particularly in today's world, which is actually in the resolution. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=368.88s)]
*  There's something that's something like particularly in modern day America, libertarians [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=377.04s)]
*  ought to support restraints on immigration or something like that. So anyway, the host of the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Soho forum.org is the website, you can get tickets there. Last I heard these are moving fast, the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  event is going to sell out. So if you'd like if you're in the New York City area, and you'd like [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=393.04s)]
*  to come spend the night with me and Robbie the fire Bernstein, come on out, come on out. All right. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=397.28s)]
*  So there's a lot of stuff going on. I'm not exactly sure. You know, let's just start. Let's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=403.84s)]
*  start with the fun stuff. Okay, because there really is. I gotta say it's it's probably a little [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=410.08s)]
*  bit evil. How happy this made me. But Joy Reid has been canned at MSNBC. What can you say, Rob? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=418.96s)]
*  MSNBC is it's amazing. I don't understand how anybody's I don't understand how they haven't [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  closed up shop. I was looking just earlier at the numbers. The the ratings were so bad. I mean, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=438.64s)]
*  it she was Joy Reid in the key demo was doing like, you want to just take a guess? 200,000 people, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=448.64s)]
*  right? Because that'd be really bad. Yeah, right. 40,000. How's that possible? 40,000 in the key [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=456.96s)]
*  demo. That's a small podcast. I mean, it's literally like it's insane how much the show was failing. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=464.4s)]
*  And then and by the way, then like the you know, if they get 100,000 in the demo, that's like, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  oh, that's their number one show. That's like what Maddow does. Like she gets them like, oh, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=474.8s)]
*  that's why they had to bring her back. They have no one there. And then you just think about it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  Like, you know, I remember it was an interesting thing. Like once once podcasts first came out and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=483.44s)]
*  became a thing, I remember just thinking about it. Really, the comparison that I would make was [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=489.68s)]
*  Sirius Radio, because Sirius Radio had like, you know, some some comedy shows there. But then as [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  podcasts started getting big, you would just kind of look at it like on a just the business [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=499.44s)]
*  model of it. You're like, okay, so we the three of us, we're kind of doing a radio show right now, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=504.16s)]
*  right? Like, what really is the meaningful difference? It's on the internet versus being [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  on a thing that you have to have like in your car or whatever. I don't know. Okay, ours is out of the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=513.44s)]
*  garage of my house. That's our business model. I have a three car garage, I turned one of the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=520.0s)]
*  car garages into a little studio, okay, cost a few bucks to make this room and get the equipment [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  and build the walls. But like nothing that crazy. Your business model is we're launching satellites [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=531.84s)]
*  into outer space. I don't know what that runs you. But my guess is it's it's not cheap, you know? And [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=537.36s)]
*  so the same with MSNBC. Even you look, it's like these gigantic building in midtown, you know, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=545.84s)]
*  they're at the I think they're at the 30 Rock building. It's just like the the expenses that go [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  into all of this and then for the numbers to be this low. Anyway, how is it even shocking to anyone? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=558.24s)]
*  Like, what is MSNBC is like? Who's it for? It's like four leftists who love corporate America. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=565.28s)]
*  How big did you think that audience was? You know, and Joy Reid, I mean, for people who don't know, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=576.56s)]
*  the woman is I mean, she's got to be the dumbest woman in cable news. She's just like utterly [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=581.04s)]
*  retarded, knows nothing about anything, is a vicious racist. I mean, like, just point blank, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=589.52s)]
*  she's an insane racist. She sees everything through the prism of race. That's always been her thing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  And yeah, it just turned out that after a while, no one wants to fucking watch that shit. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=605.52s)]
*  Anyway, here she is. This is the fun part. Let's let's check in with as Tucker used to call her [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=610.0s)]
*  the crazy race lady over at MSNBC. Here she is. My show had value. And that I'm sorry, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=615.84s)]
*  that that what I was doing had value, had value. And in the end, I'm sorry, I'm not I try not to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=628.0s)]
*  cry on TV. And I think this is kind of like me on TV. So I apologize. And then and then it kind [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=636.48s)]
*  of ended it mattered. I see Karen is there and she's been texting me as well. And so what I will [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=642.0s)]
*  just say is that in the end, thank you. Where I land is that the moment that I have guilt that I [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=647.36s)]
*  felt that I went hard on so many issues, whether it was the Black Lives Matter issues of a young [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  baby or a mom or dad that was killed or when we opened up people's eyes to the fact that Asian [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=665.04s)]
*  Americans were being targeted and not just black folks that or immigrants who've done nothing. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=672.48s)]
*  Like my parents did, and try to make a life and defended them. Or whether we've talked about [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=679.92s)]
*  what the president is doing that is subversive to the Constitution, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  that is injurious to our liberty, defending books that people find inconvenient, that Nicole Hannah [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=692.48s)]
*  Jones put into our spirit that we need to understand 1619 as the real founding of this country, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=700.0799999999999s)]
*  whether it's talking about any of these issues. And yes, whether it's talking about Gaza and the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=706.16s)]
*  fact that we as the American people have a right to object to have a right to object to little babies [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=713.04s)]
*  being bombed. And where I come down on that is I'm not sorry. I am not sorry that I stood [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  up for those things because those things are of God. And I'm a church girl too. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=727.76s)]
*  And in a way you're kind of God. All right, essentially that's it. But there is something, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=735.52s)]
*  and you know, I remember saying this for years, Rob, but there is something about, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=742.48s)]
*  you know, the the look, I mean, there's really no other the blatant racism that kind of like swept [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=749.12s)]
*  culture and universities and stuff like this, over the particularly over the last decade, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=754.72s)]
*  probably goes back further than that. But I remember I always would say that, like, I would be [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=759.4399999999999s)]
*  I would be pretty goddamn livid. Like if my kids were ever going to a school, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=766.0s)]
*  and they were being taught that, like, you know, whiteness is evil or something like that, like, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=772.4s)]
*  that would definitely I would not want I would not send my kid to a school that, like, believed in [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=776.48s)]
*  an ideology that was bigoted toward them. But I would be ready to kill someone. If I had like a [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=782.64s)]
*  black kid, or if the the ideology was that white people are victims, and you are so wonderful, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=790.96s)]
*  and you're because I just think that's the most I think that's actually worse. Like, it's worse [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=797.84s)]
*  what they're doing to black kids in colleges than what they're doing to white kids in college, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=801.84s)]
*  because it is like the most poisonous thing to and you see people like her like just has it in her, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=806.1600000000001s)]
*  like, it's it's racial superiority is what you're teaching. And it's and also with like a victim [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=811.2800000000001s)]
*  guilt complex that almost always accompanies racial superiority, by the way. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=817.6s)]
*  And you just see all she can talk about is how great she was. That's why she got [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=823.2800000000001s)]
*  canceled because she was so great. Like, can you I just don't could I really can't imagine a scenario [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  where like, let's just say, you know, whatever the the views that our podcast gets, let's say they [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=833.52s)]
*  just evaporated. And after a while, I just went, it went down to like, no one's watching the show [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=840.32s)]
*  anymore, to the point that it's not economically sustainable, like just can't do it anymore. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=847.36s)]
*  I could never imagine not at least having some element of like, fuck, what did I do to lose my [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=852.32s)]
*  audience? You know, like, man, I guess I could, you know, even if I didn't think I was wrong about the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=859.84s)]
*  issue, I immediately my mind would go to like, I guess I'm not saying this in the right way. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=865.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, I guess I didn't like there's something something I did wrong. Not an inch of that. She's [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=869.84s)]
*  crying talking about how great she is, and how she's of God, and she's did everything right. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=875.52s)]
*  That's her takeaway. The dumbest person on cable news. That's what she thinks of herself. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=882.0s)]
*  Well, lucky for her. Unless she has a non compete cause clause, she can take her show to the open [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=887.84s)]
*  market, she can put it out on YouTube. And she could see how much the market actually values [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=893.36s)]
*  her programming. And maybe she'll make more money because she doesn't have to pay out a cut to MSNBC. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=899.04s)]
*  And she doesn't need that fancy studio and quite that roster of producers behind her. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=903.76s)]
*  It can't be that much less viewers. Yeah, I mean, I don't like it in a way when you say she it's [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=908.7199999999999s)]
*  got to be a higher profit margin for her to just go do a podcast at this point. But again, like, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=914.8s)]
*  you know, you know, these people just don't prove your value. You got all the you got an open contract [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=918.88s)]
*  now or someone else might just come scoop you up if MSNBC is not seeing it. But I think we all know, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=924.32s)]
*  I think the I think the gravy train of full scale socialism has come to a halt. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=930.0s)]
*  And as the Biden administration was ushered out, and people had placed their bets on [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=936.48s)]
*  continuation of socialism, and that the internet was going to be censored, and that there would [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=941.2800000000001s)]
*  continue to be state run propaganda, and that the they'd figure out how the pharmaceutical companies [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=946.4000000000001s)]
*  or whatever else were going to keep buying out these ad contracts that were going to know about [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=951.68s)]
*  nowhere, that you could pay for your propaganda. It seems like that's over. And I guess even networks [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=956.0s)]
*  like MSNBC are going to like Liz Alinsky at this point, they bet on the wrong administration, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=960.7199999999999s)]
*  and the profits aren't coming. So they got to figure something out. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=966.8s)]
*  There is something you make a great point. And it does just it feels like a Ponzi scheme falling [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=969.8399999999999s)]
*  apart. Yeah, you know, like it just has that feel, you know, the whole, you know, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=976.48s)]
*  so Bernie Madoff, who ran the biggest, who ran the excuse me, who ran the second biggest Ponzi scheme [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=981.6s)]
*  of all time next to the US government. There might be maybe the European Union or something [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=988.5600000000001s)]
*  is competing, but he ran a pretty the biggest private Ponzi scheme, I believe, of all time. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=993.44s)]
*  And his, you know, they like straight up just forged the documents, they didn't invest, they [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=998.8000000000001s)]
*  would send people like packets of all their investments. It was just complete bullshit, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1004.72s)]
*  right? So it's just constantly getting new, new investors to fund, I guess investors isn't the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1008.96s)]
*  right term, but getting new people's money and yeah, new suckers to pay out, you know, the old [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1014.72s)]
*  suckers. And he was paying like outrageous interest rates. Like I think he was paying 20% at one point. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1020.0s)]
*  Don't from what I recall, it was just that steady 10 to 12%. Oh, was it? I thought it was the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1025.68s)]
*  storyline was just that for so many years he was so consistent and deemed to be so safe, I believe, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1030.96s)]
*  but you might be right about I thought it was more than that, but regardless, so he's paying them out [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1036.24s)]
*  and if everyone's getting paid out, like even 10 to 12%, you get in a healthy path, everyone's kind [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1041.44s)]
*  of happy with that, you know, and it wasn't till the economy went south. And when the economy went [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1044.96s)]
*  south, he all I think it was only like, it's not like everyone asked for their money back, but enough [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1050.08s)]
*  big investors did that he didn't have nearly enough. And it's like, what's interesting about [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1055.84s)]
*  Ponzi schemes, House of Cards in general, is that they could take a very long time to build, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1060.8s)]
*  but man, they will fall over very quickly. And I think that's kind of what we're seeing [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1067.76s)]
*  in a lot of different fields. This I will say is one prediction that I really got right, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1073.12s)]
*  at least as of now. I got a few predictions pretty wrong about this last year, but I was arguing with [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1078.48s)]
*  I was arguing at one point with Michael Tracy, and I think it was Robbie Soave, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  who I was basically saying, you know, the best thing about Donald Trump, if he wins again, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  is that it's going to completely destroy the corporate media. And they were arguing with me [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1098.3200000000002s)]
*  somewhat reasonably. They were just like, well, no, actually, their ratings all went up the last [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1101.68s)]
*  time he was in. And my prediction on this, which I think has really come true, is just that, yeah, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1106.72s)]
*  but they're not going to be able to do that again, because it was all based off Russiagate. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1111.84s)]
*  And that completely fell apart. And then the COVID thing got so blown up that like, I just think [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1116.56s)]
*  people were underestimating how much so many people have woken up to like, oh, this is bullshit. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1121.04s)]
*  They're liars. They lie to us. Anyway, it's always nice just to see people get a little bit of [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1126.08s)]
*  comeuppance, you know what I mean? Like something, because it's just all these people are so goddamn [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1132.48s)]
*  awful. And it seems like nothing bad ever happens to them. So it's just nice. It's nice to see her [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1136.8s)]
*  cry. I don't know. Maybe that's kind of evil. This, I got to say, I enjoyed this too. Let's play the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1141.52s)]
*  Rachel Maddow clip. So here was Rachel Maddow, by the way, Anne Coulter. I can't remember which one [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1147.92s)]
*  of her books it was, but Anne Coulter wrote this. This has got to be over 10 years ago. But she [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1153.36s)]
*  wrote about this dynamic. And it was, and I used to watch MSNBC. And it was a real thing. If you [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1160.08s)]
*  watched it, you know what I'm talking about. But Rachel Maddow would always like go out of her way [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1165.76s)]
*  to be like extremely complimentary of Joy Reid. Like every time Joy Reid was on her show, she [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1173.44s)]
*  would introduce her as like the brilliant godsend Joy Reid. And it was always obviously this like [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1180.16s)]
*  weird liberal white guilt thing. And like, and then she'd be like, also Chris Hayes, like, you know, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1185.44s)]
*  I could say, who's like, I don't like Chris Hayes, but he's way smarter than Joy Reid. You know what [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1190.72s)]
*  I mean? So anyway, here's Rachel Maddow responding to the news of Joy Reid being fired. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1195.12s)]
*  And even bigger pro programming change is at 7pm, 7pm Eastern, where Joy Reid's show, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1202.8s)]
*  The Read Out ended tonight. And Joy is not taking a different job in the network. She is leaving the [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1209.9199999999998s)]
*  network altogether. And that is very, very, very hard to take. I am 51 years old. I have been [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1216.24s)]
*  gainfully employed since I was 12. And I have had so many different kinds of jobs, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1224.56s)]
*  you wouldn't believe me if I told you. But in all of the jobs I have had in all of the years I have [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1229.84s)]
*  been alive, there is no colleague for whom I have had more affection and more respect than Joy Reid. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1235.28s)]
*  I love everything about her. I have learned so much from her. I have so much more to learn from [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1242.64s)]
*  her. I do not want to lose her as a colleague here at MSNBC. And personally, I think it is a bad [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1248.0800000000002s)]
*  mistake to let her walk out the door. It is not my call. And I understand that. But that's what I [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1253.1200000000001s)]
*  think. I will tell you, it is also unnerving to see that on a network where we've got two, count them, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1259.2800000000002s)]
*  two non-white hosts in primetime, both of our non-white hosts in primetime are losing their [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1266.56s)]
*  shows, as is Katie Fang on the weekend. And that feels worse than bad, no matter who replaces them. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1272.96s)]
*  That feels indefensible. And I do not defend it. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1280.08s)]
*  Isn't it, by the way, she certainly did learn a thing or two from Joy Reid, make everything a race [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1285.84s)]
*  issue and accuse everyone of being a bigot. But it is wild to me that, I mean, again, as I said [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1291.52s)]
*  before, her numbers weren't bad. They were atrocious. And for you to say like, it's unnerving [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1297.68s)]
*  and this feels worse than bad, that like what, so you somehow in these woke people's mind, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1305.36s)]
*  you just get to call your boss a bigot, completely unfounded when there's obvious cause for it to [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1312.24s)]
*  cancel the show. That's what happens in shows. If nobody wants to watch it, the show gets canceled. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1318.96s)]
*  This has been true from the beginning of shows. That's how it works. And yet she's gonna, and like, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1325.28s)]
*  as if you can't just in your own mind think of the obvious retort, which is that like, I don't know, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1332.72s)]
*  in what worldview, even in like a left-wingers worldview, do you think if Joy Anne Reid's show [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1339.44s)]
*  was getting 10 million viewers a night, MSNBC would be like, damn it, just black is succeeding. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1345.28s)]
*  You know, I just, hey, you know, is that how big corporations are? Not unless they're showing [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1353.76s)]
*  January 6 footage. Yeah, right. Exactly. Well, you know, you got to point that what you'd have to do [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1357.52s)]
*  to get those ratings might actually press them off. But it's like, it's just such an obvious thing [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1362.56s)]
*  where it's like these decisions aren't being made. Who cares who the non-white hosts are? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1366.72s)]
*  But it's like, what are the, you're in a business and nobody sees value. It's pretty funny, by the [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1372.8000000000002s)]
*  way, Joy Anne Reid being like, my show has value and like, yes, it does. And the market has decided [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1379.28s)]
*  the value is zero. That is the value of your show. It went to zero. If you're sure, like you said, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1384.88s)]
*  Rob, if your show has so much value, take it to the internet, find out how much value it has. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1390.5600000000002s)]
*  And the news shows do well. I mean, Glenn Beck did great after leaving Fox News. Megan [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1394.64s)]
*  Kelly's doing fine. Tucker Carlson's doing fine. On top of the world. Yeah. So you are welcome to [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1399.28s)]
*  put your show up on the internet and get all that value for yourself without having to share it with [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1403.92s)]
*  MSNBC. And as for that lady, Maddow, you know, you could leave in solidarity if you honestly believe [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1408.6399999999999s)]
*  that you're working for racists. Yeah. If you honestly think you're working for racists or [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1418.96s)]
*  it's inappropriate to have a network that doesn't have a showing amongst minorities. So I guess as [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1422.8s)]
*  the white person, you can make a difference and say, I will stand with the minorities until they [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1428.32s)]
*  have a better showing on this network, because otherwise what we're doing is wrong. Because I [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1433.52s)]
*  guess it's not even it's because we're clearly being racist and overlooking the talent pool [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1438.48s)]
*  that's out there. Right. That should be contributing. Yeah. I mean, so I mean, how dare her be a part of [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1444.32s)]
*  such a racist institution? It is, you know, it is it's kind of a similar type of argument that [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1450.48s)]
*  we've made about Bernie Sanders before not giving away his third home or his million dollars or [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1457.44s)]
*  something like that. It's like it's the same. You know, you've seen like people who go like [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1462.3200000000002s)]
*  to college campuses, conservatives would make that point a lot. Like they'd be like, OK, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1467.04s)]
*  it's a white students be like, why don't you give up your spot here for like a minority? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1470.56s)]
*  I don't know if you believe in this. Like I just I do think it's a very fair point. And there is [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1474.3200000000002s)]
*  and a very exposing one that it's like, yeah, you're saying you work for a bunch of racists. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1481.1200000000001s)]
*  So like, stop, stop working for them. Stop. Catch. Oh, the checks are pretty good, though. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1486.72s)]
*  Right. So you're still going to take all that money. But don't let it be said that I didn't [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1492.8s)]
*  call them racist before I took all their money. I just I don't know. I guess it's hard to even [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1496.32s)]
*  like come up with the words because it's just so it's so obvious in a way. But it's like it's [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1506.24s)]
*  Rachel Maddow in that clip couldn't have given you better evidence for why no one wants to watch [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1513.04s)]
*  MSNBC anymore. It's like this is so incredibly stupid. It's like this is your deep analysis on [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1519.9199999999998s)]
*  everything. It's not just Joy Reid being fired. It's everything just comes down to like your one [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1528.24s)]
*  dumb talking point about race or sex or sexual orientation or whatever. It's like this is just [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1534.08s)]
*  it's it's it requires you to turn your brain off to think this way. And then you also have to like [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1541.76s)]
*  pretend we're living in a world that we're not living in. Listen, it's so it's like I said before [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1548.56s)]
*  the example like you have this whole freak out over covid. Meanwhile, the real health crisis is [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1555.52s)]
*  obesity. You have this entire freak out over Doge. Meanwhile, the real crisis is the government [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1561.12s)]
*  you know, debt spiral. And likewise, the fact that you could sit here and and and say that it's [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1568.96s)]
*  racist that Joyanne Reid was fired. This country, Joy, Joy Reid went to Harvard and was then [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1577.76s)]
*  an anchor of a news show for like 15 years. And she's fucking retarded. Okay. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1588.88s)]
*  Like the story here is not that this country has been so horribly racist to her. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1596.72s)]
*  The story is that it's insane that we bend over backward to pretend that someone like her has [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1600.96s)]
*  anything impressive to say. And you know, it's just it's you know, it's like this weird thing. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1607.2s)]
*  This victim like race ideology. It's like you got these people at the top who grift off of it and [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1614.64s)]
*  make millions of dollars. But the ideology that they're selling is so poisonous. And it is like, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1620.8799999999999s)]
*  it's like basically those are your only options. It's like you can grift off this somehow, or you [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1628.3999999999999s)]
*  can let it ruin your life. And you think about like the generation of kids who came out of [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1632.72s)]
*  universities over the last 10 years, and how much this stuff was pumped down their throats. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1637.6s)]
*  It's just like, it's a horrible thing to do a horrible thing to do, especially to like young [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1643.76s)]
*  impressionable people. Thank God, not too many people are watching this garbage because Jesus [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1649.84s)]

*  I'm not going to psychoanalyze her, but she was a Rhodes scholar. She's not a dummy. And she's like, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1736.4s)]
*  the fact that she's like bought into all this stuff is I don't know. It's it's, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1742.64s)]
*  it's what pays the bills for now. Yeah, I guess so. But it is it is truly madness, truly madness. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1746.96s)]
*  Um, all right, you want to let's see, what should we what should we do next, Rob? What [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1753.12s)]
*  you want to talk about Dan Crenshaw? We want to talk about we could do Ukraine. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1758.16s)]
*  Or Mike Baker on Joe Rogan. What do you think? Let's do Crenshaw Ukraine. I feel like the two [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1765.1200000000001s)]
*  go hand in hand. All right. So Dan Crenshaw. I don't know if you guys saw this. Oh, here you [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1770.8000000000002s)]
*  can let's play the video. You can hear it from him. I think the audio is not great. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1779.2s)]
*  I like the leprechaun outfit, though. It's not his worst look. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1782.96s)]
*  Have you ever met? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1790.4s)]
*  All right. So if you couldn't quite make that out, Dan Crenshaw in this hot mic [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1802.32s)]
*  thing here, he says if he ever meets Tucker Carlson, he will fucking kill him. He says he's [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1809.76s)]
*  the worst person. And at one point in there, he says, I'm not kidding, which is what a lot [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1816.24s)]
*  of people were jumping on. I think you had a take on this that you expressed before the show, Rob, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1820.48s)]
*  I think you're correct on this. So if you go ahead, give give your thought. Yeah, it's very [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1825.92s)]
*  leftist to go words or violence. That sounds like dude bravado to me. Yeah. And does not actually [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1830.16s)]
*  sound like a threat. Yes, I completely agree. I think it's like the people who are first of all, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1836.3999999999999s)]
*  I got to say, honestly, my opinion on this is that I don't I don't like leaked hot mics, unless [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1842.8s)]
*  it's like, with the exception of government officials talking about government policy, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1852.3999999999999s)]
*  that that would be my exception to that, like the John Kerry hot mic or the Netanyahu secret [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1857.6s)]
*  recording, stuff like that I'm fine with, you know, if it's if it's the Prime Minister of Israel [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1862.56s)]
*  talking about how he tricks the Americans into supporting his wars, then okay, sure, that's [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1868.32s)]
*  leak that. But when it's just stuff like this, I just don't like it. I feel the same way about [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1873.44s)]
*  like text messages. You know, there was like a there was some Angela McCardell, the former [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1878.8s)]
*  chair of the Libertarian Party, I remember they had some she someone like had leaked some of her [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1885.84s)]
*  like a group chat or something like that. And it was like messages that came out right around the [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1891.44s)]
*  time when I pulled out and wasn't running. And she was saying some like, you know, not the nicest [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1896.8s)]
*  stuff about me. And people were like sending it to me like, Oh, look what she said. And I'm like, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1903.3600000000001s)]
*  stop sending this to me. Like she didn't say that to me. And she's saying it privately. And then [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1907.1200000000001s)]
*  someone's going around. And you're also like, look, people are allowed to vent, they're allowed to [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1912.16s)]
*  have a moment like that. You know what I mean? Like, it's just and people I think, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1916.16s)]
*  you know, sometimes like, I think about it, like the example I would give is like, if somebody, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1922.48s)]
*  let's say somebody like hacked into your text messages. And let's say you're like, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1928.16s)]
*  let's say you're in a long term relationship or a marriage or something like that. And they they [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1933.28s)]
*  found the text messages from the worst fight you guys had, you know, and then we're like, look, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1938.24s)]
*  who he is behind closed doors. And you make it's not really a rep, you know, that this was a thing [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1944.0s)]
*  in the moment, you kind of said it, it may this is to me something like that. And I don't like [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1949.1999999999998s)]
*  judging people off of that. I'd rather judge Dan Crenshaw off his terrible track record. So there's [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1954.3999999999999s)]
*  plenty more to say about that. And look, where that's really where the the meat of this is, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1961.12s)]
*  what is his beef with Tucker Carlson really? Oh, Tucker Carlson doesn't want to fight forever wars. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1970.88s)]
*  That's really his issue. And I probably been, you know, he's been highly critical of Crenshaw. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1976.4s)]
*  But Tucker Carlson's response was just amazing. Tucker Carlson responded. Now this is this is the [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1981.76s)]
*  correct anti woke way to deal with these things. Okay, you don't go like, Oh, my God, teacher, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1987.2s)]
*  teacher, he's threatening me. No, he's not. He wasn't threatening Tucker Carlson, the people [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1992.96s)]
*  jumping on that you're being silly. You're doing the old confirmation bias thing and you're on my [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=1997.28s)]
*  team. So like, I'm not I don't disagree with you. Crenshaw sucks. He's the worst. Tucker's awesome. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2001.76s)]
*  But this was not a real threat or a call to violence. Like, let's not let's not be children [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2008.48s)]
*  about this. Let's not be Rachel Maddow about this situation here. Okay, let's grow up. That's not [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2014.96s)]
*  what it is. Tucker Carlson's response was perfect. He goes, Why don't you come sit for a one on one [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2019.68s)]
*  interview? I'll send you my address. There you go. That's the perfect because first of all, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2024.08s)]
*  Dan Crenshaw isn't doing anything to anybody is like you can play this Mr. Tough Guy bullshit or [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2031.6s)]
*  whatever. But the truth is that Dan Crenshaw just got invited on the biggest second biggest show in [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2037.9199999999998s)]
*  the world to go sit down and make your and if you're a Republican policymaker, probably the [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2046.88s)]
*  biggest show for your target demographic. This is you know, these are the big these aren't joy read [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2055.52s)]
*  numbers talking about millions and millions of people watching the show. And you're invited to [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2062.32s)]
*  come on and make your case. And he won't because he knows Tucker would humiliate him. Like absolutely [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2067.2000000000003s)]
*  body him the same way he did. You know, what's what's Mike Pence doing politically? Oh, nothing [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2074.56s)]
*  since Tucker fucking bodied him. So what do you want to do? Go on the Tucker show and then go the [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2080.32s)]
*  way of Mike Pence. He'll end your political career if you go on that show. So literally now you're [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2086.32s)]
*  out there you know, like saying you're going to kill the guy and you just look like the biggest [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2092.48s)]
*  pussy in the world because you're scared to have a conversation with them. By the way, not the only [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2095.36s)]
*  person you're scared to have a conversation with. But that's another story for another day. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2100.8s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, I don't know what I guess we could transition from that into the Ukraine stuff [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2105.84s)]
*  because it does certainly seem like Tucker Carlson and the the more non interventionist wing, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2110.6400000000003s)]
*  which we would both fall into does it does seem like we are kind of winning the day on this. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2121.04s)]
*  Even, you know, as is always kind of the case, right, Rob, I think this is true with almost every [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2128.88s)]
*  issue. I think almost every issue over this show since me and you have been doing the show together [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2136.2400000000002s)]
*  that you would say was like a major focus of ours, we almost always get vindicated on it. I actually [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2141.52s)]
*  say always on the major ones. And even now I just see you know, because I did a lot of these Ukraine [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2147.52s)]
*  debates over the last couple years. And even now I see the tone has totally changed. Like even when [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2154.32s)]
*  I'm arguing with other people on the other side, everybody's kind of nobody's saying that we have [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2160.16s)]
*  to fund them forever. Ukraine will win. Ukrainians just want to fight. We're going to take back [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2165.2s)]
*  Crimea. No one's saying any of this shit anymore. It's like the conversation has just turned in our [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2171.36s)]
*  favor. And as is the case often with these things is just because the reality on the ground is just [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2176.4s)]
*  at a certain point, it's kind of undeniable. You know, this is ultimately what broke the COVID [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2182.4s)]
*  discussion. It wasn't that our arguments were just so good that we persuaded everybody. It was really [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2188.32s)]
*  Omicron. Omicron did what none of us could do. And it was just that it tore through and infected [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2194.48s)]
*  the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. And it was so contagious and so everywhere that no one could [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2201.28s)]
*  pretend that any of these measures had been successful or that it was just like the whole [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2207.6s)]
*  thing fell apart under the weight of its own bullshit. And the same thing is happening in [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2211.92s)]
*  Ukraine right now. You know, they in order to and this is pretty unanimously agreed upon now by [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2216.08s)]
*  almost all the top military people that in order to expel Russia from Ukraine, even Europe couldn't [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2224.56s)]
*  do it. Like it would take the 82nd Airborne. Like that's what we'd have to do. We'd have to go [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2231.68s)]
*  World War Two style into Ukraine to fucking kick and America could do that. Like we probably are [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2238.7999999999997s)]
*  the only ones who could do it. But nobody actually believes like nobody thinks we're there is just no [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2245.04s)]
*  way that there is support at all in America to go to war with the biggest nuclear superpower in the [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2254.08s)]
*  history of the world to risk our own kids lives to make sure that Luhansk doesn't fall under the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2260.16s)]
*  control of Moscow because Luhansk must be ruled by Kiev. Nobody's on board with that. And so [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2266.3199999999997s)]
*  there Dan Crenshaw has and the other Warhawks have just kind of lost this argument. And much like [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2273.12s)]
*  COVID, the people that were telling us that this was winnable and they just needed our support, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2280.48s)]
*  they should be held accountable because a lot of people lost their lives for absolutely no reason. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2286.2400000000002s)]
*  And now as we find out that some of the territories on the border, I guess, were [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2291.44s)]
*  rich mining areas, the whole thing seems even dumber to have risked. Yeah, yeah, no, that's [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2295.12s)]
*  that's exactly right. The thing I'm most curious to see is what exactly is the nature of this [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2300.7200000000003s)]
*  precious metals agreement that Donald Trump is pushing for. Because if we're ending the war [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2308.4s)]
*  and Ukraine's going to have to give up territory for the war being over and part of ending the [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2315.12s)]
*  war is that Ukraine's giving up territory and they will not be joining NATO, it seems overly [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2320.1600000000003s)]
*  punitive for us to demand that as a part of the war, we also get mineral rights. What I'm confused [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2326.96s)]
*  on is, I guess, maybe if all of the resources that were given to them was only supposed to be alone [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2333.6s)]
*  and they just had a bad bet on Biden that it wasn't going to be recalled and now you got a [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2339.28s)]
*  new administration and that perhaps that is a warning to future regimes of siding with America [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2343.12s)]
*  or trying to go with bad policymakers. It's interesting because it's like it seems overly [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2352.08s)]
*  punitive and not fair. But is it not fair in that it's good because it's a warning not to work with [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2357.2s)]
*  the United States of America? Or does it become a problem kind of like the Gaddafi nuclear thing [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2362.4s)]
*  where he actually did work with us and now we'll never get someone else to disarm again [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2367.68s)]
*  because then we threw him under the bus. So in terms of just the fear of America looking weak, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2371.92s)]
*  I don't know, these are not really my concerns, but I'm just saying for everyone that said, hey, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2378.7200000000003s)]
*  we have to defend the red line in Ukraine because if Putin thinks he can expand, then China's going [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2383.44s)]
*  to go to Taiwan and we look weak and that's bad for the world order, so we have to defend borders. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2389.44s)]
*  What is this new situation if now we're really the bad guy and we talked Ukraine into the war, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2395.6s)]
*  we back them, we didn't let them step out of it when we sent Boris Johnson over there, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2400.8s)]
*  and now afterwards we're like, and you owe us half of your country's future wealth. That's crazy. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2405.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I said the other day on the show, I think it was the one where you weren't on, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2411.76s)]
*  but I said it's like it's gangster shit. It's just a pure shakedown. And of course, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2416.8s)]
*  this is the nature of governments. This is what they do. I think the thing that people like about [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2424.96s)]
*  Donald Trump is that he's at least doing gangster shit in his own mind of what's in the interest of [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2428.72s)]
*  our country. But I agree. Look, Donald Trump, I was mentioning this to you before the show. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2435.52s)]
*  But that's the thing. I don't know if it's in our interest to let everyone know we're bad partners [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2441.68s)]
*  because we'll throw you under the bus. Yeah. No, I... Yes. There's also a strong argument that it's... [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2446.48s)]
*  Unless it's just channels of we're good partners, but if you're partnering with our deep state, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2451.8399999999997s)]
*  they're going to throw you under the bus and lie to you. But I don't know if that's... [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2454.3999999999996s)]
*  I agree with you that it's quite possibly in our short term interest, but not in our long term [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2457.12s)]
*  interest to just get some minerals, but then nakedly be seen as doing this gangster shit. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2462.64s)]
*  I do think that there's... I mentioned this to you. I'll quickly tell the story. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2469.92s)]
*  So I have my high school English teacher who I liked. He was a good guy. And he was one of my [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2478.56s)]
*  few teachers who I liked in high school. And he just the other day tagged me on Facebook, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2485.52s)]
*  which I don't even use anymore. I happened to just go on it and I saw it there. It was like, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2494.24s)]
*  oh shit, Mr. Shaltane. So he wrote... And it was a New York Times piece, an interview with Brett [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2498.64s)]
*  Stevens, who I... It was just like the absolute worst. And he was like, oh, this is really [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2507.92s)]
*  interesting. I'm curious your thoughts, Dave. And it was Brett Stevens saying that Donald Trump is [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2512.96s)]
*  transforming us into a predator state and he likes the dictator rather than liking the guy [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2518.0s)]
*  defending democracy. And I was just... It was like, he's a liberal, I think. And everybody [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2524.88s)]
*  got commenting on his page was a liberal. And it's like, you're almost trying to go like... [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2529.76s)]
*  I tried to approach it the right way where I was like, okay, look, first off, here's who [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2534.0s)]
*  Brett Stevens is. This is neoconservative, Brett Stevens. The neoconservative label [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2538.4s)]
*  ought to tell you liberals, you don't have to be on his side. You know what I mean? And I said, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2547.36s)]
*  I mentioned in there, because I'm always trying to attack the left from the left type thing. I was [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2552.48s)]
*  like, you remember when Obama made fun of Mitt Romney for saying Russia is our biggest enemy? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2556.32s)]
*  He was right. Mitt Romney was wrong. Why do you have to support the Cold War? You're fucking [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2562.16s)]
*  liberals. Literally, Brett Stevens wrote... I'm not making this up. Two years ago, on the 20-year [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2568.7999999999997s)]
*  anniversary of the war in Iraq, Brett Stevens wrote a piece for the New York Times and it was [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2576.72s)]
*  titled something like Why I Was Right to Cheerlead the War in Iraq. And in his piece makes no mention [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2584.72s)]
*  of the million people who got killed in the thing. He just said, well, Saddam was a bad dictator and [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2590.32s)]
*  that bad dictator ain't there anymore. So no, I don't regret being against that bad dictator. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2595.36s)]
*  No mention of the young men who enlisted and went and fought there. By the way, Brett Stevens was a [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2599.36s)]
*  pretty young guy when this happened and he wasn't amongst them, would you believe that? The young [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2605.6800000000003s)]
*  men who went over there whose lives are ruined now, forget the ones just who committed suicide, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2609.1200000000003s)]
*  but the ones who are like double amputees or just are horribly depressed and can't unsee the shit [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2613.6000000000004s)]
*  that they did over there, all that. No mention of any of that. No mention of any of the cause. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2619.36s)]
*  And that guy's going to tell you that ending a war makes us a predator nation because Donald [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2623.52s)]
*  Trump is saying some nice things about Putin on the way there. And there was a lot... I was on [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2630.08s)]
*  Piers Morgan the other day and they were making a lot over this UN resolution. There's a UN resolution [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2635.04s)]
*  to condemn Russia and the US didn't vote for it. And they're all going, oh my God, you don't see... [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2641.92s)]
*  Like on Piers Morgan, the panel, he loves authoritarians or something. And you're like, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2649.84s)]
*  guys, why? What's to be gained? He's trying to negotiate a peace with this guy. You just [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2653.28s)]
*  want him to come out and call him mean names? And I'm not even saying... Look, obviously, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2659.76s)]
*  Donald Trump was the art of the deal and in business, he's known as this negotiator. That [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2664.8s)]
*  doesn't always work out the same way in government. And I think he's failed at several negotiations [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2669.68s)]
*  in his first term. And I don't think the way he's talking about Gaza is a good negotiating strategy. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2676.48s)]
*  But come on, it would just be so stupid for Donald Trump at this point to just piss Putin off for no [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2682.16s)]
*  reason. It's pure virtue signaling just to say, he's a dictator. I condemn what he did. We're trying [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2689.2s)]
*  to end a war here. It's just insane that people think this way. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2696.24s)]
*  Yeah. And just condemn Biden for getting everyone into this mess for absolutely no reason. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2701.2s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2706.4799999999996s)]
*  Monetary Metals. I've been telling you guys about this company for a while. I love these guys, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2710.16s)]
*  great people who work there and they're really revolutionizing the precious metal space. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2715.3599999999997s)]
*  There's a better way to own gold and silver now. And that is with Monetary Metals because you're [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2720.0s)]
*  not just owning gold, you're not just owning silver, you're owning precious metals that work [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2725.76s)]
*  for you. And they generate interest in gold and silver paid in gold and silver. For the last [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2730.96s)]
*  eight years, Monetary Metals has been paying clients between two to five percent on their [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2738.0s)]
*  physical gold and silver holdings, all while enjoying free storage and insurance. So straight [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2742.4s)]
*  up, if you're just collecting fees for storing your gold or silver, you're doing it all wrong. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2748.4s)]
*  Go to Monetary Metals. You don't have to pay those fees. Plus you get interest in gold and silver, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2754.0s)]
*  so you're increasing your total ounces over time. Check them out at monetary-metals.com to learn [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2758.88s)]
*  more about putting your precious metals to work today. That's monetary-metals.com. All right, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2765.76s)]
*  let's get back into the show. Well, that's really the issue. You know, the issue is so big, you know, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2772.08s)]
*  as far as I can tell on this, and this is what I said to my former English teacher, that I was [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2777.2s)]
*  like, look, like, Brett Stevens making this big thing out of why he's, you know, how he's talking [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2782.96s)]
*  shit to Zelensky. And he's saying, oh, this is because Donald Trump wants to transform us from [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2788.0s)]
*  this nation that supports democracy to a nation that supports dictatorship or whatever. And it's [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2793.36s)]
*  like, no, no, Zelensky pissed him off. Zelensky, it's been pretty widely reported and has been said, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2797.84s)]
*  I think, by the people in the meeting. I think it was, I think if I'm not, if I'm remembering [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2807.52s)]
*  this correctly, I think it was Hegseth and Rubio met with Zelensky. And then he came out in the [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2812.56s)]
*  Ukrainian press and like totally misrepresented, at least they claim misrepresented what was said [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2819.2s)]
*  in the media. And he was somewhat, he was critical of Donald Trump in the Ukrainian media. And Donald [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2823.44s)]
*  Trump, being the pettiest human being who's ever lived, is like what he does, what he always does. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2829.36s)]
*  And he starts talking shit. Like, that's how Donald Trump is. Now, listen, it's not the best [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2835.68s)]
*  quality in Donald Trump. One of the better qualities about Donald Trump is that he'll move [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2841.2s)]
*  on from that shit immediately if there's a deal to be made. Like, it doesn't matter what he said [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2844.8799999999997s)]
*  to you or what you say to him. If you can do business after that, he's totally fine to do [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2848.7999999999997s)]
*  business. But if anybody, he has, he has the fragilist of egos. And yeah, if you talk shit [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2852.3199999999997s)]
*  about him, he's going to come up with a nickname for you. That's how Donald Trump works, whether [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2859.4399999999996s)]
*  you like it or not. That just is the situation. So look, again, to your point, you know, when he says [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2864.0s)]
*  that Zelensky started the war, that is kind of fucked up. Because it's like, really, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2871.6s)]
*  like, there's an argument. But the argument would be, you know, like, look, there's a there's a very [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2880.0s)]
*  strong argument to just say Vladimir Putin started the war. Vladimir Putin invaded the country. And [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2885.2s)]
*  there's, you know, I don't even, you know, I've seen different figures about the wars, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2889.68s)]
*  and how many people have died and the ratio of Russians to Ukrainians. But I think it's, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2893.9199999999996s)]
*  there, it's pretty much, there's a consensus that it's it's in the hundreds of thousands of people [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2899.04s)]
*  and probably high hundreds of thousands at this point. And Vladimir Putin did that, you know, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2905.52s)]
*  he decided to take it to the level of invading. And in Scott's book, he has a chapter on like, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2911.12s)]
*  what the other options are that he could have done other than invade the country. And I do think [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2916.24s)]
*  that Scott's right about it. Like, it's not, it's not justified what he did. But you really could [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2920.48s)]
*  argue that the Obama administration started the war in 2014. I mean, that I don't think there's [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2926.64s)]
*  an argument that Zelensky started the war. I mean, yes, you could say he didn't implement the Minsk [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2933.8399999999997s)]
*  agreements or whatever. And yes, he was the he you could blame him for the part of the civil war that [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2938.64s)]
*  he was responsible for. But look, like, I mean, I know, I've said this before, I'm sure I'll say it [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2944.48s)]
*  again. But and I said this the other day on Piers Morgan show, too. And also, they had like a general [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2949.44s)]
*  who I was not familiar with, because a general was on the show. He totally backed me up on this, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2956.0s)]
*  which I was not. I was thinking, oh, I'm going to have to debate this general guy, which is always [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2959.76s)]
*  a little intimidating, because, you know, they're just like, you know, I'm a fucking podcaster, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2964.0s)]
*  and he's a goddamn general in the military. But then he totally backed me up on it. And I was [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2969.12s)]
*  just like, Look, what do you and I just said the old thing, I go, Look, just game this out. What [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2973.68s)]
*  would we do? What would America do if China said they were gonna bring Mexico into their military [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2978.16s)]
*  alliance? And then we were very concerned about that. And then the president of Mexico decided [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2988.24s)]
*  he wasn't going to do a deal. Like as China saying they're going to bring them into their military [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=2996.16s)]
*  lines, they're also floating out in economic partnership. And then the president of Mexico [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3001.2s)]
*  goes, Now, you know what, I'm not going to join this partnership, this economic partnership with [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3005.76s)]
*  China, I'm going to join an economic partnership with our neighbor, the United States of America. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3010.5600000000004s)]
*  And then China pumped 10s of millions of dollars into a protest movement against that president, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3016.0800000000004s)]
*  democratically elected and got him overthrown from power. And then the new guy joined that deal [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3021.84s)]
*  with them. Like, what would we do? And if you don't think that Washington DC would invade that [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3027.28s)]
*  country in a second, there is simply no way that we would ever tolerate that. And in fact, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3034.32s)]
*  that's what got America into World War One was that they said they were saying it wasn't even [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3042.7200000000003s)]
*  ever going to happen. But they said Mexico was going to join in with their alliance. We went, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3049.44s)]
*  Okay, well, then total war. Then that's our response to that. And what was Jack Kennedy's [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3053.44s)]
*  response to them putting nuclear weapons in Cuba? He said, I'm treating that as a nuclear attack on [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3059.6s)]
*  the United States of America, meaning I will blow up the world. Like, and I'll tell you, I don't know [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3066.64s)]
*  too many people even real non interventionist libertarian types, which are the circles I swim [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3074.48s)]
*  in. I don't know too many people who think Jack Kennedy was wrong to say that, to say that like, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3078.88s)]
*  no, no, we cannot tolerate nuclear weapons in Cuba pointed at America. I mean, you know, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3084.4s)]
*  what fucking close Cuba is to us like we were down there. We were just down in Key West right there. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3090.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we're right there. It's just right there. People raft over from Cuba, kind of nuclear [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3094.2400000000002s)]
*  weapons pointed at you from there. It's a knife to your throat, which is the I think was a line [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3100.0s)]
*  Putin said about the about military hardware in Poland. So this is like a knife to our throat. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3104.88s)]
*  And that's in Poland. Ukraine is closer, you know, so again, I think the Donald Trump shit [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3111.2799999999997s)]
*  talking Zelensky, I think is personal and doesn't really add much to the negotiating. But I think [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3119.6s)]
*  saying nice things about Vladimir Putin is like, that's just a smart negotiating tactic right now. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3127.52s)]
*  People can have a problem with it if they want to. But I don't see what you know, it's like in [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3133.7599999999998s)]
*  in DC, it's just forever wars never make you that that never turns you into a predator state. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3140.0800000000004s)]
*  But yet the say as soon as somebody actually looks like they're going to end one, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3147.28s)]
*  that's when all these people start attacking is the most upside down demonic, like thinking. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3151.44s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't seen or I don't think the full details on it are available. At first, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3156.96s)]
*  it seemed to me that perhaps we were going to continue to back the war. But we were saying we [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3161.6000000000004s)]
*  want mineral rights in return for backing. Now it sounds like no wars over and we still want the [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3166.64s)]
*  mineral rights, which either sounds punitive, or perhaps Donald Trump has some different play in [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3172.8799999999997s)]
*  mind, which is specifically to get Zelensky out and then maybe cut a better deal with somebody else. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3178.96s)]
*  But I also don't understand the security guarantee. So they're not going to be a part of NATO, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3185.44s)]
*  but the US is going to be more invested in the country and Putin is going to be okay with that. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3189.68s)]
*  And I don't understand how you don't end up with essentially the relationship we have with Taiwan [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3193.92s)]
*  with the semiconductors, where we've stupidly rely on the semiconductors there, but we're not [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3197.52s)]
*  actually in it. We're not we don't actually have the ability to defend. Right. So why would we have [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3203.6800000000003s)]
*  the strategic asset there? So on the same note, if we're not actually going to go to war with Russia [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3208.56s)]
*  over strategic asset in Ukraine of minerals, then firstly, it's not a guarantee. And then it's dumb [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3214.32s)]
*  to be relying on that or cultivating it as a strategic asset. Look, I mean, I can't say [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3219.84s)]
*  anything other than it's just gangster shit. I mean, that's you're right that that's how the [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3223.6000000000004s)]
*  Trump administration is trying to sell it to Ukraine. They're trying to sell like, well, hey, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3228.08s)]
*  if we're very invested in you, because you give us your minerals, then well, then we'd have an [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3232.88s)]
*  interest in Vladimir Putin not coming in and invading. But at the same time, we're saying, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3238.96s)]
*  you can't join NATO, we can't give you security guarantees. So in other words, it's just like [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3244.08s)]
*  give us your shit. And then we'll be incentivized to protect you. PS, we're not going to protect you. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3249.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's and look, I mean, I just I also do think this is this is my view of the situation [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3258.1600000000003s)]
*  is that I think that, like, the people of Ukraine, you know, forget their criminal government, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3264.32s)]
*  forget the Russian criminal government and our criminal government for a minute, but the people [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3271.36s)]
*  of Ukraine have been real victims of all three of these criminal organizations, like the worst [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3276.16s)]
*  victims of this whole thing have been the people of Ukraine have lost their fucking country. It's [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3282.8799999999997s)]
*  been destroyed. You know, many of the women and children fled at the very beginning. And many of [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3287.44s)]
*  the men were not allowed to there. You know, it's unbelievable, too. You know, it reminds me of like [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3293.44s)]
*  the stuff with all these wars. It's always like, you know, I bring this up now almost every time [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3299.36s)]
*  I'm on Piers Morgan, because that you know, the topics he I almost always end up talking about [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3306.1600000000003s)]
*  either Ukraine or Gaza when I'm on there. And I will I'll make a point to just bring up how you [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3310.48s)]
*  know, all the talking points that I was arguing last year on this have all been abandoned. You [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3316.4s)]
*  know what I mean? Like all the stuff I had to argue for like remember, Piers eight months ago, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3321.28s)]
*  10 months ago, when I was doing this, and this was the thing I had to argue, you know, the [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3325.36s)]
*  the Gaza Health Ministry is inflating the numbers. You don't hear that too much anymore, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3329.6000000000004s)]
*  because all you got to do is look at the drone footage of Gaza and be like, No, I don't think [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3334.4s)]
*  they are. I don't think I don't think they are at all. And all this like, oh, Hamas uses them as [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3337.6000000000004s)]
*  human shields or something like that. All of it. All of it. That's when you look at a picture of [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3342.96s)]
*  southern Gaza, and there's nothing and every single building has been destroyed. What are you [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3349.76s)]
*  telling me? Hamas said that Israel estimated that Hamas had like, I think 40,000 fighters at the [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3354.16s)]
*  beginning of the war. So like, just do the math here with me, there was a Hamas, you know, cell [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3359.04s)]
*  in every single one of these buildings. I don't think so. And so anyway, but with in Ukraine, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3365.44s)]
*  it's like the the talking points, they've all just been abandoned. Like, no one's even arguing [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3375.52s)]
*  the stuff that they were arguing a couple years ago. I just totally brain farted. I had a specific [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3380.88s)]
*  one in mind. Maybe it'll come back to me. But it's just it's like the way these things always go. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3386.7200000000003s)]
*  It's the way they always go. And the whole time, the cheerleaders are like, oh, it's you know, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3394.32s)]
*  this is how it's gonna go. They give you the picture. You know, how many times did Biden and [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3398.8s)]
*  his his surrogates tell us that Ukraine was going to win and that they were and it was all bullshit [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3404.08s)]
*  the entire time. Anyway, the point I was making was that, yeah, here was the example, I got it back [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3408.72s)]
*  was that I just remember this was the most popular talking point at the beginning of the war, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3414.24s)]
*  that Ukrainians want to fight. They want to fight. Believe me, they want to fight this war. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3419.2s)]
*  And I would always just because it's the most basic libertarian insight of all, I'd be like, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3426.72s)]
*  well, why are they fighting with a conscripted army? You know, like if they want to fight so much, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3430.56s)]
*  how come there's I mean, this is like very basic, like if I put a gun to your head, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3435.9199999999996s)]
*  and I say like, come come with me, we're going for a drive. And then I say to everybody else, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3440.24s)]
*  no, he really wants to come for a drive with me. It's like, okay, well, in that case, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3445.2s)]
*  put the gun down. And we'll figure out if he really wants to come or not. The Ukrainians there, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3450.56s)]
*  I think they was the number I think there was over 100,000 people who were charged with desertion. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3455.68s)]
*  You know, it's like, oh, but they didn't seem to want to fight, you know, and those are the [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3462.64s)]
*  ones who did it despite it being illegal. Make it legal. Make it legal. Tomorrow, we'll find out [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3466.96s)]
*  how bad Ukrainians want to fight. You know, it's real. Isn't it something isn't there something so [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3472.24s)]
*  goddamn hilarious about the the West writing a blank check to Ukraine, pouring in hundreds of [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3475.8399999999997s)]
*  billions of dollars, and the country drafting them and forcing them to fight. And then you go, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3483.12s)]
*  no, these people want to fight. You're like, do they? Do they really? I don't know about that. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3489.12s)]
*  Anyway, all these guys, they got hundreds of thousands of people killed, and they have [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3495.68s)]
*  absolutely nothing to show for it. Nothing. It's really tragic. Hopefully, there, you know, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3499.6s)]
*  there's a piece can be worked out soon. And at least the killing will stop as Donald Trump said, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3507.44s)]
*  And just to speak to the stupidity of the Biden administration, the whole idea was, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3513.6s)]
*  we need to enforce country lines, because if not, we showcase American weakness, and we live in a [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3519.04s)]
*  more unjust world. So I guess our inability to do so now proves that to be true. And that's on the [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3525.6s)]
*  Biden administration. Yep. No, that's right. And then always with, you know, references to World [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3532.3199999999997s)]
*  War Two, as is always the case, you know, and then that, by the way, that's where I lost the [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3540.32s)]
*  general. He was agreeing with me about the Russia ship. But then it came to Gaza, you know, and I [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3544.4s)]
*  was talking about how horrible it is. And he was like, Well, I mean, after, you know, we killed a [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3549.76s)]
*  lot of people in World War Two, it's like, that's always what they go to. But it's, you know, all [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3553.04s)]
*  this stuff about how he's going to move on Poland, and he's gonna, he's going to reconstitute the [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3559.36s)]
*  Soviet Union, it's just all total bullshit, just completely made up. And that's the other thing, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3564.48s)]
*  which is, you know, Glenn Greenwald, actually with Dan Crenshaw, I don't know if you saw that they [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3571.12s)]
*  debated on Pierce Morgan, the other day. But, you know, he called him out on it was so great. And [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3575.04s)]
*  Crenshaw just had nothing to say to it. But he goes, because Crenshaw does the thing that they [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3581.36s)]
*  always do, where they go, he says the thing goes Russia is a third rate country, you know, a gas [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3585.28s)]
*  station with nukes or whatever they always call them. And then Glenn Greenwald goes like, Okay, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3591.36s)]
*  well, I mean, which one is it? You know, is it as puny little weak country? Or is he about to [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3596.32s)]
*  reconstitute the Soviet Union and take over half of Europe? Because it's I just don't know. Look, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3603.6800000000003s)]
*  one of the major things that did come out of this war is if you remember back, there was a it was in [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3608.6400000000003s)]
*  one of the Bill Burns memos, I don't think it was the yet means yet one, I think it was one of the [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3615.1200000000003s)]
*  other ones that got that got leaked. But Vladimir Putin had said his famous line was I could be in [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3619.6s)]
*  Kiev in a week. You know, like he was and I think this was and in fact, Scott's got it in the book, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3626.24s)]
*  I can't remember it off the top of my head. But there were like, colonels in the military, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3632.48s)]
*  who were already talking about an insurgency in the first month of the war, when Vladimir Putin [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3638.4s)]
*  first invaded. So they were talking about us backing an insurgency. In other words, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3645.04s)]
*  they expected Ukraine to fall. And then it would just be an insurgency that was fighting against [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3650.16s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. That didn't end up happening. Ukraine did much better in this war than I would [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3655.52s)]
*  have predicted they would have done. Now, of course, that is very related to the fact that [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3661.2s)]
*  they had a blank check from the entire Western world. I mean, that that Vladimir Putin quite [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3667.2799999999997s)]
*  possibly would have been right. Absent the hundreds of billions of dollars that poured in [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3672.08s)]
*  from the West, right? Like if it was just a one on one fight, maybe he would have been in Kiev in a [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3678.16s)]
*  week. Also, the fact that from 2014 to 2022, NATO was doing joint military exercises with the [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3682.16s)]
*  Ukrainian military, and perhaps that got them a little bit in better shape. But regardless of that, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3691.7599999999998s)]
*  I just don't even know how anybody like how does this talking point even work anymore? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3698.0s)]
*  He couldn't even like he fought for years in Ukraine and was able to take some pieces of the [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3703.52s)]
*  thing, but not even control the entire country. Where do you get from that, that then he's going [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3709.76s)]
*  to launch a war with Poland and take on all of NATO? Now, I don't want to give Putin too much [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3714.8s)]
*  credit here. And maybe this is just my lack of actual foreign policy information. It's a little [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3720.08s)]
*  bit unclear if it was more of a siege than it was. No, look, that's a fair point, too. It's not [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3726.0s)]
*  clear that the Russians wanted to take all of Ukraine. So that's a fair point to make as well. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3732.16s)]
*  But regardless, they still have fought and lost a lot of people. And this has not been an easy war [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3737.76s)]
*  for them. The idea that they're reconstituting the Soviet Union is just this is a this is like a [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3742.88s)]
*  neocon wet dream of this being a real threat. So we're justified to fight this war. All [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3748.72s)]
*  bullshit. All right. We got to wrap up there. Thank you guys very much. As always for listening [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3755.44s)]
*  comic Dave Smith calm. Go check out run your mouth if you have not already Rob's other fantastic [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3760.0s)]
*  podcast. Anything else you want to plug Rob? Sorry, it's coming soon. I got to actually take [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3764.64s)]
*  some Adderall and get that done. But shoot me emails, Rob's newsroom at gmail.com. If I haven't [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3770.32s)]
*  responded yet, it's because I haven't taken my Adderall. Shoot Rob an email, maybe even shoot [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3774.88s)]
*  him an Adderall. Okay, the other thing I wanted to mention I forgot to mention before is that Natalie [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHEpm1rCcBo&t=3779.12s)]
