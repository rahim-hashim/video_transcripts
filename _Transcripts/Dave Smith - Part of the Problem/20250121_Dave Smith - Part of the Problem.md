# Dave Smith | Trump's First Full Day | Part Of The Problem 1221
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g)
*  What's up, what's up everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=9.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  He is Robbie the fire. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=12.42s)]
*  Bernstein. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=13.96s)]
*  He did make it back in one piece from, from, from Bozeman forever. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=14.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=19.16s)]
*  I got rerouted to Washington. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=20.16s)]
*  I had to sit there all day. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=21.88s)]
*  It was a, it was a full day's journey. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=23.04s)]
*  So I, you stayed a day longer than me. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=25.52s)]
*  I thought I was going to be screwed because there was a big snowstorm here on the East [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=29.08s)]
*  coast when I was flying back. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=32.64s)]
*  I ended up making it with no problems. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=34.32s)]
*  Other than I will say it was got to be up there with the worst weather that I ever landed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=37.32s)]
*  And when I drove to the airport, I had to fill up the car because I had a rental. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=44.32s)]
*  It was minus 15. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=48.44s)]
*  I woke up at 3 45 in the morning, filled up a car at minus 15 for the flight to be delayed [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=51.76s)]
*  anyways. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=56.28s)]
*  Those bastards. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=57.28s)]
*  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to hear this in the middle of the episode yelling [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=58.52s)]
*  about airlines, dude, it was a, it was like negative six or seven degrees here at my house [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=59.52s)]
*  this morning. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=64.56s)]
*  And it is, I was talking, it's funny too, cause we were just in Bozeman and now we come [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=65.56s)]
*  back to colder weather. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  There's, I had a few people tell me while we were out there that this was like the coldest [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=72.4s)]
*  weekend in Montana, like in eight months or something like that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=75.88s)]
*  And then come back and it's colder, but man, there is something. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=80.64s)]
*  So it is funny where it's like, you know, when it's like 32 degrees out or something [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=84.62s)]
*  and it's right around the freezing point and you're like, okay, that's a cold day. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  That's a day when you're going to need like a jacket and you're going to need like, and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=91.92s)]
*  then you get to like 20 degrees or in the teens and it's like, oh, you really feel it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  What is that? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  But there is something about like, I was just bringing my trash out this morning and there's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  something about when it's like negative seven degrees where it's just, it's like the cold [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  is yelling at you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  Like it just feels like, like you just, you walk outside and it's like the cold is mad [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=110.84s)]
*  at you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=114.76s)]
*  You're like, all right, cold. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=115.76s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  It was that type of day here today. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  I had this thought because I got into New York. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=121.0s)]
*  I left Montana was negative 15 in the morning and then I got outside in New York and it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=123.2s)]
*  was 22 and 22 is cold, but I'm like, this is this, this feels nice. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=127.48s)]
*  And then I realized, I know that this is retarded, but the difference between when it's 60 degrees [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=132.52s)]
*  outside and 30 degrees and that's a huge difference. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  60 is a beautiful day and 30 is like, oh, it's winter. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=140.72s)]
*  That's what I experienced from 22 to negative 15. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=143.84s)]
*  And that's wild to think about that you could be that variance of just cold. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like that you could be in a day where it is literally freezing cold outside and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=152.08s)]
*  then go now let's now let's make that summer. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=158.04s)]
*  Let's let's let's turn that into summer relative to whatever. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=162.0s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, it was a quick though. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=165.68s)]
*  I could, I could do more time in Montana. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'll tell you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=169.6s)]
*  I'm kind of the same way. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=172.72s)]
*  I could get used to the cold. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=173.72s)]
*  I get used. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=174.72s)]
*  That's our Jew superpower. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=175.72s)]
*  We can blend in anywhere. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  We can shape shift and fit our environment. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  You leave us out there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=181.16s)]
*  We'll just be a couple of ranchers within a few months. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=182.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=184.55999999999997s)]
*  But a couple of just points of business before we, we get started. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=185.55999999999997s)]
*  Me and you, Rob, we're going to be on the road. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  Fun ones coming up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=196.64s)]
*  Party towns. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=197.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=198.72s)]
*  I'm really looking forward to this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=199.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=200.88s)]
*  That's the next one. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=201.88s)]
*  One night only Louisville, Kentucky. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=203.24s)]
*  And then the following two days will be out in Fort Wayne, Indiana. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=205.92s)]
*  And then a week later, and this is just for you, Rob, because of all this negative degree [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=209.64s)]
*  talk, Key West, Key West, Florida, where I am, I'm told by reliable sources that I can [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=217.24s)]
*  be very confident it will not be negative 14 degrees in Key West. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=224.76s)]
*  Or if it is, we got bigger problems if it is. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=228.88s)]
*  So anyway, comicdavesmith.com for all of those ticket links. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=231.16s)]
*  Come out and see me and Robbie the fire. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=235.64s)]
*  Bernstein live. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=237.88s)]
*  The live shows are a lot of fun. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=239.24s)]
*  Bozeman was just great. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=240.4s)]
*  Really, really appreciate everybody who came out and filled up that theater for us. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=241.88s)]
*  It was a lot of fun. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=245.48s)]
*  And then the other one, which I did, I think I announced the details of the last show, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=247.28s)]
*  but this is official now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=252.88s)]
*  I will be participating in an Oxford style debate against Josh Hammer, who was a senior [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=255.48s)]
*  editor at Newsweek. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=266.76s)]
*  I believe he still is. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=268.24s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=270.2s)]
*  But for a long time, he was senior editor over at Newsweek. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=271.2s)]
*  I will be debating him. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=273.52s)]
*  The resolution is about the US Israel alliance. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=274.52s)]
*  So it's going to be a debate about the role that the relationship with Israel plays on [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=280.44s)]
*  US foreign policy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=290.32s)]
*  So a little bit different than previous Israel Palestine debates that I've done in the past. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=291.44s)]
*  But we will be doing that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=295.96s)]
*  It will be at Princeton University on February 11th. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=296.96s)]
*  Tickets to that are available now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=303.08s)]
*  So if you would like to come, if you go search on Twitter, I tweeted the link out. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=305.56s)]
*  So yeah, anyway, looking forward to that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  I know people really enjoy the debates. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=316.04s)]
*  So I think people will enjoy this one. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=318.64s)]
*  And it's a thank you to, I'm sorry, I should say the Steamboat Institute is the ones who [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=321.12s)]
*  are putting on the debate. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=325.96s)]
*  So thanks to those guys. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=328.2s)]
*  Should be a fun time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=329.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=330.92s)]
*  So Donald Trump is president. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=333.08s)]
*  Did you think it would happen? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=336.2s)]
*  Well, it has. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=337.8s)]
*  It is here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=339.52s)]
*  We are in the first full day of Donald Trump being president of the United States once [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  again. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=346.76s)]
*  It's been, yesterday was quite a show, if nothing else. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=347.76s)]
*  I did an episode, you were out for this one, Rob, or evidently you were somewhere between [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=352.52s)]
*  Montana and Washington DC. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=357.32s)]
*  Well, we were recording it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=359.08s)]
*  So I will ask, what are you, any thoughts on the inauguration and the first night we [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=360.36s)]
*  could get into some of these executive orders, but more just like your broad thoughts, how [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  are you feeling about all this? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, now that there's only two genders again, I'm not sure what bathroom I'm supposed to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=371.56s)]
*  use. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=375.44s)]
*  It is a whole different world. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=376.44s)]
*  We're back to two genders. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=379.76s)]
*  It's probably the biggest impact on my life. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  And I'm still going to have to give some consideration to that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=384.04s)]
*  I thought it was fun, American hurrah showing up saying, we're going to be awesome again. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=387.44s)]
*  Sitting there just signing the executive orders like there were bottles of wine that he was [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=393.08s)]
*  checking out like, oh, this is a nice one. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=396.44s)]
*  I love that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=398.44s)]
*  I liked the two gender talk. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=400.68s)]
*  I like most. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=402.24s)]
*  I love, this was my favorite thing. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=403.24s)]
*  They got the January six people out of jail on day one. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=406.08000000000004s)]
*  I think that that was, and just to see the massive flip in power of like what just what [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=409.12s)]
*  happened over the last four years that the Democrats use the entire system to go after [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  those people and try and make it seem like Donald Trump can't run for office again. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=422.0s)]
*  And we've got a problem with domestic terrorists and the whole ESG score racket and just advanced [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  socialism. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=431.72s)]
*  And we just rebuke the entire thing all the way down to those people are coming out of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=432.92s)]
*  jail. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  That was my favorite part. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=437.65999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  Just, I think like that can't be overstated enough. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=439.65999999999997s)]
*  And you know, it's not just, it's not even just that the thing was like rebuked. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=443.7s)]
*  It's it's as you said, it's a complete reversal to the point where it's just, I think to so [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=450.14s)]
*  many people, it's just kind of look, the whole issue with the whole deal with January 6th [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=456.5s)]
*  and what they what the corporate media called for four years, the big lie that Trump denied [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=463.62s)]
*  that he had lost the election in 2020 and that this, you know, this is what was the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=469.98s)]
*  impetus for the whole, you know, end of democracy. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=474.14000000000004s)]
*  If Donald Trump wins. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=477.70000000000005s)]
*  And meanwhile, the people who were screeching about democracy every day for the last four [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=478.82000000000005s)]
*  years, they tried to have the presidential candidate who won removed from the ballot. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=485.86s)]
*  They literally quite literally tried to remove the guy who ended up winning. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  It's just, I mean, it speaks for itself. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=500.38s)]
*  But I completely agree with you that, you know, there's if you think about it, even [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=502.78s)]
*  like any any of the January 6th people who were still in prison at this point, these [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=507.94s)]
*  people have done years already at this point. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=515.2600000000001s)]
*  And I'm sorry, I just don't think I don't think there's any crime that was committed, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=517.74s)]
*  like the worst of the January 6th. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=521.82s)]
*  I don't see how any of them deserve more punishment than this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, like what what do you want to do to people here? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=529.58s)]
*  I mean, you can you can commit heinous violent crimes and be out in four years. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=532.5400000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=540.22s)]
*  It's just like, I'm sorry, breaking a window at the Capitol building or even tussling with [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  police or something like that just shouldn't carry this long of a prison sentence. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=545.5s)]
*  It's an outrage. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=550.7s)]
*  But there's something really remarkable to the extent that the Democrats will lie and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=551.7s)]
*  then use power to try and enforce the reality upon you. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=556.98s)]
*  And so I'm sure you I'm sure you just spoke about on the episode of First Came Out This [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=560.76s)]
*  Morning, so I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=564.34s)]
*  The pardons that Biden gave on the way out. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=567.5s)]
*  And let's start with the pardons that he gave to the January 6th committee. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=571.02s)]
*  We'll get to Fauci next. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=574.54s)]
*  But the pardons he gave to the January 6th committee and to his family saying that because [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=575.6999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to defy conventions and be the first one to go after him. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=580.14s)]
*  And we know that that's not reality. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=584.5s)]
*  We know that Joe Biden broke the conventions of going after political opponents to try [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=586.3s)]
*  and keep them out of office. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=590.9399999999999s)]
*  He was concerned about retribution. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=592.9s)]
*  Is that me or sorry, sorry. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=594.54s)]
*  On my end, you froze up for a second there, but you came right back. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=597.5799999999999s)]
*  So I'm sorry. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=599.8199999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=600.8199999999999s)]
*  It was only the most brilliant thing I ever said, Dave. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=601.8199999999999s)]
*  And you missed it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=602.8199999999999s)]
*  You were saying that Biden obviously is the one who broke those precedents. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=607.3399999999999s)]
*  And then it's not just that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=612.38s)]
*  But if you look at the January 6th committee, they tried to make theater out of what happened [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=613.38s)]
*  to make it seem like Donald Trump can't run for office again. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=617.3399999999999s)]
*  And they tried to force that down the American people's throats. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=620.9000000000001s)]
*  And then because they covered it up by getting rid of the records and what Liz Cheney was [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=624.58s)]
*  already busted for talking directly to a witness. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=630.4200000000001s)]
*  And now they have to also once again by force make it that they can't be prosecuted. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=634.62s)]
*  So I just think and that's what they did with the January 6th narrative was they were trying [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=640.5s)]
*  to sell it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=645.3800000000001s)]
*  So they took everyone who was involved and they rounded them up. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=646.3800000000001s)]
*  They didn't do that for any of the other riots. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=649.1400000000001s)]
*  That were going on through those years. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=650.78s)]
*  So it's just so incredible to me, I guess, the extent by which the Democrats are willing [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=653.18s)]
*  to wield force to try and make their narrative true. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=658.6999999999999s)]
*  It's what they did in censoring the Internet. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=663.5s)]
*  And it just seems like we've so cleansed that out of the system where even they had to show [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=666.5s)]
*  up. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=671.38s)]
*  You had Clinton there. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=672.38s)]
*  You had Obama. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=673.38s)]
*  Someone lip read that he made the joke afterwards. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=674.38s)]
*  Hey, is there any way that we can stop this? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=675.74s)]
*  None of those guys want to be there. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=677.8199999999999s)]
*  They just know at this point they have to show up. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=679.4200000000001s)]
*  And it does seem like a great celebration of cleansing really the worst parts that we've [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=681.58s)]
*  seen from our government for the last 20 years. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=686.66s)]
*  Well it's hard. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=689.78s)]
*  Like it's kind of hard to truly appreciate how remarkable that yesterday was. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=690.78s)]
*  And the two things that are really, you know, like we talk about this a lot on the show, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=701.66s)]
*  but it's one of the more difficult challenges of doing this, of doing what we do, is that [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=706.86s)]
*  when you're in this period of time and like particularly the last four years, although [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=712.82s)]
*  it's been true for the last eight years, but really like COVID and everything since then, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=718.78s)]
*  it's like when so many crazy things are happening, you end up getting sucked into talking about [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=725.22s)]
*  the news of the day. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=734.78s)]
*  And it becomes more of a challenge. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=736.74s)]
*  It's something we I think focus on on this show. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=738.98s)]
*  I think it's one of the things, by the way, that kind of separates us from a lot of the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=740.9399999999999s)]
*  other shows that talk about the news of the day. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=743.9s)]
*  But you try when it makes sense to like, you know, zoom out and put things in the proper [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=746.4599999999999s)]
*  context and go like, hey, what's the bigger picture here? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=752.98s)]
*  And like even when things are really crazy all the time, one thing could be so crazy [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=755.66s)]
*  that you're like, whoa, this is really quite a line that we've just crossed. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=761.0200000000001s)]
*  But applying that to yesterday. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=764.74s)]
*  So yesterday starts early in the morning, Joe Biden has all these pardons and then Donald [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=768.7800000000001s)]
*  Trump, the day ends with Donald Trump, you know, signing all of these executive orders [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=773.5s)]
*  and pardons. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=777.3000000000001s)]
*  And if you just try to zoom out for a second and think about this, okay, number one, while [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=778.8800000000001s)]
*  it's true that since the elections in November, the rhetoric against Donald Trump has kind [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=787.46s)]
*  of dried up. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=793.9000000000001s)]
*  And while you have some people who are still saying loony things and, you know, like some [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=795.62s)]
*  of this still continues. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=802.02s)]
*  But for the most part, like he's not being called a Nazi every day. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=803.38s)]
*  Everyone's acting as if democracy isn't over. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=807.14s)]
*  They're assuming there's going to be more elections in the future. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=810.02s)]
*  That bluff has kind of been called on our last episode together, Rob, where we talked [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=812.82s)]
*  about Joe Biden's farewell address. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=816.74s)]
*  This was one of the points we made a lot, that there's this weird contradiction between [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=818.5s)]
*  like everything you just said and now sitting here saying the country's in a great place [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=821.58s)]
*  and I did such a great job. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=825.78s)]
*  There's this weird friction that kind of can't be ignored. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=827.66s)]
*  But for Joe Biden, while he's saying all that kind of nice stuff, for him to issue these [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=831.4s)]
*  pardons, there's okay, obviously, me and you could look at this and say, well, clearly, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=836.1s)]
*  crimes and he's just trying to get ahead of, you know, if the Trump administration should [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=843.38s)]
*  want to look into them. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=847.78s)]
*  You get now that's still obviously the correct answer. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=849.26s)]
*  But even if we were to like steel man Joe Biden's position, the most you could steel [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=852.1s)]
*  man it what he's saying from his perspective would be that none of these people committed [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=857.3s)]
*  crimes. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=864.58s)]
*  However, he can't trust that the new administration is not going to seize complete control of [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=865.82s)]
*  the Justice Department and evidently the court system and go after these people who are not [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=873.6600000000001s)]
*  criminal. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=879.0200000000001s)]
*  Like in other words, it's either an admission that they're guilty of crimes or it's an [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=880.0200000000001s)]
*  admission that you really do fear that some form of fascism has taken over this country. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=884.9000000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=890.82s)]
*  Like that's the only other answer. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=891.82s)]
*  And I think that's the best thing if we're going to be as charitable as we could possibly [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=892.82s)]
*  be to that argument, then that's what you're saying. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=896.2600000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=899.7800000000001s)]
*  And so for the outgoing president to send that message, which again is the best case [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=900.7800000000001s)]
*  scenario for him that we could get into this argument a little bit because it's obviously [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=905.94s)]
*  the prior not the latter. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=909.82s)]
*  But like that would be the best that the establishment, you know, Democrats could argue that the corporate [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=911.6600000000001s)]
*  media pundits. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=919.22s)]
*  That's the best they could argue is that no, no, no, none of these people are actually [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=920.3s)]
*  guilty of crimes, but Donald Trump is such a mad man that he might try to imprison him [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=923.54s)]
*  anyway. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=927.66s)]
*  And then you had Donald Trump in his inauguration speech saying that America has been liberated [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=929.26s)]
*  today. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=938.54s)]
*  And all I'm saying here, forget what your politics or your views are. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=940.18s)]
*  Those are just like unprecedented things in the United States of America. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=945.98s)]
*  That is truly a moment in American history. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=951.7s)]
*  That doesn't happen. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=954.98s)]
*  Like lots of things happen in America. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=956.82s)]
*  We got a lot of problems and we got a lot of things. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=958.98s)]
*  Our government's done a lot of evil things are, you know what I mean? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=961.1s)]
*  Like there's, but this is new. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=965.02s)]
*  This is not something that ever happened in the United States of America. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=967.2s)]
*  No presidents ever use the language like you're liberated. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=969.98s)]
*  This is what we would talk about when like the communists fell or like if a dictator [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=974.2s)]
*  was deposed in a third world country, but the people have been liberated. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=978.48s)]
*  And so you have on both sides, you have, you have Joe Biden implicitly saying that like, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=982.72s)]
*  no, this guy is a fascist and we'll go after people even if they're not criminals. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=988.12s)]
*  And then you have Biden essentially saying that you've been liberated from this oligarchy [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=992.96s)]
*  that's been running the country. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=998.26s)]
*  Huh? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1000.2s)]
*  Trump saying you've been liberated. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1001.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1002.48s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1003.48s)]
*  I, my mistake. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1004.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1005.48s)]
*  Trump saying that you've been liberated from this oligarchy that is in itself, just, you [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1006.48s)]
*  know, when, whatever the quality is of me trying to have like an alarm that goes off [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1010.88s)]
*  when something is like, Oh, zoom out and actually appreciate that this is a pretty big deal. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1016.16s)]
*  That, that gets my spidey senses going. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1021.28s)]
*  That's like, wow, this is something different that we've entered into here. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1024.0s)]
*  And that in itself is very interesting. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1028.88s)]

*  Anyway, I don't know if you have any thoughts on that, Rob, but or we could get into the [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1108.68s)]
*  like obviously the part of the work because they're criminals. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1114.08s)]
*  I think the Democrats really went further than what I've seen in my lifetime of running [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1117.48s)]
*  an authoritarian regime. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1123.64s)]
*  The amount of money that they put into green energy reforms and money that they put into [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1125.6000000000001s)]
*  censoring the Internet, pushing of what the covid was, bringing people across the border, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1130.54s)]
*  these foreign wars that people don't want. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1136.3200000000002s)]
*  But really, I would say the biggest ones are kind of the full scale socialism of trying [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1138.54s)]
*  to push a green energy initiative and also the diversity, blah, blah, blah. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1142.88s)]
*  But it's just money from the Fed, you know, creating incentives for things that wouldn't [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1149.68s)]
*  exist in the market and to kind of police and control their narrative and then policing [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1153.24s)]
*  the Internet and then trying to get the other political candidate assassinated, in my opinion, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1159.4s)]
*  or just trying to keep them off the ballots through the court system. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1166.1200000000001s)]
*  So not saying that, you know, Trump's going to be great. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1169.4s)]
*  I think he's going to spend as much as anyone's ever spent. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1173.4s)]
*  And, you know, we'll see what we'll see what actually comes of the wars and some of the [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1176.2s)]
*  other things. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1179.72s)]
*  But I don't think it's I think it's a wild amount of authoritarianism that we've been [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1180.3200000000002s)]
*  living under with the Biden regime. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1185.88s)]
*  And so I don't think Trump is lying when he's like, we're going back to freedom and we're [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1188.48s)]
*  going back to pursuing greatness. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1193.44s)]
*  Not going to stand around and shame all you all the time. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1195.2s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, there's OK, let me just because there's a few things that I wanted [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1198.24s)]
*  to say on this. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1203.4s)]
*  But number one, I should just make the because I was, you know, granting just for the sake [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1204.04s)]
*  of argument, like if you steal man Biden's position. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1207.68s)]
*  But the truth is that it is I think that it's seen look like imagine, if you will, that [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1210.16s)]
*  I am in a, you know, I'm in a position where for whatever reason I get like some no bid [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1221.84s)]
*  government contract or something like that and I get to pick who receives a billion dollars [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1226.76s)]
*  and I pick my wife. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1232.48s)]
*  And I go, that's that's and I argue that I go, she was, you know, I did all my research and [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1235.24s)]
*  she was the one who most deserved this billion dollars. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1241.0s)]
*  Now, I mean, I could have an argument for why that's the case that could even theoretically [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1244.4s)]
*  be the case, but nobody's going to believe that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1249.52s)]
*  You have to think that the second I do that, just everybody's view of that is going to be, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1253.24s)]
*  and rightfully so, is going to be like, no, dude, you found a way to give the billion [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1257.1999999999998s)]
*  dollars to yourself, you know, like you clearly this is corrupt. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1260.72s)]
*  Number one, number one with the pardons of Fauci and Liz Cheney and all these people, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1265.6399999999999s)]
*  that's the number one thing is that this is just totally going to be viewed as what it [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1270.9199999999998s)]
*  obviously is, which is that like, oh, yeah, all these people were criminals and you just [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1274.9199999999998s)]
*  gave them blanket pardons on your way out. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1280.92s)]
*  But to think for a second, right, if you think of the enormous amount of control that [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1284.2s)]
*  what we refer to as the Biden administration had over the managerial state and over the [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1292.2s)]
*  deep state. And again, it's not what I say we think of as the Biden administration, because [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1297.6s)]
*  we all know Joe Biden's not actually running the government and hasn't been. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1303.12s)]
*  But even with the level of control that, say, the deep state had, they were unable to get [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1307.6s)]
*  Donald Trump on any of these bullshit charges, right? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1314.28s)]
*  I mean, I guess they got some convictions, but they were unable to really do anything [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1317.1999999999998s)]
*  because it was just so obvious that none of this was real. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1320.3999999999999s)]
*  And it was just too, you know, it was like just too thin. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1323.4399999999998s)]
*  And for all the problems we have in America, we still do have like the rotting bones, the [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1326.3999999999999s)]
*  old collapsing structure of a republic. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1334.1999999999998s)]
*  Like there is still a court process and there's still juries and you get lawyers and you [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1338.3999999999999s)]
*  can appeal. And like there is somewhat of a process here. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1344.6s)]
*  And they so anyway, my point is like what who could buy that? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1347.56s)]
*  The real fear here is that Donald Trump is going to have such complete control of this [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1353.32s)]
*  that even though there are no crimes that Fauci and Liz Cheney or any of them have [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1359.52s)]
*  committed, he's still going to be able to get them charged, bring these charges to a [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1364.4s)]
*  court and get convictions and then win on in appeals courts or whatever. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1369.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like what it is so far fetched to argue that these people are [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1373.88s)]
*  innocent, they have committed no crimes and yet they still need these pardons. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1379.2s)]
*  Just think about what you're actually arguing there versus the obvious, much more easy [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1385.2s)]
*  answer, which is that, oh, yeah, they did commit all types of crimes. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1391.16s)]
*  And that's why you're pardoning them. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1394.8s)]
*  Now, given that that's the case, I think there's actually, you know, there's something [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1396.92s)]
*  about that that is kind of leads you to be optimistic because it's like, oh, Joe Biden [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1401.28s)]
*  or whoever Joe Biden's handlers are. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1407.28s)]
*  They were concerned enough that Donald Trump might actually try to bring charges against [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1409.44s)]
*  some of these people. And I kind of like that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1413.84s)]
*  That's that doesn't seem bad to me. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1417.24s)]
*  And, you know, I'll say this was another thought I had. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1419.6799999999998s)]
*  I was thinking this. So last night after we you know, I did the last episode yesterday [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1422.1999999999998s)]
*  during the afternoon. Last night I was watching, which I very, very rarely actually [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1427.6799999999998s)]
*  watch real television, but I was watching real television last night. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1434.1599999999999s)]
*  I was watching Donald Trump signing his pardons. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1438.56s)]
*  And. OK, one of the first things after the full day, like as I was reflecting on it last [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1445.28s)]
*  night, one of the first things that was just really apparent to me and I think a lot of [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1451.52s)]
*  people is not like a unique insight to me, but it was amazing just after the last four [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1458.04s)]
*  years to see Donald Trump off the cuff, going back and forth with journalists, doing [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1464.36s)]
*  his like little Trumpian thing, you know what I mean, where he's kind of arguing with [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1472.6s)]
*  them. He's doing this big showmanship thing. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1476.28s)]
*  People are asking him questions. He's giving his thoughts in real time in just such a like [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1478.48s)]
*  unguarded manner. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1482.6s)]
*  You know, just like the stuff you remember, you're like, oh, yeah, there's Donald Trump [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1484.6s)]
*  and he's back in that chair now. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1488.08s)]
*  It was. The juxtaposition of like earlier that day, Joe Biden had been president and [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1489.68s)]
*  now Donald Trump's president. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1496.04s)]
*  It was just hard to overstate that it's like, look, say whatever you want to. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1497.48s)]
*  We have a president again. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1501.1200000000001s)]
*  Like there there is actually somebody who sits in that chair who believes I'm the [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1504.3600000000001s)]
*  president of the United States of America. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1509.4s)]
*  And guess what? I have some thoughts like I have some feelings about some matters of [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1511.28s)]
*  policy and the fact that that even needs to be said, the fact that that's even a thing [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1518.08s)]
*  that it ever wasn't like that is so insane. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1524.44s)]
*  It's hard to overstate. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1528.2s)]
*  But and then also the maneuvers, almost all of them are things that I massively agree [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1529.44s)]
*  with. Getting us out of the hook, getting us out of the Paris Accords, saying we're [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1534.28s)]
*  not funding the Green New Deal anymore. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1537.64s)]
*  We're getting rid of Evie, like just all of it, like just the juxtaposition between [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1539.4s)]
*  him and the type of things that Biden were putting in and him going, no, we're going [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1545.0s)]
*  to be a free and prosperous country. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1548.52s)]
*  We're going to build that wall and we're going to start drilling for our own oil and [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1550.24s)]
*  we're not going to have other countries tell us how that we're supposed to treat [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1554.44s)]
*  pandemics. We're not going to participate in some phony U.N. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1557.8s)]
*  thing for reducing carbon, which makes no sense of China's not involved. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1561.32s)]
*  So, you know, the first day maneuvers talk about, hey, I'm going to take the yoke off [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1565.72s)]
*  the Americans and we're going to be great and go for freedom. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1569.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, it's not actually not lies, like we're so used to even hold. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1572.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes, even look, even the stupid stuff, right, like even the stuff that doesn't really [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1576.92s)]
*  do it for me, you know, renaming the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America, something [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1582.6000000000001s)]
*  like that, which I don't really care for that. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1586.68s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's just fries. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1589.28s)]
*  It's just what it's been called. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1590.64s)]
*  Leave it alone. Yes, it's freedom fries. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1591.88s)]
*  It's exactly what it is. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1594.52s)]
*  It's do it. I don't know. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1596.0s)]
*  It's for people who don't remember. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1597.0s)]
*  This was a really dumb thing that started in the George W. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1598.3999999999999s)]
*  Bush Republican Party. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1601.8s)]
*  I think it was actually. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1603.72s)]
*  Walter, what's his name, who came up with it anyway, but regardless, who ended up [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1606.72s)]
*  being wrong on the war and then being a really great guy about it afterward. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1611.56s)]
*  But this was like right post 9 11. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1614.56s)]
*  It was a big thing. We're not going to call them French fries anymore. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1617.08s)]
*  We're going to call them freedom fries. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1619.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, OK, it's like this just I don't know. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1622.72s)]
*  I just it's not my deal. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1626.2s)]
*  I find it to be kind of dumb tokens, symbol stuff. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1627.8s)]
*  But I will say there is something about it that kind of it jives [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1631.88s)]
*  with the broader point that you're making, that the symbol is like, hey, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1636.52s)]
*  we're going to try to be great. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1641.32s)]
*  And we're not going to sit here feeling guilty about everything. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1643.84s)]
*  And we're not you know what I mean? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1646.88s)]
*  Like we're not just going to accept that we're a collapsing empire. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1648.0s)]
*  And oh, my God, we did all these things wrong in the past. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1651.32s)]
*  And we should really feel bad about like it. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1654.1200000000001s)]
*  There is something about it that's kind of like reversing [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1655.96s)]
*  this cultural phenomenon that I kind of, you know, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1659.96s)]
*  think there's something positive in it. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1664.1200000000001s)]
*  And I will, you know, I actually wanted to read this because there was [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1666.4s)]
*  Darrell Cooper, who's of course, you guys, I'm sure all know. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1671.24s)]
*  He's been on the show and is just a brilliant historian [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1675.3600000000001s)]
*  and who kicked up a whole lot. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1680.52s)]
*  He had quite a little controversy this last year. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1682.48s)]
*  I also just love how Darrell's doing his full series on World War Two. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1686.4s)]
*  It's just so funny to me like this, like there's this controversy over it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1691.16s)]
*  And he's like, OK, all right. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1695.16s)]
*  Well, here comes 30 hours on it. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1696.68s)]
*  Anyway, by the way, the prologue was so good. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1699.2s)]
*  I listened to it a few days ago. Just so good. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1702.44s)]
*  I think the rest of the series is coming out in the next couple of months. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1705.56s)]
*  But he said this is what Darrell Cooper wrote this morning. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1707.96s)]
*  And I really liked this. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1711.64s)]
*  And he said, there is nothing more toxic in politics [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1712.8000000000002s)]
*  than someone who reflexively countersignals their own side [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1716.44s)]
*  whenever people become optimistic. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1720.1200000000001s)]
*  They're divisive agitators making a statement less about practical politics [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1722.4s)]
*  than about their own personality. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1727.0800000000002s)]
*  Just really liked that. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1729.88s)]
*  And I think there is you see a lot of that around, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1731.3200000000002s)]
*  certainly an issue within the libertarian world. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1735.88s)]
*  And, you know, that was another thought that I had all day yesterday. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1741.2s)]
*  And I think it's something that you've kind of touched on here, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1745.72s)]
*  that there's just kind of this feeling of like we're back [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1747.72s)]
*  and this is great and there are possibilities and maybe like [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1751.3999999999999s)]
*  things will be much better for this country going forward. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1755.3999999999999s)]
*  Now, we don't know for sure that that is going to come to fruition. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1758.36s)]
*  But there is something important about allowing people to have that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1763.2s)]
*  Like, hope is a very important thing. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1768.32s)]
*  So I remember I remember I talked about this with my speech [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1770.8s)]
*  and telling me that it's for the soul of America. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1774.2s)]
*  Yeah, really. You know? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1777.08s)]
*  So I remember that me and you definitely talked about this. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1779.04s)]
*  But I said this on Joe Rogan's podcast. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1784.12s)]
*  And when you say things on Joe Rogan's podcast, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1787.52s)]
*  it's now part of the historical record. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1789.8s)]
*  That's the way the new media works. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1792.0s)]
*  So I'm on record having said this back in 2020. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1793.84s)]
*  And so I don't know if you remember this, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1797.8799999999999s)]
*  but I did tell you this this story. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1800.08s)]
*  But so the day that Joe Biden like officially became president, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1801.6399999999999s)]
*  which, if you remember back in 2020, the election was contested. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1806.08s)]
*  It was this dragged on for a while. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1809.1599999999999s)]
*  So I don't remember exactly when it was that it was like officially announced [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1811.32s)]
*  that Joe Biden had won the race. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1815.72s)]
*  This isn't I'm not talking about the it wasn't January 6. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1817.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not talking about the votes being certified. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1820.04s)]
*  I'm just saying when like the media called that like because they didn't call it [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1821.76s)]
*  that night, there were several days until they did. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1825.36s)]
*  So I was in New York City. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1828.24s)]
*  Now, I had moved out of New York City earlier that year. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1830.44s)]
*  So I left New York City like immediately when the lockdown started [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1834.8400000000001s)]
*  or even actually a little before the lockdowns. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1838.16s)]
*  But so I hadn't lived in the city for now. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1841.52s)]
*  You know, this city, I've lived in my entire life. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1844.0800000000002s)]
*  This is four years ago. So I'm 37. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1846.64s)]
*  I've lived in the city my entire life. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1850.8000000000002s)]
*  And then I had just moved that year that we happened to be in the city. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1852.76s)]
*  We were doing an episode of Legion of Skanks in the daytime, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1856.24s)]
*  which I can't even remember why we were. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1859.9199999999998s)]
*  But it 100 percent was in the day in broad daylight. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1862.1999999999998s)]
*  I was at the stand. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1864.96s)]
*  And so I was like, I got there a little bit early [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1866.36s)]
*  and I walked around a little bit like just walking around Union Square. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1869.52s)]
*  And it's kind of hard to fully capture this [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1873.1999999999998s)]
*  for people who weren't like there during the time. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1879.0s)]
*  But look, New York City had this is November 2020. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1881.96s)]
*  New York City had had a rough year. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1887.52s)]
*  I mean, just a really rough year. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1889.6s)]
*  It was the lockdowns were devastating. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1891.24s)]
*  There was a sharp rise in crime and homelessness. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1893.68s)]
*  Businesses obviously had been destroyed. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1898.96s)]
*  Then there were the the riots that ended up getting a lot of the businesses [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1902.24s)]
*  who had somehow made it through the first few months of the lockdown. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1906.1599999999999s)]
*  And there was an energy in New York City that was really heartbreaking for me [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1910.0s)]
*  as somebody who's like, that's my hometown and I've lived there my whole life. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1914.9599999999998s)]
*  And 2020 was just a very rough year. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1918.76s)]
*  It was a rough year for the country, but particularly for big cities. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1920.6399999999999s)]
*  And New York City was was really one of the hardest hit cities. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1924.0s)]
*  Also, by the way, just the germ itself had been devastating to New York. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1928.28s)]
*  A lot of people died from Covid or many more with Covid. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1932.4399999999998s)]
*  But anyway, and there was just a positive vibe in the air [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1936.12s)]
*  when it was announced that Joe Biden had won. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1941.32s)]
*  People were celebrating. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1943.6s)]
*  Obviously, the city was overwhelmingly Democrat [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1944.8799999999999s)]
*  and overwhelmingly didn't like Donald Trump even more so back then than now. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1948.92s)]
*  And people were just happy. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1953.76s)]
*  They were celebrating. People had noisemakers. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1956.2s)]
*  There was just like a feeling of optimism. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1958.52s)]
*  There was a feeling of like whatever this craziness of the last four years has been. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1960.68s)]
*  It's over now. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1966.08s)]
*  And now something positive maybe comes next. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1967.3999999999999s)]
*  Now, I unfortunately have known. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1970.72s)]
*  I just know a lot more about Joe Biden than the average person does. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1974.44s)]
*  I pay attention to politics a lot more than the average person does. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1977.8s)]
*  Now I was 100 percent convinced. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1980.3999999999999s)]
*  That Biden was going to be a disaster, you know that. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1984.12s)]
*  I mean, it was not not Nostradamus here. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1987.04s)]
*  I'm not giving myself credit for like the most insightful prediction ever. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1989.76s)]
*  It was a pretty easy one to make. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1992.72s)]
*  But I knew this was going to be a disaster. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1994.12s)]
*  But I remember saying and I said this to Rogan, I said this to you, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1996.6399999999999s)]
*  that on in that moment, like you'd have to be some type of asshole to not kind of be like, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=1999.52s)]
*  all right, let them have their day, you know, like let them have their moment of belief. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2006.76s)]
*  What am I going to do? Go around and try to rob people of their joy. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2011.72s)]
*  That's never who you want to be in this world. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2014.96s)]
*  And like I did just I had this feeling back then that it was like [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2017.1999999999998s)]
*  as much as it was not my side that had won, just being like, you know what, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2021.44s)]
*  this is still my city and these people are still my people. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2026.52s)]
*  And like they've had a really rough year. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2030.2s)]
*  I'm really glad they're having a day where they feel decent. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2033.52s)]
*  It's a shame they're going to figure out that none of this is going to actually, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2036.68s)]
*  you know, work, but it was just kind of like it was nice. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2040.16s)]
*  I remember the feeling it was nice. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2044.36s)]
*  And you'd hope that like people could at least appreciate that, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2046.08s)]
*  that like especially for for Trump supporters. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2050.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't I think there's a lot of people who maybe don't. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2056.48s)]
*  Fully appreciate how rough things have been for these guys for quite a while, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2061.48s)]
*  how much they've just been down and kicked while they're down and then taunted [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2068.16s)]
*  and called names and told they're Nazis and bigots and all of these things, you know, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2073.52s)]
*  and like for them to have this moment now where they feel that way. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2079.04s)]
*  I just do think there's something beautiful about that. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2082.7200000000003s)]
*  And yes, it is true that Donald Trump probably is not quite as great as they [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2085.32s)]
*  think he is. And there will be problems with this next administration. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2090.48s)]
*  And there's there's all there's a lot of bad people in the cabinet and there's a [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2094.0s)]
*  lot of bad policy ideas floating around. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2097.7200000000003s)]
*  But like. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2099.92s)]
*  I just don't think I think it's good when people have hope. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2102.76s)]
*  I think optimism is good. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2106.04s)]
*  Pessimism is bad. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2107.88s)]
*  Maybe that's a little simplistic, but I do think that's the case. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2109.4s)]
*  And it's I don't know. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2112.2s)]
*  It's nice to see your fellow Americans being hopeful for the country. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2114.8s)]
*  And then to your point, look like. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2118.84s)]
*  At least with Donald Trump, it's a mixed bag. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2122.84s)]
*  I mean, with Joe Biden, it was just all bad. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2125.88s)]
*  And so at least with Donald Trump, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2129.08s)]
*  there are some things you could point to to go like, oh, this is he's taking a step [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2131.08s)]
*  here that might actually really improve things. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2135.2s)]
*  I mean, I got to say, I think. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2137.96s)]
*  And maybe I shouldn't speak on this because I got to, like, actually go look [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2140.4399999999996s)]
*  at a comprehensive list and look through all of the executive orders and stuff. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2144.56s)]
*  But like. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2148.64s)]
*  I think designating the cartels as terrorists was like the only thing that I [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2150.12s)]
*  saw that I was like, oh, that's really bad, that like that's or at least has the [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2155.72s)]
*  potential to be really bad. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2160.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know if there was anything else [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2162.0s)]
*  that I would really object to so far seem like that was the one. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2163.56s)]
*  You're you're muted. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2170.08s)]
*  The other one a little while back, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2173.2799999999997s)]
*  the other one that that was contentious was getting rid of birthright citizenship [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2175.4s)]
*  where I like I said, I don't really even disagree with it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2182.0s)]
*  I think that should be the great amnesty is second class citizenship and people [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2185.12s)]
*  can stay, but they're not allowed to leech off the system. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2189.32s)]
*  I think that that's the most practical solution to not having to deport [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2192.08s)]
*  a lot of individuals or changing the voting demographic. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2196.76s)]
*  So I'm not saying I disagree with with Donald Trump for for that. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2199.6800000000003s)]
*  However, it seemingly is against, I think, the Constitution. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2204.88s)]
*  So that will probably go to the Supreme Court. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2208.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the issue of that is going to be the legality of it. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2211.44s)]
*  And yeah, the president can't just amend [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2214.48s)]
*  the Constitution through executive order. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2216.52s)]
*  And so we'll have to see what the courts ultimately decide of that. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2218.4s)]
*  No, but I just you know, to me, it was like if you. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2222.0s)]
*  Though the one that jumped out to me is like, oh, this is really bad, was the [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2225.52s)]
*  designating the cartels as terrorists, and it's a little bit tricky [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2230.28s)]
*  to make this argument, because of course, there's like the social psychology of it. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2234.44s)]
*  And the fact that people do just we're all this way, you know, we're we're animals [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2239.4s)]
*  and we have our first base reaction to things. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2243.64s)]
*  So like, if you say this, it's like they were like, well, what are you saying? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2245.88s)]
*  What are you saying that the drug cartels [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2249.56s)]
*  aren't the bad guys or that, you know, they're like, look at MS-13, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2251.48s)]
*  look how scary and tatted up they are. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2254.96s)]
*  And they did all these bad things. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2256.6400000000003s)]
*  So but the the real point is that it's like, look. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2258.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, it strikes me as a legal distinction because look at what we're [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2261.92s)]
*  willing to do once people are labeled as terrorists. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2265.6400000000003s)]
*  And it kind of speaks to what I was talking about with the way the Democrats [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2268.32s)]
*  were wielding power, it's like all of a sudden out in Syria, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2270.76s)]
*  that's not a terrorist organization. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2273.48s)]
*  So the terrorist organization is almost like the FDA safe and effective. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2275.48s)]
*  Oh, well, the FDA labeled it safe and effective. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2279.88s)]
*  That means it's something that I have to take and I can't question. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2281.88s)]
*  There's a similar thing with terrorist [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2285.8s)]
*  designations that, oh, that now means you might be able to what are we going to be [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2287.8s)]
*  running operations now in South America? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2291.36s)]
*  Are we expanding operations in South America? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2293.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Are we taking out the cartel so that someone else can pick up that drug [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2295.36s)]
*  business, CIA getting back into it? Yes. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2298.6400000000003s)]
*  By the way, also, the Biden administration [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2301.0800000000004s)]
*  made a real effort to deem you Trump supporter as a terrorist. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2303.16s)]
*  So, you know, keep that in mind. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2308.0s)]
*  But look, I mean, I think I could make [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2309.7999999999997s)]
*  and I'm not saying this is conclusive, but I could make a very strong, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2312.52s)]
*  very compelling argument that the war on drugs and the war on terrorism [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2317.56s)]
*  have been the most disastrous policies in modern American history. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2324.52s)]
*  Like that the that the war on drugs is [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2328.04s)]
*  the most disastrous domestic policy and the war on terrorism has been [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2330.24s)]
*  the most disastrous foreign policy, there's a strong argument to both of those. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2334.2s)]
*  And the amount of people who have been, you know, with the war on terrorism, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2340.04s)]
*  obviously the amount of people who have been killed and the amount of countries [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2344.2s)]
*  that have been destroyed and the amount of money that it's cost us. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2346.96s)]
*  And with the war on drugs, I mean, you have, you know, what is it? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2349.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think it started in the early 70s under Richard Nixon. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2353.68s)]
*  And we're now 50 something years later. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2357.6s)]
*  And in the war on drugs, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2362.2000000000003s)]
*  drugs have done better than the Taliban did in the war in Afghanistan. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2365.52s)]
*  Drugs are still everywhere. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2370.52s)]
*  We have incredibly high OD numbers and just, you know, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2373.04s)]
*  this policy does not work. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2378.12s)]
*  It's a failure for the same reason that prohibition of alcohol was a failure. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2379.92s)]
*  The prospect of combining those two [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2385.56s)]
*  policies, essentially, you know, with saying that we're going to have a war [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2387.84s)]
*  on terrorism on drugs is it look, it has the potential to just be. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2392.52s)]
*  An unmitigated disaster, and so that's something that I think is worth pointing [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2399.84s)]
*  out now again, the devil is going to be in the details what actually is done [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2404.2s)]
*  after this, but that would be the one that jumps out to me as like particularly [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2407.7599999999998s)]
*  troubling. All right, guys, let's take a moment and [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2411.8s)]
*  thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Monetary Metals, a company I've been [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2414.2000000000003s)]
*  telling you about for quite a while, they are revolutionizing the precious [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2418.52s)]
*  metal space, gold prices have been breaking all time highs in 2024. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2422.48s)]
*  And now you can get your gold to work for you, generating interest income every month [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2427.1600000000003s)]
*  paid in additional ounces of physical gold. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2432.48s)]
*  You can earn up to five percent on your [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2435.7200000000003s)]
*  gold and silver in their lease offerings and accredited investors can earn [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2437.7200000000003s)]
*  double digit returns in their bond offerings. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2441.84s)]
*  Again, all the interest is paid in ounces, which are stored for free on your behalf. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2444.44s)]
*  So if you're tired of your gold and silver [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2449.88s)]
*  collecting dust at home or worse, racking up fees, having your metal [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2451.92s)]
*  professionally stored, check out monetary dash metals dot com to learn how you can [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2455.52s)]
*  start putting your metals to work today. That's monetary dash metals dot com. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2460.8s)]
*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2466.28s)]
*  All right, where you want to talk a little bit about a little bit about Fauci. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2469.12s)]
*  But I can't believe that guy got a pardon. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2474.4s)]
*  There is a saving grace, though, I was [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2476.92s)]
*  reading in zero edge day because this made me feel good because I was going to. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2478.7200000000003s)]
*  And I still will. I'm going to campaign, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2482.6s)]
*  which basically means get a hat or t-shirt that says prosecute Fauci, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2485.32s)]
*  because I say, go after him anyways, get after him anyways. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2488.8s)]
*  Don't let the guy off the hook. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2491.92s)]
*  The American people need to be educated [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2493.56s)]
*  about what took place during the covid regime. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2495.44s)]
*  And they need to be fearful of government power and not just giving it over [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2498.52s)]
*  to the government because they need the education that they were lied to. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2502.36s)]
*  And then it probably was criminal. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2506.12s)]
*  And so even if Fauci is not going to go [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2507.6800000000003s)]
*  to jail or be held accountable in other ways, prosecute him. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2509.44s)]
*  Let the story out there. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2513.6800000000003s)]
*  I think it's a cleansing and people need to know it. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2515.0s)]
*  Apparently, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2518.08s)]
*  I guess, though, now they can bring him in front of Congress and the Senate again. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2519.76s)]
*  And give him a hard time. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2525.48s)]
*  And they can even ask him questions such as the last times you were here, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2527.04s)]
*  were you lying to us? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2530.6s)]
*  And if you were to say things like, no, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2531.92s)]
*  now he could be guilty of a new crime that he can be prosecuted for. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2534.28s)]
*  So, yeah, there's some yeah, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2538.2000000000003s)]
*  there's some some crafty legal maneuvering that can be done because he could. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2539.8s)]
*  By the way, what's interesting about that, right, is that if they were to get him [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2544.2000000000003s)]
*  to testify before Congress again and they asked him if he had lied last time he's [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2548.0s)]
*  there, he could say yes and face no prosecution for that. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2552.88s)]
*  So he can now admit that he lied to Congress. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2557.56s)]
*  Right. But if he says no, then this is after the pardon and it's a new crime. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2560.36s)]
*  So he's not pardoned for future crimes. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2565.28s)]
*  And so it would lead you in this situation where either he would at least be open [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2567.6400000000003s)]
*  again to prosecution for the same crime of lying to Congress, or he would have to [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2573.96s)]
*  admit that he lied to Congress, which in some ways might be more valuable than [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2578.48s)]
*  getting a conviction. You know what I mean? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2582.44s)]
*  Like in some, you know, I said yesterday on the show, I know you you didn't have a [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2584.08s)]
*  chance to listen to it because the show just came out a few hours before we're [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2588.16s)]
*  recording this one. But I did say I kind of think this is a good thing. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2591.56s)]
*  Like on net, I'm kind of glad that Biden [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2596.96s)]
*  pardoned all these people, because the truth is that. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2599.64s)]
*  Even me and you might have some feelings [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2603.84s)]
*  of optimism or cautious optimism about like maybe Trump can get some good things [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2606.84s)]
*  done. The idea that he was actually going to [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2611.96s)]
*  prosecute Fauci was always a little bit up high in the sky. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2615.32s)]
*  You know, like, oh, my God, if we get to that point, we've already done so many [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2620.28s)]
*  good things that and you know, and so the idea of this was always going to be true. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2624.76s)]
*  And so I'm not so sure that Biden doing something that, number one, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2629.88s)]
*  brings this conversation of Fauci being a criminal right back to the forefront, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2636.36s)]
*  gives people like me and you an excuse to talk about it more and then also like [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2640.56s)]
*  kind of reveals that he needed this legal protection or maybe he would. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2645.68s)]
*  You know, like that in itself is kind of a victory. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2649.96s)]
*  And so I'm looking at this whole thing like, yeah, I don't see why this should. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2652.48s)]
*  Look, the important thing is not that an old man, Anthony Fauci, who already got [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2658.48s)]
*  away with it, you know, like even if you get him that this is like [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2666.0s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby or something like that, they already got away with it. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2670.44s)]
*  Now, you may say you still want to see him thrown in jail now, but [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2675.32s)]
*  that that's not really is it Fauci already had a decades long run of being a corrupt [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2680.0400000000004s)]
*  criminal and the whole covid thing, he did it and he got away with it. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2687.36s)]
*  I don't like I do want to see Fauci prosecuted. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2690.48s)]
*  I do want to see him spend the rest of his [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2693.8s)]
*  life in jail for the crimes that he did commit. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2695.36s)]
*  But that is not the most important thing. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2697.7200000000003s)]
*  The most important thing is that these crimes get exposed and, you know, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2702.0s)]
*  that it it sends a shockwave through future would be state criminals. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2706.48s)]
*  Anyway, that's I you know, I do tend to agree with what you're saying. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2712.96s)]
*  There's still a lot of interesting kind of, you know, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2716.0s)]
*  then maybe they could go after other people who were criminals, too, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2719.28s)]
*  who didn't get pardons and have forced Fauci to testify at their trial. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2722.92s)]
*  You know, like there's there's possibilities there. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2728.44s)]
*  We'll see. Who knows? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2730.8s)]
*  Who knows if Trump's really going to go after that? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2732.28s)]
*  I do wonder if there will be a wider conversation about the pardoning system [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2734.52s)]
*  because now that Biden's done this, I don't know why you wouldn't just always [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2739.7200000000003s)]
*  pardon yourself and your family members on the way out as a precautionary thing. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2744.64s)]
*  And once that becomes a norm, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2749.08s)]
*  then you're really giving people a free pass to basically have four years to [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2751.04s)]
*  potentially commit crimes, not that I think these people aren't somehow being [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2755.28s)]
*  bribed or otherwise, but it definitely gives them a platform for being more [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2760.44s)]
*  aggressive about it and the presidential pardoning system. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2764.2000000000003s)]
*  It's it's kind of, you know, in some instances people get freed [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2767.7200000000003s)]
*  because the president goes, hey, I think that was a mistake. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2772.6400000000003s)]
*  And hopefully like Ross will be freed [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2774.88s)]
*  because the president's basically acknowledging, hey, I think that that that [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2776.6400000000003s)]
*  incident lacked justice. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2779.88s)]
*  But even that's kind of terrible that random people can get selected instead of [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2781.6400000000003s)]
*  the overall injustices being like, well, why was that guy prosecuted? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2787.32s)]
*  Why did the FBI go after him? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2791.32s)]
*  Why do they go after him in this way? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2792.6800000000003s)]
*  Who else did they go after? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2794.32s)]
*  It's not a very fair system to just take the one offs and go, oh, you carried [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2795.8s)]
*  enough public favor that people are aware of the injustice of your [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2800.28s)]
*  your case, so you're going to get out. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2804.48s)]
*  You know, the whole thing is a little it's a little absurd. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2806.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, 100 percent. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2810.2s)]
*  Especially, by the way, for the people have been like, you know, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2812.3199999999997s)]
*  freaking out about the president isn't above the law. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2814.64s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but now you've just established this president that I guess [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2817.16s)]
*  you can just always pardon preemptively whoever you want to. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2820.64s)]
*  I mean, yes, it does seem ridiculous. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2823.7999999999997s)]
*  You're always be foolish not to. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2826.08s)]
*  If you're on if you're on a second term, the last day out, hey, it just becomes [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2827.52s)]
*  the new norm, hey, here's my list of of people I'm giving a free pass to so [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2831.7999999999997s)]
*  that the next party doesn't come after us and that it just becomes the new norm. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2835.88s)]
*  It seems like that could be the case. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2840.8s)]
*  By the way, there's also I should mention there's just because some people have been [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2844.36s)]
*  having fun with it online, it's great. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2848.0s)]
*  It's just like everything else. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2850.84s)]
*  It really is. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2852.4s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2854.12s)]
*  The the way that [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2855.6800000000003s)]
*  the corporate media projects things on to Donald Trump that are confessions [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2859.32s)]
*  themselves, you know, like it's just, you know, even all the the fears that he's [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2864.48s)]
*  going to weaponize the justice system for political reasons, you know, stuff like this. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2869.12s)]
*  But there's been a lot of because it's easy to forget these things when you live [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2873.16s)]
*  in these crazy years, but there's been a bunch of compilations of [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2877.12s)]
*  the media freaking out at the prospect of Donald Trump doing exactly what Joe Biden [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2881.64s)]
*  did toward the end of his first term, where they were like, oh, on the way out, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2888.44s)]
*  he's going to pardon his whole family preemptively. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2893.0s)]
*  And then they're all of them have their hot takes on what that would mean and how [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2896.2s)]
*  terrible that would be, and that would be an admission of guilt, says Rachel Maddow. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2901.04s)]
*  You know, it's just really there's just it's just, you know, whatever. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2906.4s)]
*  We cover their hypocrisy enough, but it is pretty entertaining to watch some of that stuff. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2910.28s)]
*  I do want to spend at least a few minutes here. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2913.84s)]
*  Let's talk about Ross Ulbricht [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2917.44s)]
*  a little bit because it does it seems that OK, so as of now and I'm, you know, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2920.56s)]
*  checking my my news updates because if this does change, I would like to [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2925.96s)]
*  to get it live. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2931.2400000000002s)]
*  But as of now, it seems that the pardon has not come yet. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2932.52s)]
*  There are let's I'll just say that I have many sources at this point, several sources [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2936.88s)]
*  both off the record and on the record who have essentially said that [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2943.8s)]
*  it's in the stack, you know, it's in the stack of things that Trump's about to sign. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2949.8799999999997s)]
*  It's either going to happen tomorrow. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2953.64s)]
*  Give the man a break. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2955.64s)]
*  Well, that's true. That's true. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2957.3599999999997s)]
*  He's got things to do. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2958.68s)]
*  And I certainly do. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2960.2s)]
*  You know, I saw there were again in the spirit of Darrell's tweet, there were, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2961.64s)]
*  of course, libertarians out there who were like, you know, why are the January six [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2965.9199999999996s)]
*  people pardoned first and Ross Ulbricht isn't pardoned yet? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2969.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, he spent more time in jail than them. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2973.2s)]
*  You know, it's like, guys, obviously, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2975.3999999999996s)]
*  the January six things had more. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2977.7599999999998s)]
*  Political. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2981.16s)]
*  Significance in terms of a signal for Donald Trump to come in and do this was [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2984.84s)]
*  a giant, you know, on top of being justice, it was also a giant middle finger [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2989.56s)]
*  to the entire corporate media and the political establishment. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2995.0s)]
*  So that, you know, I'll just say that it does seem right now, you know, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=2998.52s)]
*  Elon Musk tweeted that he's going to be freed. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3002.52s)]
*  Roger Stone confirmed that his name is [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3006.64s)]
*  in the stack, that Donald Trump is just in the middle of getting to. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3009.52s)]
*  So and also, by the way, on I know on the betting markets, it's like it's like 95 [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3012.8s)]
*  percent that he's getting freed. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3019.76s)]
*  So I will say this just, you know, with [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3021.96s)]
*  the disclaimer that this obviously has not happened yet and nothing is official [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3026.28s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. until it's official. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3031.16s)]
*  So that disclaimer out there, it looks very likely like Ross Ulbricht is going [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3032.96s)]
*  to be freed today or tomorrow, assuming that does happen. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3039.6800000000003s)]
*  You know. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3047.1600000000003s)]
*  I'll just say it's I've never exactly had a situation like this before. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3049.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know Ross Ulbricht. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3054.6800000000003s)]
*  I have never met him. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3056.52s)]
*  I've never had a conversation with him. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3057.6800000000003s)]
*  I do know his mother fairly well. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3059.7999999999997s)]
*  I've met her many times, as has almost everybody in the Liberty [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3063.48s)]
*  world, because she's just at every event. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3068.12s)]
*  She's just like tirelessly been working for years and years to get her son freed. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3071.7999999999997s)]
*  If people don't know the story of Russ Ulbricht, he was the founder of the Silk [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3078.92s)]
*  Road. It was kind of like a dark web website type thing. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3082.92s)]
*  And he essentially was convicted of creating a website. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3087.7999999999997s)]
*  Now, there were accusations that had been made by the feds that he was trying to put [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3092.4s)]
*  like hits out on people or something like that without even like going deep into [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3099.72s)]
*  the story. The bottom line is none of that shit matters because he didn't get [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3104.68s)]
*  convicted of any of that. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3107.96s)]
*  All he got convicted of was a nonviolent [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3109.16s)]
*  victimless crime of creating a website, and he's been in jail for years. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3111.56s)]
*  He's serving, I think, multiple life sentences over it, or at least a life [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3116.72s)]
*  sentence. And I mean, I just remember Lynn fighting for this cause when it seemed [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3121.2799999999997s)]
*  hopeless, like it seemed like nobody. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3129.84s)]
*  What were the odds of like, this is one kid and he got on the wrong side of the [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3132.16s)]
*  federal government and it's over. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3136.96s)]
*  He's been convicted. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3138.52s)]
*  They gave him life without parole. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3139.7599999999998s)]
*  He's never coming home. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3141.52s)]
*  And she just never stopped fighting for anybody who's ever met her. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3142.88s)]
*  She's like the sweetest lady. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3146.08s)]
*  And it was always just very apparent that she was like living through this nightmare, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3148.68s)]
*  you know, like her son is gone and the rest of her life is doomed to just be [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3153.72s)]
*  constantly, you know what I mean, like trying for the next thing and then being [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3159.48s)]
*  devastated when it doesn't work out. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3163.6s)]
*  And man, like just personally, because I know her, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3165.72s)]
*  like it would just be so great for her [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3171.0s)]
*  nightmare to be over and just have her son home with her. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3173.84s)]
*  And I'm really excited at the possibility that that's going to happen. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3177.1600000000003s)]
*  It seems very likely that it's going to happen. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3180.44s)]
*  And, you know, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3182.6000000000004s)]
*  look, obviously a lot of a lot of people played a role in this happening, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3185.84s)]
*  no one more than Lynn, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3192.36s)]
*  but a tremendous amount of credit has to go to Angela McCardell [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3195.28s)]
*  for for really making this the central demand of the libertarian party out of [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3199.6s)]
*  Donald Trump and to get if he does get freed, which it looks like he's going to. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3207.84s)]
*  The fact that Donald Trump came to the libertarian party convention and made [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3213.56s)]
*  this promise and then won and then came through on the promise. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3218.6400000000003s)]
*  And look, you know, people can argue over the details of what exactly the promise [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3221.76s)]
*  was. You know, people will say, like, well, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3226.04s)]
*  Donald Trump said, if you support me, libertarians, then I'll do this. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3229.12s)]
*  And the libertarians didn't technically support him. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3232.48s)]
*  But you could also kind of like, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3235.04s)]
*  look, look at the vote totals of Gary Johnson and Joe Jorgensen and then look [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3238.72s)]
*  at the vote totals of Chase Oliver and then look at how Donald Trump did [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3243.92s)]
*  in this election. And you could see that like, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3247.72s)]
*  like, I'm not the only one, you know, a whole lot of libertarians ended up [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3250.56s)]
*  going and supporting Donald Trump. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3254.56s)]
*  And if this does happen, I do think I don't think it's unreasonable [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3256.32s)]
*  to say that Angela McCardell accomplished more than the libertarian party has [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3261.6s)]
*  in its entire history in her in her two terms. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3266.16s)]
*  I mean, like this, you actually saved a human being's life, corrected a massive [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3271.48s)]
*  state injustice and gave this like, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3277.88s)]
*  I don't know, gave like a [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3282.2400000000002s)]
*  desperate mother her, you know, like you made her prayer come true. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3285.96s)]
*  And I do listen, I'm not trying to say [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3291.4s)]
*  that credit is only to Angela or anything like that. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3294.1600000000003s)]
*  There are obviously a lot of people who have fought for this and have worked [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3296.6400000000003s)]
*  tirelessly on it and they all deserve some degree of credit to it. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3299.96s)]
*  Everybody who ever wrote a piece about this or ever did any activism about this, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3304.68s)]
*  everybody deserves like some credit if it comes to fruition. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3310.12s)]
*  But I will say that particularly, you know, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3313.44s)]
*  to the people who were involved in the whole Mises Caucus effort to take over [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3318.44s)]
*  the libertarian party, look, I'm not saying like [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3323.04s)]
*  everything didn't work out exactly the way that we thought it would [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3326.92s)]
*  or exactly the way we planned it out. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3331.3599999999997s)]
*  But I do think that that is more than enough to say that like. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3333.9199999999996s)]
*  Your effort in that was worth it. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3340.9599999999996s)]
*  I mean, like this effort led to something and something tangible. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3344.64s)]
*  And it's not as if Russ Ulbrich is the only tangible thing. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3348.56s)]
*  I mean, I think that this is, you know, we have, you know, people say they want to [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3352.7999999999997s)]
*  kind of heard some of the libertarians who were more critical of this strategy [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3358.52s)]
*  of supporting Donald Trump and trying to get concessions out of him or assurances [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3363.3599999999997s)]
*  out of him. And they'll say they'll point to things [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3367.3999999999996s)]
*  that maybe he didn't come through on. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3369.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, he did say he was going to put a libertarian in his cabinet. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3371.24s)]
*  Now, Trump supporters could argue he said [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3374.56s)]
*  that if the libertarians nominate him and support him, he'll put a libertarian [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3376.4399999999996s)]
*  in his cabinet. OK, he didn't put a libertarian in his cabinet. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3380.04s)]
*  Now, he'll claim people will claim Bobby [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3382.56s)]
*  Kennedy is a lifetime member of the libertarian party. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3385.0s)]
*  So he could be the libertarian. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3387.72s)]
*  But other people will say, well, he's not really a libertarian. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3388.9599999999996s)]
*  He just joined the party recently. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3391.44s)]
*  Obviously, I'm not going to argue about that. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3394.28s)]
*  No, Bobby Kennedy is not 100 percent are libertarian. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3396.4s)]
*  At the same time, it's like I don't think any of us. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3402.36s)]
*  I certainly never said it. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3405.0s)]
*  I don't think you could find Angela McCardell ever saying we got to support [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3406.36s)]
*  Donald Trump because we know he will come through with 100 percent of the things he [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3410.32s)]
*  promised if we gave him the nomination, even though we didn't give him the [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3414.84s)]
*  nomination, that was never really the argument. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3417.88s)]
*  The argument was like, at least we're getting something. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3420.8799999999997s)]
*  At least we're getting some assurances [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3424.7599999999998s)]
*  that there is the potential there for something positive to happen. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3427.08s)]
*  And also, as I'm sure many of you guys know my attitude, it's like I don't even [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3430.7999999999997s)]
*  really know. OK, he doesn't have a libertarian in his cabinet. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3434.44s)]
*  Jay Bhattacharya has Fauci's old job. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3438.48s)]
*  OK, so like, I don't know what you want to say here. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3441.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, I don't really care. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3445.12s)]
*  That's so much more important to me than [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3446.64s)]
*  whether someone identifies themselves as a libertarian. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3448.56s)]
*  I'd rather Jay Bhattacharya be in charge [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3451.0s)]
*  of the NIH than Chase Oliver have any position in there, because I can't even [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3453.08s)]
*  trust that Chase Oliver will have the courage to actually stand up for his [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3457.44s)]
*  stated principles when there's a little bit of pressure. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3461.48s)]
*  Yeah, right there. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3464.2s)]
*  There you go. That might be more like what we'd get done. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3466.16s)]
*  Jay Bhattacharya wrote the foreword for Tom Woods' [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3469.7999999999997s)]
*  magnificent book on COVID. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3473.96s)]
*  So, hey, libertarians, you know, our best [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3476.3199999999997s)]
*  libertarian who wrote the most important book on the most important issue? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3479.04s)]
*  This is the guy who wrote the foreword for that book is now in charge of the [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3483.2s)]
*  National Institute of Health. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3486.7999999999997s)]
*  So, again, like. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3489.0s)]
*  Forget that stuff. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3491.6s)]
*  But if we do, we've already collected some wins. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3493.68s)]
*  And if we collect more wins or even just say we get the ones we got now and we get [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3497.2s)]
*  Russ Ulbrich freed, not only do I think that that justifies the entire Mises [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3503.3999999999996s)]
*  caucus, the entire project and all the effort that so many people put in to make [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3509.96s)]
*  this happen, because Angela McCardell simply does not become chair without us [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3514.0s)]
*  putting her in his chair and nobody else was going to do this other than Angela [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3518.52s)]
*  McCardell. And so not only do I think it justifies the entire thing, but I think it [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3523.12s)]
*  also look, it [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3527.8799999999997s)]
*  leads to a compelling case for what the [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3531.2000000000003s)]
*  libertarian party ought to be used for going forward. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3533.76s)]
*  And it leaves members of the libertarian [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3536.92s)]
*  party with a very clear choice in front of them. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3539.0s)]
*  You know, like this is something that. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3541.84s)]
*  It was a very unique thing that I think you could make a very strong argument that [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3546.36s)]
*  even as a Republican, you probably couldn't have gotten these guarantees out [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3550.84s)]
*  of Donald Trump, because having the libertarian party represented like a [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3556.6800000000003s)]
*  whole separate voting bloc that he wanted to pull over to get behind him. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3559.68s)]
*  And going forward in the libertarian party, I think that. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3565.12s)]
*  It's like, hey, what do you guys want to do? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3570.24s)]
*  Do you want to kind of see this model that results in tangible wins for liberty? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3573.3599999999997s)]
*  Or do you want to go back to kind of like impotently virtue signaling, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3580.8399999999997s)]
*  consistently losing and seeing no improvement in real life? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3586.3199999999997s)]
*  Now, don't get me wrong. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3590.6s)]
*  As I've always said, I really haven't changed my mind from where I was a few [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3591.7999999999997s)]
*  years ago, if you've got some amazing presidential candidate or something like [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3594.8399999999997s)]
*  that who you think it's more important that this person is going to wake up [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3598.72s)]
*  millions of people and spread a message and it's going to lead to local victories [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3602.16s)]
*  and all these things, there's an argument that that's the direction you should go [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3605.88s)]
*  when you have that person. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3609.92s)]
*  If you don't have that person, it's just a waste of resources. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3612.0s)]
*  And time and effort. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3616.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think that the blueprint that Angela [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3617.92s)]
*  McCardell has kind of laid out is the way to go going forward with the libertarian [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3620.8399999999997s)]
*  party. But look, obviously, first and foremost, it's. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3625.48s)]
*  It's going to be just like my first thought is just like how great that would be for [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3631.8399999999997s)]
*  Lynn, you know, like, and it'd be amazing for her to have her son home. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3636.12s)]
*  But then I do think that, like, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3640.92s)]
*  you know, again, assuming that this happens, which I think it's going to happen [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3643.4399999999996s)]
*  today, but assuming it happens today or tomorrow, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3646.4399999999996s)]
*  that's something that kind of has to be [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3651.2s)]
*  examined for the first time in the libertarian party's history. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3653.0s)]
*  They did something kind of incredible. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3656.3999999999996s)]
*  They were like able to like get something they wanted done from the president of [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3658.24s)]
*  the United States of America. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3663.7599999999998s)]
*  That is something that libertarians simply that type of effect, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3665.3599999999997s)]
*  that type of victory is simply something that libertarians cannot afford [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3670.56s)]
*  to not examine and think very seriously about and go like, wow, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3676.36s)]
*  we punched a bit above our weight here. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3680.92s)]
*  We were able to actually make something happen. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3683.0s)]
*  All right. Now, I'm not saying you just run that back and do it exactly the same. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3685.6s)]
*  It's like, hey, maybe we should think about what's our next target going to be. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3689.08s)]
*  What's the best way to ensure that? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3692.72s)]
*  But this is something that can be recreated, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3695.68s)]
*  can be tweaked, augmented and could perhaps really deliver [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3700.72s)]
*  even bigger victories in the future. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3706.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's something that's an interesting conversation. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3708.52s)]
*  I'll be interested to [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3711.48s)]
*  to be talking to like Michael Heiss and Angela McCardell about this in the coming [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3713.44s)]
*  days, because I do just think that this this really has the potential to shake up [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3717.6s)]
*  the way third parties are viewed and the way third parties are used [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3723.24s)]
*  in in America, which is a pretty damn important thing. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3729.12s)]
*  All right. I guess that's that's all. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3734.64s)]
*  Anything else you want to add there, Robbie? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3737.0s)]
*  Looking forward to some Trump round two action, we're off to a good start here. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3740.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's going to be it's going to be an exciting week. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3743.8s)]
*  And there's no question that Donald Trump seems to he seems to really want to [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3747.6s)]
*  demonstrate that there's a difference between like the energy level of Joe Biden [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3753.64s)]
*  and Donald Trump, which I mean, OK, I guess that's not that hard to demonstrate. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3759.2799999999997s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3762.16s)]
*  And he seems to I think he Donald Trump, if nothing else, he really understands [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3763.2799999999997s)]
*  marketing and he really understands like that. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3770.7599999999998s)]
*  There's been a vibe shift in America and you could see he's capitalizing on that. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3774.7999999999997s)]
*  He wants to get a lot of stuff done right now. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3780.16s)]
*  And so I think this is going to be an interesting, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3782.4s)]
*  an interesting start to to this term. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3784.76s)]
*  All right. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiJ_m3O1k6g&t=3788.0800000000004s)]
