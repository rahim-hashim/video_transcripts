**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k)

*  I do apologize for the mess up in the schedule. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=19.56s)]
*  I'm going to make episodes up to you guys this week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=24.48s)]
*  I know I'm two members only in the can. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=26.52s)]
*  We will get those to you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=29.76s)]
*  Me and Rob were down in Fort Lauderdale, getting, I'm sorry, down in Key West, getting a little [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  bit of R and R over the weekend and doing some shows. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=36.04s)]
*  Thanks to everybody who came out to the shows. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  Man, it is fun to go down to Key West in the middle of the winter when you live in the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Northeast. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=44.72s)]
*  I told you it's fun down there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=45.96s)]
*  I wasn't lying. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=47.2s)]
*  It's a good drinking town. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=48.2s)]
*  You were not. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=49.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=50.2s)]
*  It's I can't even describe how good a drinking town it is. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=51.2s)]
*  It's such a good drinking town. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  It's a dangerous town. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=56.84s)]
*  You just sit there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  You're flying. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  My wife came down and we hung out at this resort the whole weekend and we're just I'm [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  like floating in the pool and I'm like, all right, let's have our first drink. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=63.16s)]
*  You know, what is it? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=66.12s)]
*  And then it's like 9 15 in the morning. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=67.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=69.0s)]
*  That might be a little bit early. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=70.0s)]
*  It might be a little bit early to start, but we did and we lived and we're back. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=71.0s)]
*  If I went to a town in Russia and there were like 97 year old women and they're all sitting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=74.96s)]
*  around smoking cigarettes, I'd be like cigarettes aren't that bad for you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  They're all doing it here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=81.72s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=82.72s)]
*  I mean, they're fine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=83.72s)]
*  And then you go down to Key West and they're all like 65. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=84.72s)]
*  They look OK and they're drinking for breakfast. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=86.62s)]
*  You're like, this can't be that bad. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=90.78s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=92.94s)]
*  It's a dangerous game to play. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=93.94s)]
*  But man, was it a lot of fun? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=94.94s)]
*  I'm looking forward to that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=95.94s)]
*  I want to go back. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=97.26s)]
*  I want to make that like a regular winter thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=98.26s)]
*  We go down during the winter to Key West. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=100.7s)]
*  Get out of this for a little bit. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=103.5s)]
*  Anyway, it was a lot of fun. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=104.5s)]
*  We got a lot of stuff coming up and also just a lot to talk about on today's episode. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=105.98s)]
*  So let me try to do this as quickly as I can. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=111.06s)]
*  Tomorrow night, I'm assuming it's happening as planned. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=116.54s)]
*  I know there's some some bad weather forecasts out here in New Jersey. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=119.38000000000001s)]
*  But tomorrow night, I will be debating Josh Hammer at Princeton University on the US-Israeli [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=122.94000000000001s)]
*  relationship. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=130.78s)]
*  Very much looking forward to that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=132.22s)]
*  I believe there are it's pretty filled up, but I think there are a few seats available [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=133.34s)]
*  if you want to go. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=136.82s)]
*  I just posted it on my Twitter. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=137.82s)]
*  There's a link there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=140.02s)]
*  And then in a couple of weeks, we will be in Houston, Texas at the Punchline. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=141.46s)]
*  And then after that, at Helium Comedy Club in Buffalo, New York, me and Robbie the Fire [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=146.38s)]
*  Bernstein are both really looking forward to those gigs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=154.86s)]
*  So obviously, we were off for the second half of last week. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=155.86s)]
*  And so a lot's happened. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=161.58s)]
*  And there's a few things that I really wanted to make sure we talked about. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=163.46s)]
*  OK, let's start with this, which I just find very fascinating. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=169.06s)]
*  And it has to do with Donald Trump's approval numbers. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=174.06s)]
*  So let's look, I want to let you listen to CNN explain this because, well, for a lot [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=178.58s)]
*  of reasons, number one, let's get some eyeballs on them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=186.06s)]
*  Not too many people watching. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=188.94s)]
*  We can up those numbers a little bit. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  We'll probably double it just by playing this clip on the show. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=191.5s)]
*  But also, it's just it's interesting to watch even them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=195.26s)]
*  Admit this and then maybe let's talk about what this means exactly. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=197.94s)]
*  So let's let's go to the CNN clip. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=202.1s)]
*  Let's let them say it first and then we can we can respond. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=204.1s)]
*  CBS News out with a new poll showing that Americans seem to be liking what they're [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=208.18s)]
*  seeing, but it's a mix. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=214.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, it's but it's not just CBS. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=216.86s)]
*  You know, I like to take an average of the polls. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=219.22s)]
*  I like to take an average of the polls. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=220.94s)]
*  And holy smokes, I mean, look at what the difference is between now versus eight years [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=222.9s)]
*  ago during the first Trump term. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=226.98s)]
*  Right. This is Trump's net approval rating on February 10th. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  You go back to 2017. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=231.06s)]
*  Trump was already underwater at minus five points from the net approval rating. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=232.66s)]
*  That's approval minus this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=235.98s)]
*  What a difference eight years makes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=237.33999999999997s)]
*  He's on the positive side of the ledger at plus four points. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=239.1s)]
*  And again, it's not just the CBS News poll. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=242.17999999999998s)]
*  We're talking about the Gallup poll. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  We're talking about the Ipsos poll. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=245.89999999999998s)]
*  We are talking about the Pew poll. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  All of these respective pollsters have Trump in a better position now than they did [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  eight years ago. The bottom line is Americans are more or more are likely to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  say they like what they're seeing now versus what they felt during Trump's first term. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=256.94s)]
*  OK, so how rare is this? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=261.94s)]
*  Are you going to show us sort of where we're at now and how rare it is that this? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=263.86s)]
*  Yeah. So I want you to take a look at this plus size, this plus sign, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=269.14s)]
*  Compare that to the negative side. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=273.14s)]
*  Being on the plus side. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=274.78s)]
*  Oh, they really do talk to you like you're idiots. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=276.22s)]
*  A positive net approval territory, a positive net approval rating for Donald Trump. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=277.86s)]
*  Again. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=282.62s)]
*  Entire first term, just 11 days, just 11 days. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=286.26s)]
*  Donald Trump feels like the SNL run faster. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=290.14s)]
*  The approval rating. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=292.26s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=292.9s)]
*  Compare that to the second term. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=293.61999999999995s)]
*  Just so far, just so far. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=295.05999999999995s)]
*  Every single day. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  And it just doesn't. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=298.82s)]
*  Second term so far, he has been on the positive side of the ledger. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=299.7s)]
*  Twenty one days all three weeks. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=303.26s)]
*  That's already 10 more days than he was in his entire term. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=304.94s)]
*  So again, this is just another sign that Americans are far more likely to like what [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=309.85999999999996s)]
*  they're seeing. This is 2% milk. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=315.42s)]
*  It's not like the 1%. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=317.7s)]
*  There's a whole nother percentage of milk in there. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=319.42s)]
*  His second term. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=322.22s)]
*  Here, I just want to get this next number out there, but it is funny how they talk [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=322.98s)]
*  to you like you're a fucking retard. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=326.5s)]
*  Is there something that Americans say about why it is that they that they like him [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=328.06s)]
*  now more than they did back in the first term? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=333.18s)]
*  You know, I think one of the things that's so important for politicians is for folks [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=336.5s)]
*  to believe what they're saying and that they're keeping their campaign promises. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=340.06s)]
*  So I think this gives you a pretty gosh darn good idea of what may be going on. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=343.62s)]
*  Trump's doing what he promised to do. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=347.94s)]
*  You go back to April of 2017. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  It was just 46% of all Americans who said that Trump was doing what he promised to do. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=352.94s)]
*  Compare that now to February of 2025. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=358.46s)]
*  You know, there was a good show that was on during the 1990s called A Different World. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=361.78s)]
*  That is what's going on right now. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=366.26s)]
*  We're living in a different world. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=368.06s)]
*  70% of Americans say Trump is doing what he promised to do. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=369.5s)]
*  We can act now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=374.14s)]
*  I'll throw in another stat you don't need. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  It is, by the way, it is almost before you even get to the substance of these polls, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=378.02s)]
*  which is very interesting. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  But before you even get to that, it is hard to not just be like, what does CNN think [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=384.14s)]
*  of the intelligence of their viewer that they actually they it's the way I'd explain [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  this to my six year old is like how they talk to you about it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=394.53999999999996s)]
*  It's like very. Yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=397.14s)]
*  No, I get plus minus. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=398.54s)]
*  I know the difference. You don't have to. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=400.22s)]
*  And why does it help for him to underline it? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=401.66s)]
*  Like as if I couldn't see there's two numbers on the screen and then he has to go. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=404.14s)]
*  No, let me underline. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=408.06s)]
*  Now you see the first number. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=409.54s)]
*  OK, now here's the second number. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=411.02s)]
*  The second number is higher. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=413.02s)]
*  And so you understand. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=415.1s)]
*  That's like, yeah, no, I get it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=416.3s)]
*  This is to inside baseball. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=418.54s)]
*  But that guy's like if you combine the ShamWow guy with Modi. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=419.78s)]
*  If you know Modi, the standup comedian, it's a it's a solid reference for the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=424.41999999999996s)]
*  for there's five people out there who really enjoyed that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=429.97999999999996s)]
*  But it is OK. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=433.26s)]
*  So there is that part, which is just kind of funny. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  But there is something to watching these poll numbers, to watching Donald Trump. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=436.58s)]
*  And by the way, you know, they they were comparing it to his poll numbers [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  at the very beginning of his first term, I think they had April 2017 in there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  So a little bit further than than where he is this time. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=450.34s)]
*  But that doesn't even count his poll [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=453.82s)]
*  numbers that fell dramatically lower over the next years of his administration. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=455.58s)]
*  So Donald Trump, according to these polls, is starting from like a much stronger [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=459.9s)]
*  place than essentially he's ever been. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=465.18s)]
*  That is very interesting. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=467.58s)]
*  I also will say this and look, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=469.38s)]
*  I'm speculating a little bit when I talk about this. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=472.66s)]
*  So I'm throwing this out there more as [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  something to think about than I have a definitive take on this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=477.5s)]
*  But one of the one of the major themes [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=482.86s)]
*  that we talked about on the show quite a bit throughout the election, which really [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=485.58000000000004s)]
*  was, you know, an election unlike any other that I've lived through. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=489.34000000000003s)]
*  And one of the things that I would just notice a lot was that every every sign [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=494.26000000000005s)]
*  around you, you know, everything you could observe or touch or taste or feel [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=500.78000000000003s)]
*  just told you that this was Trump's year, like that Donald Trump was running away [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=505.78000000000003s)]
*  with this thing, whether you were looking at crowd sizes or, you know, crowd [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=511.26s)]
*  reactions to Donald Trump, anything you could feel in the popular culture [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=516.02s)]
*  throughout the entire campaign, it just felt like it was all going in Donald [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=520.54s)]
*  Trump's direction. And yet the entire time the the major pollsters, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=524.02s)]
*  the ones being cited here, the, you know, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=529.46s)]
*  whatever CBS was the poll they started with there and then they mentioned Gallup [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=533.06s)]
*  and I think ABC and CNN and a few others. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=537.02s)]
*  All of these polls told us all election long this was a coin flip. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=539.6600000000001s)]
*  It was a coin flip. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=544.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, he was up a little bit against Joe Biden. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=545.58s)]
*  But then once Kamala Harris came in, she went up for a little bit. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=547.46s)]
*  And then it came back to just being a coin flip of a race, according to them. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=550.1800000000001s)]
*  Everything you could observe was telling you this is all Donald Trump. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=553.9000000000001s)]
*  All the pollsters were telling you this is a coin flip. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=557.14s)]
*  And then on Election Day, you have Donald Trump winning the popular vote [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=559.82s)]
*  in every single swing state. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=563.62s)]
*  Reality was much closer to what we could [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=565.98s)]
*  observe than it was to what these pollsters are telling you. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=568.26s)]
*  And I got to say, I know none of this is scientific. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=571.7s)]
*  This is why I said I'm just speculating about this stuff. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=574.06s)]
*  But you see Donald Trump go to UFC events. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=576.62s)]
*  You see him go to the Super Bowl. You see him go to all these things. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=579.3s)]
*  Again, not a random sample. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=582.54s)]
*  It's a particular slice of America that's going to UFC events or going to the Super [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=584.62s)]
*  Bowl, but he is just he's met like a king. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=588.7s)]
*  Like people are just so thrilled. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=592.54s)]
*  They're so on board with him. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=594.58s)]
*  And, you know, I think about again, this is not nothing scientific about this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=596.38s)]
*  But there was that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=601.22s)]
*  there was right after inauguration, you saw there was that video clip of Tucker [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=602.98s)]
*  Carlson walking through the streets of Washington, D.C. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=606.54s)]
*  And he's getting like a hero's welcome. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=609.42s)]
*  Like I would have a couple of years ago [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=611.78s)]
*  thought it would be dangerous for Tucker Carlson to walk the streets of Washington, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=614.02s)]
*  D.C. And now that people are chanting as he walks by, we love you, Tucker. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=618.34s)]
*  You know, and there is just I'm just saying it makes me [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=622.58s)]
*  wonder what's really going on here. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=625.74s)]
*  You know, it seems like the polls always very consistently from the beginning have [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=629.3s)]
*  like Donald Trump's always outperforms what the polls are saying he does. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=638.34s)]
*  And when even the polls now are admitting [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=642.5s)]
*  that he is in the positive in his job approval ratings or that 70 percent of [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=645.3s)]
*  Americans think he's coming through on the things that he ran on, I just it makes me [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=649.42s)]
*  wonder what the real number is and if it's possible that the real number is [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=653.94s)]
*  actually much, much higher than this, just something I'm thinking about. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=659.22s)]
*  What's more interesting to me than the poll number is just [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=663.6600000000001s)]
*  during covid, they lied and they pretended like everyone was getting vaccinated. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=668.4200000000001s)]
*  You're crazy if you were. Yep. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=671.98s)]
*  They lied to pretend that Donald Trump [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=673.3800000000001s)]
*  couldn't possibly win against Hillary Clinton because they wanted to convince [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=674.98s)]
*  you don't waste your vote, be on the winning side. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=677.94s)]
*  Vote for Hillary Clinton. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=680.2600000000001s)]
*  We know now from USAID, Politico was getting checks. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=681.6600000000001s)]
*  BBC was getting checks. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=685.58s)]
*  Their entire game is to try and pretend like everything is in the world of normal. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=686.94s)]
*  And if you don't agree with them and that's why they repeat things as much as [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=691.1800000000001s)]
*  they do, that's the propaganda machine. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=694.38s)]
*  It's interesting that CNN would give any favorable coverage to him whatsoever. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=696.6600000000001s)]
*  And I'm almost surprised to see them reporting on this, same as they didn't [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=702.34s)]
*  report on border stats for a long time during the Biden administration. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=705.5400000000001s)]
*  So it's almost more surprised, like more than the indicator of the poll, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=709.54s)]
*  the fact that CNN is forced to cover it in a favorable way and not just go, my God, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=714.22s)]
*  I guess, five percent more of the country's racist now that he's actually ahead [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=719.26s)]
*  in the polling to me is the more remarkable story. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=722.86s)]
*  Right. But that's what makes you wonder if it's a limited hangout of sorts, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=726.02s)]
*  where it's like, well, we have to at least [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=730.06s)]
*  admit this to cover up the much bigger story, you know, which is something is [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=731.86s)]
*  a technique that they use, you know what I mean? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=735.82s)]
*  Like they will admit to 10 percent of the scandal so that we say, OK, yes, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=737.9s)]
*  this did get a little out of our hands. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=742.94s)]
*  We're rolling that back to kind of let the wind out of the the, you know, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=744.46s)]
*  let the air out of the movement that's furious about the other 90 percent. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=748.42s)]
*  So if even that's that's what makes me think that if they're even admitting that [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=752.38s)]
*  this guy is in the positive in his job approval rating, then perhaps it's them [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=757.0600000000001s)]
*  covering up the story that he's way in the positive. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=763.5s)]
*  Again, as we've said for a while now, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=766.1s)]
*  you know, when this guy says we live in a different world, I did enjoy that show, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=768.46s)]
*  by the way, when he says we live in a different world, it's like, well, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=771.9000000000001s)]
*  why are we in a different world? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=775.1800000000001s)]
*  And really, the obvious answer here is that we lived under four years of Joe Biden. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=776.74s)]
*  And it's impossible to not contrast [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=781.0200000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump with the last administration, like with all administrations. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=783.86s)]
*  It's impossible to not, to some degree, contrast them with the last one. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=787.22s)]
*  And by any objective measure, Donald Trump, by just existing, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=791.3000000000001s)]
*  is so much better than Joe Biden. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=795.4200000000001s)]
*  We're also not three weeks into hearing about how he's a Russian asset. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=797.62s)]
*  So it's it's I mean, they're also the polls just started. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=802.1s)]
*  Let's see if he goes and he redevelops Gazan, what that does for his polling. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=805.62s)]
*  We'll get into that in a second. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=808.98s)]
*  Obviously, we have to weigh in on the guys. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=810.38s)]
*  You just think of how much of a change it is from cooking up [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=812.4200000000001s)]
*  a fake Russia collusion story to actually reporting, hey, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=816.5400000000001s)]
*  the American people like this guy so much that to me, that's [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=820.6600000000001s)]
*  that's a massive change. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=824.46s)]
*  Going from the entire media apparatus just undermining you [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=826.02s)]
*  to actually giving the honest information of, wait, people like this guy. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=829.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And and of course, it's like. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=832.94s)]
*  Why look, I guess I'll start with this, right? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=836.94s)]
*  Because what you said there, even about the Gaza thing, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=840.78s)]
*  and we'll we'll get into the specific the specifics of that in a second. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=842.9s)]
*  But it does let you know, like, look, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=846.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is in there right now and he's got, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=849.6600000000001s)]
*  let's just say a lot of certainly from our perspective, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=853.3s)]
*  a lot of good things that he wants to do. Right. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=856.18s)]
*  Like he wants the economy to be booming. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=859.9399999999999s)]
*  He wants to get illegal immigration under control. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=862.06s)]
*  He wants, I think, on some level for there to not be foreign wars like this. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=865.5s)]
*  He wants to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=870.5s)]
*  You know, the stuff in the Middle East is a little bit more not great. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=872.62s)]
*  But having Doge, I mean, wanting, you know, to [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=876.8199999999999s)]
*  to to kind of audit the federal government and cut spending [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=880.78s)]
*  and and reveal corruption within government. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=884.9s)]
*  There's all of these great things. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=887.22s)]
*  And right now he's got a strong approval rating. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=888.6600000000001s)]
*  He's got this kind of mandate behind him. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=891.26s)]
*  He's got the energy and the vibe shift behind him. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=893.3000000000001s)]
*  And you just it feels like, look, there's going to be a moment of of [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=896.02s)]
*  coming back down to reality. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=901.0600000000001s)]
*  There will be some point Trump will mess something up. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=902.38s)]
*  There will be something unpopular that he does. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=904.9s)]
*  This is kind of the way it always goes with presidents, no matter who they are. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=907.0600000000001s)]
*  But you can't overstate how much you need to not fall into one of these [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=910.22s)]
*  potential disasters, because that's what could really ruin all of this. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=914.86s)]
*  If you can keep this up where you're somewhat popular and the the [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=918.82s)]
*  the corporate media and the old regime, the shadow government, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=925.98s)]
*  they seem to kind of be out of bullets in their chamber. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=931.34s)]
*  It seems like they just don't have another thing to go to. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=934.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, like, you know, like as you mentioned, Robin, you're absolutely right. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=937.0600000000001s)]
*  What were they doing last time around? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=940.02s)]
*  Well, they were smearing him as a Russian spy. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=941.66s)]
*  That was their game for the first Trump term. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=943.98s)]
*  But after Russiagate completely fell apart and after Covid [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=946.82s)]
*  was just exposed for all the lies that were told, it seems like they don't have [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=950.86s)]
*  another big one of those to go to. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=954.46s)]
*  Like, what are they going to say? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=956.5s)]
*  He's a Russian spy again. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=957.66s)]
*  You know, like it just doesn't seem possible. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=959.5s)]
*  And in that environment, there's when I. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=961.9s)]
*  When I say that, like, there's never been an opportunity [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=966.98s)]
*  to actually see a positive agenda moved forward for the country [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=972.0200000000001s)]
*  like we have right now, there's never been anything even remotely close. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=975.82s)]
*  Like, there's just never been anything like this before, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=979.6600000000001s)]
*  particularly with some of the stuff that's going on at Doge, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=982.46s)]
*  which I want to get into a little bit more. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=984.7800000000001s)]
*  But that's part of the reason why it's so important that Trump [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=987.38s)]
*  doesn't fall into one of these disasters. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=990.86s)]
*  And what would the disasters be? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=992.46s)]
*  Well, the pretty obvious ones right now would be getting into another [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=993.82s)]
*  catastrophic war in the Middle East or getting into [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=998.46s)]
*  an escalated confrontation with Russia. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1003.22s)]
*  These seem to be the real dangers that are right in front of Donald Trump right now. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1005.86s)]
*  So if he can avoid that, then we can continue with this positive agenda [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1009.62s)]
*  where things that, again, I can't really stress this enough, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1014.62s)]
*  things that would have seemed like libertarianism [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1018.82s)]
*  libertarian pipe dreams two years ago [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1023.0600000000001s)]
*  are now being discussed by people with enormous influence and power. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1027.22s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1032.7s)]
*  which is my patriot supply. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1035.54s)]
*  We've all seen the headlines, cyber attacks on the power grids, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1037.34s)]
*  drones flying in the sky, constant instability around the world. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1040.8600000000001s)]
*  If you are anything like me, you want to make sure that no matter what happens, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1044.9s)]
*  your family is protected. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1048.78s)]
*  And that's why I trust my patriot supply. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1050.58s)]
*  Their four week emergency food kit is a must have. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1052.86s)]
*  It gives you the nutrition you need to stay strong in a crisis [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1056.06s)]

*  The kit keeps you going when every meal matters. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1065.1799999999998s)]
*  Right now, they're offering $50 off their four week food kits. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1068.3s)]

*  I don't know. Did you see this? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1084.94s)]
*  Our very own Liam McCollum. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1086.98s)]
*  Did you see what Elon Musk said to him? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1089.62s)]
*  Let's let's pull that tweet up, Natalie, so people can just look at this. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1091.7s)]
*  This is what I'm talking about. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1094.94s)]
*  As as there are libertarians who want to fight about the latest drama [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1097.3s)]
*  on the LNC or like whatever some ridiculous factionalism. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1100.98s)]
*  Our own Liam McCollum, guest on this show. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1106.3s)]
*  Great. One of the most talented young libertarians out there in the country. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1109.54s)]
*  He tweets out Doge and Elon Musk should let Ron Paul [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1114.22s)]
*  lead a Federal Reserve audit team, to which Elon Musk replies. Good idea. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1118.3s)]
*  Elon Musk also recently shared like an entire episode [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1124.18s)]
*  of the Ron Paul's Liberty Report, his show, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1129.82s)]
*  and to his hundred thirty million Twitter followers or whatever it is he has. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1134.82s)]
*  You have the richest man in the world, one of the most influential men [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1140.3s)]
*  in the world who's in charge of this, you know, kind of imaginary department, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1144.8999999999999s)]
*  but seems to be turning it into some real things. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1149.3799999999999s)]
*  He's in charge. He is sharing the message of Ron Paul. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1151.8999999999999s)]
*  He just tweeted out this phenomenal Milton Friedman video [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1155.6599999999999s)]
*  where he's talking about how the only issue that matters is government spending [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1158.6999999999998s)]
*  and that that ultimately is the tax. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1162.02s)]
*  And it doesn't really matter whether they tax you for it or print the money [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1163.94s)]
*  to make it up. They're still taxing you for it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1166.8200000000002s)]
*  Even if they borrow the money, they're just promising to tax you in the future for it. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1168.94s)]
*  So the only thing that matters is cutting government spending. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1172.14s)]
*  Like, I'm sorry, but as somebody who's been in this libertarian world for [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1174.8200000000002s)]
*  what is 2007 is when I got into it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1183.9s)]
*  So what is this? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1187.22s)]
*  Eighteen years I've been in this libertarian world. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1188.42s)]
*  And this is like this is a wet dream, man, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1191.58s)]
*  that our ideas would ever be shared on this like large of a platform. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1194.6999999999998s)]
*  The whole thing back then was that Ron Paul got into the presidential debates [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1198.86s)]
*  and they would never give him much time. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1203.02s)]
*  They'd give him like seven minutes total. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1204.4599999999998s)]
*  But in those seven minutes, he could say some awesome shit [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1206.06s)]
*  that would just be like, you know, that stole the debate. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1209.1s)]
*  And that and then the Internet was the only way you could spread [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1211.58s)]
*  because the the corporate media would black him out. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1214.3s)]
*  This was the Jon Stewart joke, if you remember. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1216.8999999999999s)]
*  Why are they pretending Ron Paul is the 13th floor of a hotel? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1219.5s)]
*  Because they would literally Jon Stewart literally plays this clip from CNN [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1223.22s)]
*  where they go, they go, they go. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1226.94s)]
*  Mitt Romney is now in the polls. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1230.1s)]
*  Mitt Romney is now the favorite to be the Republican nominee, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1232.22s)]
*  knocking Michelle Bachman down to third. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1235.42s)]
*  And then Jon Stewart's like, who's number two? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1238.62s)]
*  They would just not tell you like they would literally report on one and three [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1241.74s)]
*  and leave out two. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1246.1s)]
*  It was so they just wanted to make sure no one heard this guy's message. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1246.98s)]
*  And now people are hearing this guy's message from like this huge [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1251.46s)]
*  being amplified on the biggest platform. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1255.98s)]
*  Like that alone is so valuable. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1258.1s)]
*  But also, Elon Musk has like found this team of like [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1260.3s)]
*  tech geniuses to really like go over the numbers. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1264.78s)]
*  And he's openly talking about auditing the Federal Reserve. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1268.14s)]
*  I just can't explain how great that is. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1271.38s)]
*  And, you know, that's part of these things are all related. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1273.18s)]
*  Like Donald Trump's approval ratings being high is like a necessary component [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1277.1s)]
*  to be able to do anything positive with this shit, because you have to have [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1281.94s)]
*  somewhat of a popular mandate. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1285.58s)]
*  That's at least part of it. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1287.7s)]
*  You know, like we've always said for years, right, that you would need [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1288.94s)]
*  these different aspects to come together in order to ever have [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1292.38s)]
*  anything positive happen in D.C. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1295.9s)]
*  Like one, you would need popular will behind the ideas. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1297.6200000000001s)]
*  Like you would need people who were [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1302.42s)]
*  who had been broken out of the government propaganda and were kind of like [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1305.7s)]
*  aware of how corrupt and criminal it was. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1309.18s)]
*  And then you would also need like, you know, elites. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1310.98s)]
*  You would need like some billionaire who's like gets on board and is like, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1315.5s)]
*  yes, I'm going to fund this thing. I'm going to get behind it. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1318.98s)]
*  I'm going to put resources into this. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1321.3799999999999s)]
*  And we just kind of seem to see at least possibly [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1323.1s)]
*  a lot of these things coming together right now. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1326.58s)]
*  Like, oh, we have that component now. Oh, we have that component. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1329.02s)]
*  It's a pretty exciting time. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1332.02s)]
*  Also, and I know, Rob, you got to love this. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1334.54s)]
*  The the reaction to doge in many ways says it all. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1337.1399999999999s)]
*  Like the fact that everyone's freaking out so much about the fact that what? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1342.54s)]
*  Like these books might be opened. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1347.78s)]
*  We might actually be able to look and see what you're spending our money on [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1350.98s)]
*  and then maybe even roll some of it back. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1355.02s)]
*  And you see the freak out from people. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1357.34s)]
*  You could if you got that, there's the other video that I sent you, Natalie. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1360.66s)]
*  I think that I didn't put in the order for today, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1363.82s)]
*  but it's the one with Kara Swisher, who I was just arguing with on Pierce Morgan. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1365.46s)]
*  We don't have to go to it right now, but if you want to just pull that one up. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1371.02s)]
*  But isn't it interesting, Rob, as somebody who you've been talking about this stuff [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1374.22s)]
*  for a long time to see people actually talking in a serious way about [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1377.4199999999998s)]
*  government spending and then to see it's the first one I sent you. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1382.58s)]
*  No, not that one. It's up on the text thread. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1386.98s)]
*  It was the one that I had sent you. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1389.06s)]
*  Right at eight 14 a.m. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1394.82s)]
*  this morning, right after I told you that I've decided to move. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1398.1399999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's the one right after I told you that I was staying in Key West forever [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1402.22s)]
*  and I quit everything. That was my next text after that. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1405.4199999999998s)]
*  But hold on one second on that. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1407.7s)]
*  But any any thoughts on what you're saying, Rob? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1408.7s)]
*  What about the in the freak out or any of it? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1411.58s)]
*  One of the parts of the freak out, which is incredible, is the people going, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1414.82s)]
*  hey, this is such a small portion of our of how much money we spend. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1418.6599999999999s)]
*  And he goes, wait, are you against cleaning up fraud and abuse? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1424.1s)]
*  You think we should just let that slide? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1427.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, it seems like the low hanging fruit to clean that up. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1429.98s)]
*  And where's the Bernie Sanders screaming about with the millionaires, the billionaires? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1432.82s)]
*  Well, what about the people who became millionaires [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1436.86s)]
*  because of a government check that just goes into a thing? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1439.06s)]
*  What about those people? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1441.82s)]
*  You got a problem with the free market millionaires, but not the [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1443.26s)]
*  green energy, New Deal people, the Obama thing that just went under in California. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1446.26s)]
*  What about all the people with favorable government contracts? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1450.86s)]
*  What about all the people that constitute the one percent [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1453.86s)]
*  because they're just getting these government checks through backdoor [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1456.46s)]
*  handouts for, you know, transgender research in Jamaica? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1460.06s)]
*  Dude, it's such a great point. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1463.62s)]
*  I mean, I don't even remember the the numbers offhand, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1464.78s)]
*  but somebody please correct me if I'm wrong about this. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1468.54s)]
*  And I'm sure Bernie Sanders said something vague [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1470.86s)]
*  about the transfer of wealth during covid. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1474.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, I'm sure you had some comment about like, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1477.6599999999999s)]
*  oh, we're creating more billionaires and that's why we need to tax them. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1480.22s)]
*  Or that's why we need more government programs. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1483.34s)]
*  But did he ever once like say like, hey, well, I think it was like 40 [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1485.06s)]
*  new pharma billionaires were created during the Coba during covid. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1489.1s)]
*  You know what? Sorry, I said it like Bernie Sanders during Coba. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1493.74s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1497.1399999999999s)]
*  There was something it was something like that, like dozens of new [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1497.74s)]
*  pharmaceutical billionaires were created during covid. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1500.62s)]
*  Did Bernie Sanders ever have a problem with that? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1504.6599999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like he never seems to really highlight [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1506.86s)]
*  the billionaires that are created by government and make that argument. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1509.6599999999999s)]
*  Because like at the very least, if that was your concern, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1513.22s)]
*  you'd think you should have been against all the covid policies. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1516.18s)]
*  Right. So the largest transfer of wealth in human history [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1518.42s)]
*  from the working and middle class to the elite. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1521.18s)]
*  Yet you have no issue with that. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1523.8200000000002s)]
*  They're just think look, and I think this kind of says it all right here. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1525.74s)]
*  But if you just really zoom out and think about Doge and the reaction to it. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1529.3s)]
*  OK, we this these are just like some objective facts, right? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1534.9s)]
*  We the US federal government is the biggest [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1538.9s)]
*  organization in the history of the world. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1542.38s)]
*  OK, by any measurement, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1544.9s)]
*  they we spend about seven trillion dollars a year and we are something like [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1547.6200000000001s)]
*  thirty six trillion dollars in debt right now, maybe approaching thirty seven [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1553.74s)]
*  trillion dollars in debt. OK, biggest organization in the history [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1558.2600000000002s)]
*  of the world spends more money than anybody else in the history of the world [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1561.98s)]
*  and has accumulated more debt than any other organization in the history [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1565.7s)]
*  of the world. And as soon as anybody even suggests modest cuts or even just opening [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1569.5s)]
*  the books, everyone in this town loses their freaking mind and says it's going [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1575.34s)]
*  to be the end of the world and that in fact, this is the corruption. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1579.8999999999999s)]
*  The corruption is opening the books. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1583.4199999999998s)]
*  The corruption is cutting any government spending. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1585.22s)]
*  Think about for a second how fucking ass backward that is. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1587.62s)]
*  You know, it's like, look, the whole thing here, the whole game is that. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1591.4199999999998s)]
*  This is big government. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1599.06s)]
*  I mean, this is what it is. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1600.66s)]
*  And people can sit here and they can say, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1602.14s)]
*  as some kind of like right wing reactionary types will argue at times, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1604.54s)]
*  they'll say that, like, well, it doesn't really matter how big or small [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1610.1s)]
*  the government is, it matters how corrupt they are, it matters how good they are. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1613.14s)]
*  But libertarians always had the answer to that. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1616.5s)]
*  Like from way that was always the point. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1618.82s)]
*  It was like, yeah, but that's why you don't want the thing to be giant. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1620.7s)]
*  Because if it goes corrupt, then you're screwed. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1623.74s)]
*  And so they're like, no, no, no. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1626.42s)]
*  The problem isn't that it was so big. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1627.46s)]
*  The problem is that it went corrupt. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1628.74s)]
*  No, the problem is that it was so big and it went corrupt. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1630.26s)]
*  If it was if it wasn't a gigantic [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1632.94s)]
*  organization, it wouldn't matter that much that it went corrupt. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1634.82s)]
*  This is the whole game. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1637.42s)]
*  The whole game is that they operate in secrecy and they have enormous power. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1638.78s)]
*  That's it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1644.38s)]
*  All this wealth is extracted from the [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1645.78s)]
*  American people and given to this corrupt organization. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1647.38s)]
*  And so for that issue to finally, finally, so long overdue for that issue to finally [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1650.22s)]
*  be in the forefront is just amazing to watch. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1656.62s)]
*  And I got to say, I really enjoy watching the people spaz out over it because just [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1659.78s)]
*  look at like what they're reduced to arguing here. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1664.1399999999999s)]
*  Look at this. Let's let's play that clip. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1666.1399999999999s)]
*  I forget the other guy's name, but Kara Swisher is the one I was just arguing [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1667.86s)]
*  with on Piers Morgan. She was saying dumb shit to me. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1670.78s)]

*  I think this is a coup. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1715.98s)]
*  And be clear, just because the new insurrectionist who was elected, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1717.46s)]
*  you know, I don't believe this is legal and I'm going to hold the people [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1722.98s)]

*  We need to go gangster here and say, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1737.5s)]
*  there you go. Look, we are not negotiating around this stuff. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1741.66s)]
*  This is illegal. This is a coup. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1745.54s)]
*  This is the unlawful seizure of power. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1747.54s)]
*  We are not going to engage in these [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1750.26s)]

*  All right. You get we get balls here. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1761.38s)]
*  But of course, we're we're now conflating Gaza and Greenland with Doge or something [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1763.22s)]
*  like that. It's a coup, Rob. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1768.62s)]
*  It's another insurrection. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1769.86s)]
*  This time, the coup is when a president is democratically elected and does what he ran on doing. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1772.18s)]
*  That's a coup. You understand. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1779.6200000000001s)]
*  It's a coup when the guy who's democratically elected wants to open the books on the shadow [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1781.26s)]
*  government of non-democratically elected bureaucrats and spies. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1786.86s)]
*  You see, that's what a coup is. Right. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1791.14s)]
*  See, I'm over the same people who will say that I'm overplaying my hand when I call [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1793.38s)]
*  the Maidan Revolution a coup because the US pumped tens of millions of dollars [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1797.1399999999999s)]
*  into a protest movement to overthrow a democratically elected president. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1802.34s)]
*  That's not a coup. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1806.34s)]
*  A coup, you understand, Rob, is when you go against the good men and women of the [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1807.4599999999998s)]
*  CIA who just want to protect Americans. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1812.6599999999999s)]
*  This is like it's so it's so pathetic, the game here, too, because the other aspect, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1815.82s)]
*  which he kind of touched on there, is that they go [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1820.78s)]
*  like you're getting rid of charity, essentially. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1824.22s)]
*  If you want to bring down USAID or something like that, then you are, you know, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1827.3s)]
*  they'll point to like one thing where they bought some kids some meals and be like, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1831.6599999999999s)]
*  oh, look, you want these kids to starve. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1835.26s)]
*  But this is this is on the level of if, you know, the mafia would buy like, you know, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1837.1399999999999s)]
*  as they always did, right, they'd buy like a waste management plant or something like that. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1843.46s)]
*  And then you go, oh, we're shutting down the mafia, you know, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1847.7s)]
*  because they're like killing all these people and robbing from all these people [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1850.02s)]
*  and doing all this organized crime that they're kind of known for. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1852.6599999999999s)]
*  And you went, oh, so you just want everyone's toilets to overflow. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1855.9799999999998s)]
*  You just want everyone to be shitting in buckets. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1859.5s)]
*  And you're like, no, no, maybe we could do that part without the murder. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1861.6599999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1865.6999999999998s)]
*  Like, maybe that's really what we want to shut down. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1866.4599999999998s)]
*  But that's what they're trying to convince you of now that, in fact, right, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1868.78s)]
*  that look, even when you think about the the most [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1872.54s)]
*  drastic cuts that have been proposed, right, like I think when the Vakrom [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1878.34s)]
*  Swami was still with Doge, I think they had they had proposed two trillion dollars [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1882.5s)]
*  in in cuts, two trillion dollars in cuts would take us to like 2017 levels of government. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1886.7s)]
*  It would just be going back to pre pandemic, which, by the way, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1894.3400000000001s)]
*  this is how it always works, the ratchet effect of big government. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1897.3400000000001s)]
*  There's some emergency and they go, look, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1900.1000000000001s)]
*  we need record high government spending for that emergency. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1902.38s)]
*  And then that becomes the new baseline. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1905.22s)]
*  And then we increase from there. Right. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1907.26s)]
*  So like if we had to like, say we had to [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1909.1399999999999s)]
*  turn government spending way up in 2020 during Covid, that was the justification. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1912.18s)]
*  Well, why can't we go back to 2019 now? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1917.3799999999999s)]
*  Isn't Covid over? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1919.5s)]
*  Oh, no, that's just normal forever now. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1920.94s)]
*  Same with George W. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1923.02s)]
*  Bush's spending levels after 9-11. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1924.7s)]
*  It's an emergency. There's 9-11. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1926.82s)]
*  We have to increase government spending. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1928.26s)]
*  And by the way, we're never going back down. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1929.7s)]
*  We've never seen pre 9-11 levels of spending since then. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1931.58s)]
*  Obama, the 2008 fiscal crash. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1934.7s)]
*  The answer to that was the stimulus package. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1937.54s)]
*  Again, the same thing. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1939.6200000000001s)]
*  Just a different word for the same thing. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1941.3400000000001s)]
*  Increased government spending. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1943.42s)]
*  Do we ever go back to the George W. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1944.94s)]
*  Bush level spending? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1946.5s)]
*  Nope. And by the way, just to be clear, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1947.5s)]
*  when Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy proposed a two trillion dollar cut, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1949.74s)]
*  they're not proposing we go back to the pre 9-11 levels. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1953.66s)]
*  They're not proposing we go back to the pre 2008 crash levels. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1956.38s)]
*  They're proposing we go back to the pre Covid levels. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1959.46s)]
*  And we're supposed to act like in 2017 [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1962.82s)]
*  when the biggest, most powerful organization to ever exist was the US [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1967.06s)]
*  federal government, that somehow if we go back to that now, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1971.26s)]
*  that is the wild, wild west. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1974.94s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1976.94s)]
*  That is like that is cutting government to the bone and we could never survive on that. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1977.54s)]
*  It's all bullshit. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1981.8200000000002s)]
*  It's all an illusion. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1983.6200000000001s)]
*  The truth is, we could go we could go way smaller than that. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1985.26s)]
*  And we would just be better off for it. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1988.94s)]
*  Uh, I remember that guy was a real douche on Covid as well. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1991.66s)]
*  And I'm sure I'd like to see him regrow his hair because I don't like him [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=1995.8999999999999s)]
*  bringing such badness to our bald community. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2001.02s)]
*  There's so many great bald leaders out there. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2004.58s)]
*  And yet this you, Larry David, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2006.78s)]
*  that's all I can think of. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2010.1s)]
*  But there's I'm sure there's others. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2011.3s)]
*  He's not representing our community well. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2013.3s)]
*  And so I'd like to disavow him. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2015.4199999999998s)]
*  And same as I've disavowed some Jews and said, I don't like those Jews. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2017.22s)]
*  That guy doesn't represent me or my fellow balds. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2021.5s)]
*  That guy does not represent true baldness. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2024.5s)]
*  Yeah. The message of true baldness was always one of limited government and peace [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2027.0600000000002s)]
*  and prosperity. I agree with you completely. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2031.1000000000001s)]
*  Now, my second thought on this is that, you know, like I kind of look at Doge. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2033.8200000000002s)]
*  If I worked in an office, some boss came out and said, hey, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2040.38s)]
*  we're selling the following product and you think they're a little bit being a [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2043.42s)]
*  little bit too aggressive with the marketing. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2046.5800000000002s)]
*  But then it turns out the customers are real happy with the product. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2048.34s)]
*  And you go, all right, I don't really like the way we marketed this. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2050.78s)]
*  But I guess everyone's happy. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2053.22s)]
*  So it worked. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2054.66s)]
*  I don't know that I love the Doge mechanism. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2056.06s)]
*  I don't know that it like look at what happened with the Biden, Hunter Biden thing. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2058.54s)]
*  He had the Republicans investigating that forever. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2062.98s)]
*  I listened to that cattle rancher a million times talking about 20 companies, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2065.4599999999996s)]
*  this, that or the next thing. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2069.1s)]
*  It could be Elon Musk with his three wizards and some algorithms can actually [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2070.4199999999996s)]
*  cut through the entire government's budget and tell us where all the fraud [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2075.3799999999997s)]
*  and abuse is going to. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2078.54s)]
*  And I don't understand how you take the other side of that. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2079.7799999999997s)]
*  We should not get rid of the fraud and abuse from government. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2082.8599999999997s)]
*  Like you were saying, where's the queue? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2085.8199999999997s)]
*  Like if that's the end result. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2087.2999999999997s)]
*  So fine. Maybe there would be a better mechanism for how to clean this up. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2088.58s)]
*  And maybe Elon Musk, even if he's appointed by the president, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2091.8199999999997s)]
*  shouldn't be allowed to have a private company also. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2095.46s)]
*  Maybe. But even so, there are government contracts. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2097.94s)]
*  Microsoft has a government contract for the cloud or maybe it's Amazon at this point. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2101.02s)]
*  So and he's not even getting paid for this work. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2105.1s)]
*  So he's and it's from the directive of the president. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2108.3399999999997s)]
*  But so I'm all I'm saying is even if you take issue with the mechanism [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2111.1s)]
*  that it's Elon Musk doing it, what about the end result that we've seen so far? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2115.38s)]
*  Do you think is against the American people? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2120.22s)]
*  Listen, I would totally be open to the argument that this is not the ideal mechanism. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2123.54s)]
*  If anybody could present me with a plausible alternative to where maybe we'd get [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2128.62s)]
*  some of this action from. Yes, you're right. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2133.9s)]
*  Strictly speaking, this should come from the Congress and the Congress should be [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2135.94s)]
*  abolishing all these organizations, auditing all these organizations. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2139.98s)]
*  But that ain't happening. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2144.58s)]
*  And so, you know, yeah, I would rather some of the some of the things [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2146.1s)]
*  that Donald Trump's done through executive order, I'd rather they be done [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2150.82s)]
*  by the legislative branch and let him sign it into law. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2153.6600000000003s)]
*  That would certainly if you wanted to end birthright citizenship [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2156.14s)]
*  or if you wanted to, you know, whatever, ban men from competing with women [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2158.94s)]
*  in sports or if you want to do it. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2163.18s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be better off to have legislation that the next president [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2164.66s)]
*  can't just undo with an executive action. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2167.06s)]
*  OK. Present the lit. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2170.1s)]
*  You know, it's like I want to audit the Federal Reserve. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2172.5s)]
*  Thomas Massey just introduced a great bill to audit the Federal Reserve. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2174.66s)]
*  OK, is that going to pass? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2178.22s)]
*  Because then if not, I got to be honest, I think like [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2180.02s)]
*  I'm like I'm against tyranny. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2184.98s)]
*  I'm for individual liberty and natural rights. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2187.1s)]
*  I'm against tyranny. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2189.94s)]
*  I'm not that picky at this point about what method is used [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2191.82s)]
*  to roll back the tyranny and advance the individual rights. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2196.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know. I just don't really think we're in a position to be picky [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2201.1400000000003s)]
*  about the methodology. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2204.5s)]
*  It'd be tough to say. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2206.3s)]
*  Let's say Elon Musk just made these recommendations of, hey, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2208.3s)]
*  I found the following fraud and now Congress has to decide not to fund that fraud, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2211.1000000000004s)]
*  which would then be pretty ridiculous of Congress to go, no, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2215.86s)]
*  we're going to continue to send checks to the BBC. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2218.9s)]
*  We're going to continue to buy Politico memberships at forty thousand dollars [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2222.02s)]
*  for subscription. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2226.38s)]
*  We're going to continue to send trans money down to Afghanistan. Right. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2227.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't even understand the argument, though, that if Donald Trump wants to give [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2233.06s)]
*  data access to somebody to expose fraud and abuse, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2237.7000000000003s)]
*  that that should be illegal or that that should be considered a coup [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2241.5s)]
*  or that in some way it's dangerous. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2245.1800000000003s)]
*  Can you explain to me how the access to what should be public [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2246.86s)]
*  and transparent data is dangerous? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2250.02s)]
*  Yeah. Or how someone who's probably has better and more secure technology [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2251.98s)]
*  than I bet the Blackberries or whatever the government's working with. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2256.7400000000002s)]
*  And if you're the president, you can declassify information. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2259.94s)]
*  So if you can declassify information, how can you not say, hey, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2262.78s)]
*  I want this person to be able to access this data as the guy, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2265.6600000000003s)]
*  as your fellow Baldy was saying to you, Rob, because I don't even want to argue [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2269.1400000000003s)]
*  about this. There's a reason why he doesn't want to argue about this, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2273.1400000000003s)]
*  because you have no argument. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2276.7s)]
*  Yeah. Present the case. What is the what is the danger here? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2278.38s)]
*  Say it's a coup. And and but also, by the way, this is where you realize [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2281.06s)]
*  it's so it is something I mean, I've been beating this drum [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2284.94s)]
*  for so many years at this point. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2287.42s)]
*  But it's just so true that this is not a left versus right issue. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2288.94s)]
*  This is like an establishment versus dissident issue. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2293.02s)]
*  This is a this is a who wants to protect the regime [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2296.54s)]
*  and who wants to restore the republic. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2300.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably a USAD check. Yeah. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2302.14s)]
*  Because he's been out showing some bullshit and he doesn't want his money [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2304.8199999999997s)]
*  turned off. Look, it's one thing. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2307.54s)]
*  It's one of the things that I find to be unfortunate that that still exists, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2309.06s)]
*  that people just get and I'm not saying like left and right aren't useful concepts. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2312.5s)]
*  They certainly are. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2315.74s)]
*  But it's when people you'll see a lot of the Trump supporters like the left [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2316.8199999999997s)]
*  is freaking out or something like this. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2320.66s)]
*  Look, if you if the CIA is brought up [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2322.66s)]
*  and your definition of the CIA in your head is these great American patriots [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2326.66s)]
*  who are just out trying to save people's lives and you're going to unmask them, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2333.22s)]
*  you know, like as if as if it's taken [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2337.62s)]
*  as an a priori given that the CIA are just the good guys. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2341.1s)]
*  And so if they do anything in secret, then you're the bad guy [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2344.74s)]
*  for trying to reveal their secrecy. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2347.4199999999996s)]
*  Think about that. That is not a left or a right wing position. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2348.98s)]
*  That is I am a defender of the regime position. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2352.2999999999997s)]
*  Period. And nobody I mean, like nobody. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2355.7799999999997s)]
*  What like how brain dead would you have to be to actually believe that? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2358.8199999999997s)]
*  Who thinks that that's what the CIA does? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2363.2999999999997s)]
*  Just a team of good guys, just a team of good guys [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2366.4599999999996s)]
*  who are always out trying to protect Americans. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2369.54s)]
*  That's just what they're driven by. It's Jack Bauer is real life. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2371.7s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2374.7s)]
*  They're just always trying to torture the truth out of somebody [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2375.74s)]
*  so that we save everyone's lives. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2378.66s)]
*  Who doesn't recognize that the CIA is a paramilitary organization [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2380.4199999999996s)]
*  that lies the American people into war after war after war [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2384.3799999999997s)]
*  that commits covert military actions that are not [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2387.7s)]
*  totally undemocratic, that are not even decided [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2392.54s)]
*  by our democratic leaders most of the time. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2395.46s)]
*  I mean, come on, exposing the secrecy and the corruption of the CIA [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2397.78s)]
*  makes you the good guy, not the bad guy. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2401.58s)]
*  And if you have the opposite worldview, then I'm sorry, that's not [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2404.22s)]
*  that's not a left wing position. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2407.18s)]
*  That's just an evil defender of the regime. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2409.14s)]
*  And I, you know, that's a I wouldn't be surprised [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2411.94s)]
*  if you don't want to debate about that. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2415.54s)]
*  Because who the hell would want to take that position in a debate? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2418.34s)]

*  we hit both of these things. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2512.98s)]
*  And this is what happens when we're off for too long. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2514.34s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm backed up and I want to make sure we get all of this. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2516.46s)]
*  So first, we haven't yet. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2520.78s)]
*  So we got to talk about the Trump Gaza proposal, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2523.54s)]
*  which look, I just that's our rubble. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2528.9s)]
*  Our bombs made it. We own it now. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2533.1800000000003s)]
*  We demolish the area. We're going to rebuild it. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2535.02s)]
*  Well, it really is right. Israel breaks it. We buy it. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2537.7799999999997s)]
*  I guess that is the the lesson to be learned. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2540.8599999999997s)]
*  If you break it, you buy it. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2543.62s)]
*  But the you is Israel and then the other you has to be us. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2544.7799999999997s)]
*  Look, man. And and like I again, I say this as somebody who just said [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2549.4199999999996s)]
*  everything I've said on the show so far and somebody who supported Trump [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2554.54s)]
*  in this election and is just, you know, cautiously optimistic, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2558.02s)]
*  but incredibly hopeful about what could actually be accomplished [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2562.54s)]
*  in this administration. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2565.46s)]
*  This I do not think this plan is going to happen. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2567.02s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2569.6600000000003s)]
*  Almost inconceivable that he could actually get Egypt and Jordan [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2575.26s)]
*  to take in the Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2579.1000000000004s)]
*  But I just I I to be clear here, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2583.2200000000003s)]
*  this is about as awful a proposal as you as any president could make. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2586.42s)]
*  And this is and it and it part of what's so horrible about it [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2592.7400000000002s)]
*  is that it has the potential to like ruin all these other positives. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2596.86s)]
*  Like if Donald Trump actually were to try to go through with something like this, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2600.86s)]
*  this could really sink his administration. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2604.26s)]
*  It could plunge America into another just catastrophic quagmire [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2606.82s)]
*  and it could undo all of the good things he's done [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2612.2200000000003s)]
*  and all of the potential good things that he could do with this high [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2614.82s)]
*  approval rating and this new mandate and and all the energy [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2618.2200000000003s)]
*  behind the Trump administration. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2621.58s)]
*  So, man, I, you know, I don't think this is actually going to happen. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2623.14s)]
*  I think this is kind of a Trump first, you know, whatever. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2627.46s)]
*  It's like the way his mind works is that he's a real estate developer. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2631.58s)]
*  So he goes out oceanfront property. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2634.74s)]
*  Money could be made off this. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2636.82s)]
*  He's floating out an idea that I think he believes is going to put pressure [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2638.34s)]
*  on the other Arab nations. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2642.5s)]
*  But even that is just terrible, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2645.5s)]
*  because that's not really who needs pressure put on them. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2647.7799999999997s)]
*  Like the idea that you're pressuring any of these other countries, like, look, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2650.5s)]
*  even someone said to me when I was trashing this idea on Twitter [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2654.86s)]
*  and someone said to me, no, Dave, what he's really doing is putting pressure [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2659.1s)]
*  on Saudi Arabia to come to the table now and to negotiate in good faith. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2661.78s)]
*  It's like, dude, go look at Saudi Arabia's proposed peace plan. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2666.3s)]
*  It was totally reasonable already. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2670.14s)]
*  They took the same. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2672.26s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty easy to propose a peace plan in this region [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2673.06s)]
*  because the same plan has been on the table so many times before, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2675.98s)]
*  which is what 67 borders, you know, like a two state solution. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2679.58s)]
*  Like you guys have to stop occupying Palestine. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2683.94s)]
*  Palestine has to stop suicide bombing people in Israel. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2686.2200000000003s)]
*  Like that is the everybody knows what the solution is. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2689.1s)]
*  But the idea that people are saying, which is what seems to me to be [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2692.26s)]
*  the most common defense of this insane proposal that Donald Trump floated out, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2696.1400000000003s)]
*  which is like, got to try something new, got to shake it up. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2701.94s)]
*  The status quo hasn't been working. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2705.5s)]
*  It's like, OK, well, I agree with you on that. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2707.38s)]
*  What exactly is the status quo? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2709.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the status quo is unconditionally supporting Israel [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2711.6600000000003s)]
*  in no matter what, no matter what they want to do. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2715.58s)]
*  Even if what they want to do is against what the president wants them to do, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2719.02s)]
*  they'll still get their check in the mail. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2722.54s)]
*  They'll still get their bombs in the mail. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2724.38s)]
*  I don't think you send bombs by mail, but you get my point. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2726.46s)]
*  That's that's been the status quo. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2729.1400000000003s)]
*  So you want to shake things up and try something new. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2731.2200000000003s)]
*  OK, how about America not funding Israel anymore? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2733.38s)]
*  That's something new. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2736.46s)]
*  How about a Palestinian state? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2737.8199999999997s)]
*  That would be something new. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2739.46s)]
*  So don't just give it no just to shake things up and try something new. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2740.8599999999997s)]
*  Doesn't mean we will go ethnically cleanse the Palestinians out of Palestine [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2744.4199999999996s)]
*  for you, Israel, since that's been your goal all along. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2748.5s)]
*  It's like, oh, I don't know. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2752.2599999999998s)]
*  Like I'm all for, you know, I thought when Michael Knowles [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2753.3399999999997s)]
*  was defending it the other day and he said that he goes, well, you know, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2756.14s)]
*  the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2758.74s)]
*  and expecting a different result. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2761.62s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, OK. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2762.8599999999997s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that the definition of sanity is you just suggest [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2764.94s)]
*  anything that's different than the same thing. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2768.82s)]
*  You know, like, yes, if you if you have [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2771.58s)]
*  like a headache and you take Advil every single day and the headache won't go away, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2774.7000000000003s)]
*  then you take an Advil the next day and think in the headache is going to go away. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2779.46s)]
*  Maybe is a little bit insane to think the same thing is going to work [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2782.9s)]
*  this time when it hasn't worked. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2786.06s)]
*  But that doesn't mean hitting yourself in the head with a hammer is a great proposal. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2787.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, just because it's different doesn't mean [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2790.82s)]
*  it's the right thing to do. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2793.38s)]
*  And no, this would be, oh, my God. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2794.74s)]
*  First of all, the idea it's so not based in reality. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2797.3399999999997s)]
*  The idea that you're going to get Egypt and Jordan to take in the palace. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2801.8199999999997s)]
*  By the way, one thing you might have noticed from the press conference, Rob, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2805.54s)]
*  is that Trump said he said all of them and he said either one point six or one point seven million. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2808.62s)]
*  So by the way, you know, the latest numbers were that there were two point [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2815.74s)]
*  three million people in Gaza. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2817.8599999999997s)]
*  And so I'm just saying, I don't know exactly where he got these numbers from. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2820.2599999999998s)]
*  But I've always said from the very beginning of this, that the people who were arguing [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2823.7s)]
*  over whether the Ministry of Health's numbers were accurate or inaccurate, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2826.98s)]
*  that this was all a complete like non point. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2830.74s)]
*  And that if you just look at what Israel is doing here and you look at the population [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2833.94s)]
*  density and you look at the number of bombs that they've dropped, that there are going to be [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2837.66s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people who die as a result of this. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2841.46s)]
*  And it's a lot of them, which is what always happens in war. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2844.66s)]
*  A lot of them die from secondary effects. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2847.5s)]
*  You know, like they don't necessarily die because a bomb dropped right on top of them [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2850.2599999999998s)]
*  and killed them. They might die because they couldn't get medical [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2853.34s)]
*  treatment because all the medical resources have been exhausted due to the war. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2857.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like there's you blow up hospitals. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2861.06s)]
*  People die for unrelated reasons. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2863.58s)]
*  And so anyway, it's an interesting window into what the real numbers are there. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2865.86s)]
*  But Donald Trump makes the point that, oh, these other countries will take them [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2870.02s)]
*  and then we can go in there and build up. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2874.26s)]
*  But look, here's the bottom line. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2876.3s)]
*  How are you going to make them leave? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2879.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, they they've stayed through all of this. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2880.82s)]
*  They've stayed through decades and decades and decades of brutal occupation, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2883.9s)]
*  of brutal blockades. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2887.2200000000003s)]
*  How are you going to make them leave? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2888.78s)]
*  And if the U.S. owns it, as Donald Trump said, we're taking it over. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2889.82s)]
*  The assumption would be that we have to make them leave. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2894.02s)]
*  So you're saying what we're going to send the U.S. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2896.7400000000002s)]
*  military in to now fight a war with Hamas, something that Israel's been unable to [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2898.3s)]
*  eliminate Hamas by all intelligence reporting. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2902.94s)]
*  So what we're going to take that on now. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2905.7400000000002s)]
*  And also, is there any thought at all to like understanding that this has been at [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2907.5s)]
*  the center of the Muslim world's beef with America? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2913.66s)]
*  Like, this is the reason why we've had to deal with the al Qaeda problem, why we [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2918.34s)]
*  had to have this this terrorism issue to begin with. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2921.86s)]
*  Do you have any idea, like how much that will increase if we were to actually go [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2924.94s)]
*  in and just just transparently, nakedly finish the ethnic cleansing for Israel? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2930.3s)]
*  It is just it's a disastrous proposal. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2936.3s)]
*  And I truly hope it ends soon. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2939.38s)]
*  Like, dude, even entertaining this. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2943.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if there's anything you want to add to this, Rob. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2945.46s)]
*  It seems particularly cruel. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2948.3s)]
*  And for as much as I fought back on the sanctity of borders and Putin talk because [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2950.7000000000003s)]
*  of all the things we've been doing in the world and there was, you know, I think we [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2957.7000000000003s)]
*  provoked him and, you know, we're moving on. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2962.26s)]
*  We're moving a military close to him. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2964.38s)]
*  But the idea of Israel being able to bomb its neighbors out of the territory and then [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2965.7400000000002s)]
*  just keep it seems seems like it shouldn't be part of the world in 2025. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2970.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2976.94s)]
*  Well, listen, here's a let's play here. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2977.38s)]
*  Donald Trump did elaborate more on this for some people who were arguing with me that [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2979.3s)]
*  he wasn't saying that the Palestinians would get kicked out. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2983.46s)]
*  Some of the things he was saying in the Netanyahu conference also, where he goes, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2986.7000000000003s)]
*  the Palestinian people have just been unlucky and no matter what they say, they [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2990.2200000000003s)]
*  don't know how long they're going to be here. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2994.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's like he's just describing as if this was the result of an alien invasion. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=2996.06s)]
*  But you're sitting next to the guy who did it. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3000.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3001.8599999999997s)]
*  You're sitting next to him and going, the place has been destroyed. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3002.1s)]
*  It's unlivable. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3004.5s)]
*  It's horrible that people have to live like that. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3005.2999999999997s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, no, I agree. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3007.66s)]
*  You totally should kick him out for us now. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3009.02s)]
*  And then, of course, Donald Trump, you know, he speaks in kind of coded language, but at [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3010.8199999999997s)]
*  the same time, I know who this guy has always been, what his position on Israel has [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3014.4199999999996s)]
*  always been. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3018.1s)]
*  I know the people that he has around him in his cabinet. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3018.8199999999997s)]
*  I know that Miriam Adelson, our Palestinian friend, gave him a hundred million dollars. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3021.34s)]
*  OK, so it's like people are like, oh, he's not really saying this. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3025.6200000000003s)]
*  He's saying this. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3030.1800000000003s)]
*  It seems much more likely this is actually what he's saying. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3030.7400000000002s)]
*  He said Gaza would be for the people of the region, which sounds like the Palestinians [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3033.1800000000003s)]
*  would have to go. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3037.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3038.34s)]
*  So if it's not for the Palestinians, who are these people of the region that it's for? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3038.6600000000003s)]
*  Sounds like Israelis would be the answer to that. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3042.38s)]
*  OK, and here a bunch of people are arguing with me on Twitter. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3044.94s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3048.3s)]
*  He's just saying relocate them while we clean up all the mines and then they can go back [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3048.98s)]
*  in. Well, here is Donald Trump addressing that on his Super Bowl interview with Brett [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3052.82s)]
*  Bayer. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3057.06s)]
*  We'll build beautiful communities for the one point nine million people. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3058.58s)]
*  We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3061.98s)]
*  Could be five, six, could be two. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3063.98s)]
*  But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they are, where all of [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3066.34s)]
*  this danger is. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3070.82s)]
*  In the meantime, I would own this. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3072.18s)]
*  Think of it as a real estate development for the future. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3074.86s)]
*  It would be a beautiful piece of land with the Palestinians. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3079.3s)]
*  No big money's turned. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3081.86s)]
*  No, they wouldn't because they're going to have much better housing, much better. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3084.1s)]
*  In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them, because if they [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3088.78s)]
*  have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3092.94s)]
*  It's not habitable. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3095.54s)]
*  It will be years before it could happen. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3097.5s)]
*  I'm talking about starting to build. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3099.38s)]
*  And I think I could make a deal with Jordan. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3100.98s)]
*  I think I could make a deal with Egypt. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3102.7s)]
*  You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3104.22s)]
*  We'll build beautiful communities. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3107.42s)]
*  Just to be clear, this is the this is what he's saying. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3109.7400000000002s)]
*  We'll build them big, beautiful refugee camps and they'll love them so much. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3112.06s)]
*  They'll love the refugee camps in Egypt so much that they will. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3118.18s)]
*  I don't know. Whatever. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3123.5s)]
*  And I got to tell you, I also do think, you know, for people who argue with me about [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3124.7400000000002s)]
*  this and they're like, no, no, no, this is art of the deal stuff. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3128.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, it doesn't make any sense. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3131.1s)]
*  He's not putting pressure on the people you need to put pressure on to actually get [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3132.9s)]
*  to the right deal at the end of this. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3136.34s)]
*  And number two, I do not think there's any practical way that this can be pulled off. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3138.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, he can sit here and say, oh, we give foreign aid to Egypt and Jordan. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3143.34s)]
*  That is true. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3148.1000000000004s)]
*  You know, and people will point out like they'll go, they'll go, oh, well, look, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3149.1400000000003s)]
*  Dave, he was able to threaten tariffs on Mexico and Canada and get them to send [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3154.06s)]
*  10,000 troops each, you know, to the border. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3158.42s)]
*  And so, look, he's going to get these concessions out of them. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3161.1400000000003s)]
*  Look, I understand when people feel that way. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3163.9s)]
*  All you're really saying is that you don't understand the region at all and you [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3166.7000000000003s)]
*  don't understand the history and you don't understand the issues here. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3170.98s)]
*  And it's fine. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3173.1800000000003s)]
*  Not everybody has to. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3174.3s)]
*  But it is such a wildly different ask to ask Egypt and Jordan to take in nearly [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3175.6200000000003s)]
*  two million people than it is to ask Mexico to send 10,000 troops to their border. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3184.06s)]
*  That is not a regime threatening request that you're asking of Mexico. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3189.1400000000003s)]
*  Like the Mexican government does not believe that they will fall if they [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3193.26s)]
*  put 10,000 troops on the border. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3197.46s)]
*  But in Egypt, last time you had elections, the Muslim Brotherhood won. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3199.3s)]
*  And then there was a military coup. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3204.86s)]
*  And now there's a military dictatorship where they're holding [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3206.46s)]
*  that Muslim Brotherhood down. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3209.1800000000003s)]
*  You think they're just going to take in a bunch of people from Hamas and [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3211.7000000000003s)]
*  change around those numbers in Jordan. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3214.46s)]
*  You have a, I don't know the exact percentage split right now, but it's [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3216.9s)]
*  close to 50% of the population is Palestinian. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3219.5400000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3222.38s)]
*  You'd think the Hashemites are going to bring in another 500,000 Palestinians [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3222.94s)]
*  to give a majority or like that much more of a majority to the past. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3229.1s)]
*  It's like, these are very difficult questions to ask, but there are very, I [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3233.1400000000003s)]
*  should say very difficult things to actually achieve, but the idea that look. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3238.1400000000003s)]
*  But first of all, in theory, if the people of Gaza, if we got them, like if we gave [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3242.98s)]
*  them the option to relocate somewhere while Gaza is rebuilt and then they could [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3247.54s)]
*  move back in and they voluntarily wanted to do that, I'm not like necessarily [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3251.26s)]
*  opposed to that, like if you got Egypt on board to be like, Hey, we have these [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3254.9s)]
*  facilities, they can stay here until this thing is rebuilt and then they can move [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3258.42s)]
*  back. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3261.6200000000003s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3262.1400000000003s)]
*  But if you're actually talking about, this is just blatant ethnic cleansing. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3263.0600000000004s)]
*  If you're saying that we're just going to, against the will, we're going to [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3267.0600000000004s)]
*  force nearly 2 million people, whatever's left of that 2 million people, we're [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3269.34s)]
*  going to force them out and then make it something for Israelis to come and live [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3273.5800000000004s)]
*  in. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3279.46s)]
*  That is just, that's just so wrong and so not our responsibility to do. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3279.98s)]
*  It's just a disastrous proposal. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3288.7400000000002s)]
*  Really hope that Donald Trump changes his mind on that one. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3291.14s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3294.82s)]
*  is Moink. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3297.94s)]
*  I love this company so much, especially in this current moment where I think people [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3298.66s)]
*  are waking up to what's really in our food and how you kind of can't really just [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3303.42s)]
*  trust the supermarket. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3307.66s)]
*  You got to check out Moink. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3308.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3310.5800000000004s)]
*  Moink works with American family farmers. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3311.1400000000003s)]
*  The business is simple. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3314.26s)]
*  Moink meat comes from animals raised outdoors where a pig is free to be a pig. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3315.54s)]

*  I also there's a lack of conversation about the Israel responsibility for all [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3365.1400000000003s)]
*  the homes that they've demolished. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3370.02s)]
*  I mean, human life is an issue, obviously, but all these people, they [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3371.98s)]
*  got lost their homes like they're just returning to nothing. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3376.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's like and then when the ceasefire is over, they go back to the south. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3379.1800000000003s)]
*  This keeps like, well, I don't even you know, I mean, there's not much of a [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3384.6200000000003s)]
*  conversation here about Israel responsibility or what the plan is. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3387.7400000000002s)]
*  I could not agree more. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3392.54s)]
*  All right, listen, I just let's let's move over because I just do want to make [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3394.02s)]
*  sure I get this in today. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3396.94s)]
*  So evidently there's the the no agenda podcast with Adam Curry is the host of it. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3398.78s)]
*  I'm not familiar with it. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3409.06s)]
*  I've heard of the show before, but I'm not super familiar with it. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3411.02s)]
*  I know Adam Curry was a was a MTV VJ like way back in the day. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3414.9s)]
*  But anyway, he's a podcast. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3419.98s)]
*  And I guess he's been in the podcast game for a long time. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3421.02s)]
*  And they recently I just saw this earlier today that they were they were [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3423.62s)]
*  attacking Scott Horton on the show. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3429.82s)]
*  And then I listened to it and it was from our show. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3432.34s)]
*  It's the I think the last time I interviewed Scott. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3436.14s)]
*  And so I just look nothing personal against these guys. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3440.14s)]
*  But Scott Horton's my guy and I'm simply not going to allow him to be [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3445.18s)]
*  criticized in this manner without responding. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3451.94s)]
*  So I do want to play this. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3454.1s)]
*  I think we can probably get through it pretty quickly. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3456.74s)]
*  I listened to I think most of it and seemed like it wasn't anything too [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3459.22s)]
*  challenging to smack down. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3464.9s)]
*  But so I just but I wanted to be on record responding to this because if people are [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3466.66s)]
*  going to play clips from our podcast and go after our best foreign policy guy, I [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3469.9s)]
*  think there should be a response. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3474.18s)]
*  And honestly, if I just being completely honest, I think the work Scott Horton [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3475.3799999999997s)]
*  does is too important for him to need to waste his time with this. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3478.98s)]
*  So let me just handle it and then we can move on back to fixing the world. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3482.18s)]
*  OK, so here is the No Agenda podcast with Adam Curry as they start discussing [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3488.1s)]
*  the great Scott Horton. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3494.22s)]
*  Very it's kind of interesting because this again is more whining and moaning and [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3495.2599999999998s)]
*  groaning from NPR. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3499.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3503.06s)]
*  I said this week in Trump, I got some Scott Horton stuff. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3503.3799999999997s)]
*  Scott Horton stuff is interesting. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3506.1s)]
*  What do you want to do? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3507.7s)]
*  You want to do? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3508.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I've had enough NPR whining. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3508.74s)]
*  What's your idea? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3510.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, this is this guy. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3511.4199999999996s)]
*  Now, Scott, this is on a podcast. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3512.2599999999998s)]
*  This is Scott Horton, who's a writer. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3514.18s)]
*  He did this book called Provoked and Scott is a he's a lefty. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3516.02s)]
*  But he's a Trump's he voted for Trump because he got he says he's a and he's [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3521.06s)]
*  done a lot of books. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3526.62s)]
*  You look him up. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3527.4599999999996s)]
*  OK, so look, man. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3528.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm wrong and wrong. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3531.06s)]
*  Scott is not a lefty. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3534.1s)]
*  He did not vote for Donald Trump. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3535.2999999999997s)]
*  So you start this ago. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3536.94s)]
*  This is actually really interesting. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3538.1s)]
*  I just never quite understand these people who like they they launch into a [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3539.9s)]
*  topic on a podcast and they have not familiarized themselves with the most [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3545.2599999999998s)]
*  big like one Google search of Scott Horton. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3550.14s)]
*  And you'd be like, oh, he started the Libertarian Institute. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3552.94s)]
*  So like, OK, that you would probably find that out. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3557.2599999999998s)]
*  In fact, I think one of them is Googling as the other ones talking because they [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3559.94s)]
*  come to this in a second. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3563.0600000000004s)]
*  But just so you guys know, no, Scott is not a lefty. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3564.2200000000003s)]
*  No, Scott did not vote for Donald Trump. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3567.2200000000003s)]
*  Like both. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3569.42s)]
*  So you're just starting with you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3570.3s)]
*  Not the best start. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3574.02s)]
*  Let's keep playing. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3575.34s)]
*  On Amazon. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3577.5800000000004s)]
*  But he's a he votes for Trump because he thinks the left is doing nothing but [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3579.02s)]
*  lying to him and he sees it as such an insult. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3583.38s)]
*  He has the vote for Trump, even though he hates him. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3587.3s)]
*  The trolls are saying he's. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3590.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh, OK, so the trolls are saying he's a libertarian is the next line. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3592.26s)]
*  That's really funny that. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3595.1000000000004s)]
*  So someone corrects them there. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3595.82s)]
*  They didn't even Google it to find themselves. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3596.98s)]
*  Just one of their own listeners is like, the guy's a libertarian. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3598.78s)]
*  OK, first of all, just think about how brain did that. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3601.5s)]
*  So he goes, he's a lefty, but he voted for Trump because he says the left never [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3604.34s)]
*  stops lying to him. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3609.46s)]
*  Well, that doesn't really sound like the way lefties usually talk. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3610.7400000000002s)]
*  And no, he didn't vote for Donald Trump. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3613.5800000000004s)]
*  So you're because he voted for Donald Trump because you're already wrong because [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3615.1400000000003s)]
*  you just don't know what the fuck you're talking about. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3618.66s)]
*  There were some of us libertarians who broke and voted for Donald Trump. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3620.3799999999997s)]
*  I was one of them. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3624.18s)]
*  Scott was not. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3625.18s)]
*  So, you know, just know something before you come at some, especially before you [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3626.42s)]
*  come at someone as fucking brilliant as Scott Horton, know the first goddamn [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3632.18s)]
*  thing. It's amazing. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3636.46s)]
*  I understand going, hey, I'm not too familiar with this person. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3638.58s)]
*  Of course, of course. Let's get into what they said. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3641.62s)]
*  And we do that quite a bit, particularly me. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3643.94s)]
*  I'm more guilty of that when you bring something up. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3646.46s)]
*  Right now, literally right now. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3648.3s)]
*  I don't know anything about Adam Curry, but I'm not like coming out going like, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3649.6200000000003s)]
*  here's the problem with Adam Curry. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3652.7000000000003s)]
*  He's a Buchananite paleo conservative who voted for Bill Clinton because like none [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3654.6200000000003s)]
*  of that's true. And why would I just say that? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3660.5s)]
*  And to speak so authoritatively to go, I know that he's a leftist and he [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3662.6600000000003s)]
*  specifically voted for this reason. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3666.86s)]
*  Yeah, not even the humility to go like, like, I think the guy's a leftist. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3668.94s)]
*  I believe he voted for Donald Trump. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3673.3s)]
*  You're just saying it like these are the facts. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3674.9s)]
*  And you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3677.42s)]
*  It's so goddamn embarrassing. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3679.78s)]
*  All right, let's keep playing. Libertarian. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3681.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's what he calls himself. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3684.2200000000003s)]
*  OK, yeah. Libertarian by any libertarian. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3686.1s)]
*  Yes, he's a libertarian technically. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3689.26s)]
*  And he's one of those libertarian. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3691.62s)]
*  You know, I was everyone's a libertarian once in their life. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3693.42s)]
*  That's like, why isn't libertarian someone who doesn't want to admit they're a [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3695.98s)]
*  Republican? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3699.34s)]
*  Or or they don't want I don't know what they're looking back on. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3702.54s)]
*  I have no idea what a libertarian supposed to be. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3706.02s)]
*  It's like they want to legalize drugs and people should be [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3708.7s)]
*  free to have sex with whoever they want. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3713.58s)]
*  All right. So let's pause it. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3715.46s)]
*  I think that's the whole thing. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3716.46s)]
*  By the way, this is just just true in general and political commentary. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3717.82s)]
*  Whenever you say, you know, I have no idea. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3722.5s)]
*  I don't even know what I really even have no idea. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3725.42s)]
*  That's not the brag you think it is. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3728.1s)]
*  That's not really you're just saying you [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3730.5s)]
*  have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3732.46s)]
*  And so you're reduced to the most pathetic of straw man's of a libertarian [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3734.34s)]
*  is a Republican who doesn't want to admit that he's a Republican. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3739.38s)]
*  Oh, a libertarian. What did he say? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3742.42s)]
*  A libertarian. They just want to legalize drugs and say you should be you should be [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3743.82s)]
*  free to have sex with who you want to. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3748.0600000000004s)]
*  Well, like, yes, we do believe in in legalizing drugs. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3749.86s)]
*  That's not something Scott Horton has ever [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3753.34s)]
*  specialized or talked about too much, I don't think. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3755.26s)]
*  But that is true. That's the libertarian position. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3758.3s)]
*  We also have arguments for why we believe that's the case. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3760.1000000000004s)]
*  What is this comment about you should be free to have sex with whoever you want? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3762.94s)]
*  First of all, are you arguing people shouldn't be free to have sex with whoever [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3767.38s)]
*  they want? I mean, assuming we're not talking underage children here, obviously [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3770.94s)]
*  none of us agree with that. But are you arguing that like [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3774.1800000000003s)]
*  should orgies be illegal or should homosexuality be illegal? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3777.6200000000003s)]
*  Like, what's the counter argument to that? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3781.26s)]
*  Actually, that's not just a libertarian position. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3783.38s)]
*  That is just every American doesn't really believe. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3786.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, OK, outside the tiniest sliver of fringes, it's pretty much the consensus [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3789.74s)]
*  in America that voluntary sexual acts between consenting adults should be legal, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3796.14s)]
*  whether they should be praised or should be promoted might be more of a contentious [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3801.2999999999997s)]
*  issue, but should be like, what are you differentiating yourself? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3805.7799999999997s)]
*  No, no, no. All you're trying to do here is poison the well because you know nothing. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3808.8999999999996s)]
*  You don't know who you just found out the guy's a libertarian because one of your [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3814.22s)]
*  listeners told you that you didn't know who he voted for. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3818.3799999999997s)]
*  You know nothing. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3821.2599999999998s)]
*  So you'll just poison the well by being like, he's one of these sex freaks. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3822.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, he's one of whereas I challenge you. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3826.18s)]
*  Find me one example ever in the does. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3828.8999999999996s)]
*  I think Scott Horton, I think the Scott Horton show is up to 6000 episodes. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3832.7799999999997s)]
*  Like they've been doing he's been doing the show for a very long time. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3837.2599999999998s)]
*  And then all his interviews on all the other shows. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3839.4199999999996s)]
*  Scott Horton has done like [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3841.58s)]
*  a hundred thousand hours of podcasting. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3844.18s)]
*  He's written three incredible books. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3846.9s)]
*  Then he had a couple of other books that were like transcribed of podcast [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3850.1800000000003s)]
*  interviews in all of his work. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3853.5s)]
*  Find me one time where he talks about weird sex stuff. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3855.3s)]
*  That's your challenge. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3859.06s)]
*  He like there's just never a topic that's got he's a foreign policy specialist. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3860.1s)]
*  Occasionally, he'll do an interview about like other libertarian issues that he [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3864.26s)]
*  cares about. There's a few domestic issues that he's kind of known for. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3868.58s)]
*  Like he's known for being a real critic of Waco. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3871.58s)]
*  He was against burning babies alive, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3874.46s)]
*  Ruby Ridge, and he's talked about OKC a bit. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3876.9s)]
*  But like this sex, this is just nothing. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3880.1400000000003s)]
*  But like, let me just get you, let me get you to have a preconceived bias [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3882.94s)]
*  about who this guy is and here we're racing up against time. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3887.5s)]
*  So let's let's keep playing. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3890.78s)]
*  He's on CNN all the time. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3892.34s)]
*  I've never seen him before. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3894.26s)]
*  OK, maybe. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3895.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah, guys, Scott Horton is on CNN all the time. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3896.3s)]
*  Were you guys were you guys unaware of Scott's numerous CNN appearances? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3898.98s)]
*  Scott's never been on CNN. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3902.8599999999997s)]
*  He's not a leftist. He didn't vote for Trump. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3904.66s)]
*  He's never been on CNN. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3906.22s)]
*  Like at what point, by the way, if you're the other guys, if you're Adam Curry [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3907.46s)]
*  and you're listening to me respond to you right here, wouldn't this just be the point [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3911.3399999999997s)]
*  where you go, all right, I was kind of speaking out of my ass. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3915.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3918.9399999999996s)]
*  Like when you start with that, what was it? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3919.74s)]
*  You're just just objective claims. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3922.14s)]
*  Every single one of them wrong. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3924.2599999999998s)]
*  How about you don't know what the fuck you're talking about? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3925.7799999999997s)]
*  You brought up a guy who you know nothing [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3928.8199999999997s)]
*  about and you're pretending that you know anything about him. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3931.02s)]
*  Let's keep playing. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3934.06s)]
*  He might be. I don't watch CNN. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3935.62s)]
*  So let's listen to hear. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3937.58s)]
*  So he's got a lot of tidbits that are interesting. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3939.02s)]
*  And this is him on Kushner. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3941.3s)]
*  He was reaffirmed in that thinking. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3943.42s)]
*  I'm sorry. Wrong one. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3945.78s)]
*  Here we go on Kushner. Here we go. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3947.14s)]
*  And does Donald Trump know any reason why in the world he shouldn't just let Netanyahu, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3949.38s)]
*  as he said, quote, quote, finish the job is what he told Netanyahu the other day. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3953.82s)]
*  Well, what do you mean by that? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3959.7s)]
*  How about, well, we finished cleansing all of historic Palestine and we'll call it [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3960.9s)]
*  Greater Israel. How about that for finish the job? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3965.9s)]
*  And what does Donald Trump really care? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3968.5400000000004s)]
*  His son-in-law in I guess people don't know this. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3970.6200000000003s)]
*  Seems like they should talk about this every day all the time. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3974.38s)]
*  He's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3977.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, the guy who was in charge of his [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3978.94s)]
*  entire Middle East policy for four years is Benjamin Netanyahu's godson. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3980.26s)]
*  The whole time when he was a young boy [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3985.02s)]
*  growing up in New York City, when Benjamin Netanyahu would come to town, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3986.86s)]
*  he had to sleep on the couch because Benjamin Netanyahu would sleep in his bed. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3989.94s)]
*  Google that. Google it. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3994.1400000000003s)]
*  OK, that's who Jared Kushner is. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3996.7000000000003s)]
*  He's an Israeli agent. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=3998.86s)]
*  He's an Israeli Sionim. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4001.1000000000004s)]
*  He's here to represent the interests of a foreign power. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4003.78s)]
*  And he's got Donald Trump completely pwned like the gimp in the box on Pulp Fiction. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4006.86s)]
*  Pwned. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4013.02s)]
*  So Donald Trump can dress up like Pat Buchanan all he wants. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4014.82s)]
*  He's not Pat Buchanan. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4019.26s)]
*  He's a Zionist. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4021.7400000000002s)]
*  And when you're a Zionist, you can't be America first. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4022.9s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4025.82s)]
*  Hold on a second. They almost got our sponsor. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4028.98s)]
*  There was people losing their ever loving minds over Trump. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4030.82s)]
*  You know, so Netanyahu was signing something out. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4036.7000000000003s)]
*  They probably signed, you know, whoever is going to own Gaza or whatever. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4040.42s)]
*  And the president pulls out the chair and then pushes it in as Netanyahu. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4044.1800000000003s)]
*  Who sits down and the online rage when something like this. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4049.42s)]
*  Trump is Netanyahu's slave. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4054.82s)]
*  Let's pause it for a second here. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4057.26s)]
*  God, man, no agenda. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4058.86s)]
*  I mean, listen, I don't know about your I've never listened to your podcast. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4060.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying you have a bad podcast. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4063.94s)]
*  Maybe it's a good podcast. I don't know. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4065.5s)]
*  This is so goddamn cringy and embarrassing. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4067.0200000000004s)]
*  OK, Rob, this is how bad it is. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4070.2200000000003s)]
*  OK, because literally all the stuff I just said to you about how much they get it [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4071.6600000000003s)]
*  wrong and I didn't even really know. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4075.3s)]
*  So I'm listening to this clip first. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4077.1800000000003s)]
*  And then when I hear me start reading the ad, I'm like, oh, yeah, this was on our show. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4078.66s)]
*  I forgot I didn't even realize they were playing an episode from our show. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4082.2599999999998s)]
*  So now he responds and he goes, look, dude, this is what happens. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4084.9s)]
*  Trump has Netanyahu over. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4088.18s)]
*  He pulls the chair, puts it back in. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4090.14s)]
*  He says, hey, maybe we take over Gaza, floats out this idea. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4091.9s)]
*  And now everyone's losing their mind about how he's an Israeli. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4095.06s)]
*  Wrong. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4098.0599999999995s)]
*  I haven't had Trump on since that. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4099.54s)]
*  I haven't had Scott Horton on since Trump floated out that proposal. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4101.46s)]
*  That's not what we were talking about, dude. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4104.94s)]
*  You're wrong on every. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4108.3s)]
*  This isn't an opinion. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4109.780000000001s)]
*  It isn't like I think you got this wrong. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4111.1s)]
*  Objectively, you've gotten it all wrong so far. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4113.3s)]
*  All right. Now, if you wanted to pick apart one thing that's got Horton said there, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4116.740000000001s)]
*  you know, he's being hyperbolic, not literal. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4121.58s)]
*  So when he says he's his godson, Jews don't have godsons. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4123.9400000000005s)]
*  But you can read in The New York Times about how Jared Kushner got kicked out [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4127.900000000001s)]
*  of his own bed when Bibi Netanyahu came to stay at his house. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4132.5s)]
*  He's right about this. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4135.38s)]
*  So after you guys getting everything objectively wrong, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4136.54s)]
*  you just sit there and giggle through like this is what they're all ready. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4139.02s)]
*  It's another Jonah Goldberg. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4142.42s)]
*  They're reduced to being a 16 year old girl. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4143.86s)]
*  They just giggle through what he's saying. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4146.26s)]
*  They're not arguing with anything he said. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4148.1s)]
*  They're arguing that he's just reacting to Donald Trump's Gaza proposal. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4149.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, he's reacting to it three weeks before he made the proposal. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4154.9400000000005s)]
*  So how do you not just feel stupid? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4159.3s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4162.22s)]
*  Maybe there's some people out there who like the show. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4163.06s)]
*  Maybe they make some good points on some other things. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4164.54s)]
*  I have absolutely no idea. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4166.58s)]
*  I have nothing but respect for all former MTV VJs. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4167.9s)]
*  Long live the great Kennedy. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4172.66s)]
*  But this is embarrassing, dude. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4175.14s)]
*  You've got this all wrong objectively. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4178.18s)]
*  Let's just play the end of it and then I'm going to have to wrap up here. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4180.7s)]
*  Boy, look at him. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4184.18s)]
*  He's holding his chair for him. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4185.7s)]
*  I'm like, Trump, he's a hospitality guy. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4188.18s)]
*  He makes sure you have mints on your pillow at night. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4193.139999999999s)]
*  I'm sure that everyone's... [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4196.86s)]
*  Well, our take on this is from the get go is from the intelligence side, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4199.139999999999s)]
*  which is that we run Israel, they don't run us. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4204.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4208.339999999999s)]
*  And once you get past this, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4209.82s)]
*  this guy just always aspire for Israel, blah, blah, blah. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4211.74s)]
*  That's bull crap. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4215.0199999999995s)]
*  But if you want to believe that because you're a libertarian writer, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4216.78s)]
*  even though you don't even notice what you're writing, for example, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4220.78s)]
*  the book you just came out with, which was provoked. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4223.78s)]
*  Or if you're on Mastodon. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4226.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4227.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4229.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4230.9s)]
*  The book provoked is about how we [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4231.86s)]
*  provoked the Russians to take over Ukraine. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4235.26s)]
*  It's got all the stuff we've talked about on this show for years. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4238.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, the Maidan, the whole thing. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4241.46s)]
*  Well, you know, that's what a Zionist would say, John. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4243.82s)]
*  And so, yes, exactly. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4247.06s)]
*  And so the way these guys don't have to they don't know who they think the [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4249.54s)]
*  tails wagging the dog when no, no, the dog is wagging the tail. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4255.7s)]
*  So let's get over that. But OK, you can think what you want. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4258.9800000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile, what I thought was interesting, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4261.74s)]
*  just pause it real quick. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4263.78s)]
*  His only argument here is that he's not arguing with anything. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4264.66s)]
*  Scott actually said he's not really making an argument when he's saying the [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4267.46s)]
*  tails wagging the dog. No, actually, the dogs wagging the tail. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4270.7s)]
*  He's just saying that like America is [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4273.42s)]
*  controlling Israel, Israel isn't controlling America. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4275.3s)]
*  Again, you can't really debate with any of the specifics that Scott's arguing [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4277.94s)]
*  with here. And there are lots of examples where America is actually, you know, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4281.46s)]
*  to some degree, controlling Israel or exuding influence on Israel. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4285.9s)]
*  The elections, I think, in Gaza in 2005 was not a neocon Zionist project. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4289.299999999999s)]
*  I think that was much more of a [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4294.7s)]
*  Condoleezza Rice spreading democracy to the world type project. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4298.0599999999995s)]
*  There are examples where but there's clearly a million examples, too, of where, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4301.7s)]
*  no, actually, Israel has the tail has been wagging the dog. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4305.66s)]
*  And where there are presidents of the United States of America, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4309.22s)]
*  multiple presidents who want a certain policy done and cannot get their way [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4312.099999999999s)]
*  because actually Israel's influence is stronger than the presidents in some ways. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4316.099999999999s)]
*  So, again, all just not after getting everything wrong and not knowing what [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4320.9s)]
*  you're talking about. Now they're just making an assertion that's not even really [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4324.3s)]
*  a 100 percent correct assertion. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4327.9s)]
*  When he said Scott was just making the points of all the things they've talked [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4329.78s)]
*  about on the show and they've talked about made on it's like, OK, so [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4333.98s)]
*  Scott's also been making those points for many years before he wrote the book about it. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4338.94s)]
*  I don't again, that's just not a point. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4342.179999999999s)]
*  Then I guess you would say you agree on this. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4344.259999999999s)]
*  Anyway, let's keep playing. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4346.66s)]
*  Think from this guy, that thinks a little more. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4349.139999999999s)]
*  He's irked about Woodward, who is another spy agent, a spy. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4351.82s)]
*  Spook. Yes. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4358.86s)]
*  Pause it for a second. I thought this was worth. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4359.98s)]
*  Bob Woodward came from Naval Intelligence and as a young man in his 20s, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4361.7s)]
*  was given the Watergate story. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4367.18s)]
*  He was given the biggest story in the in the world as as a young [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4370.78s)]
*  20 something year old right out of Naval Intelligence. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4375.7s)]
*  Is it that crazy to refer to him as a spook or a spy? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4378.46s)]
*  I don't know. Again, they never have an argument. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4383.22s)]
*  It's always just a mocking tone of voice like that's let. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4386.54s)]
*  OK, I don't know any of the facts. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4390.42s)]
*  I don't have an argument, but I'm just going to kind of laugh through [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4392.66s)]
*  everything you say. Repeat back to you. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4396.62s)]
*  The name of the book is provoked. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4398.7s)]
*  Is that supposed to substitute for an intelligent thought? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4400.5s)]
*  Because it's not doing it for me. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4403.78s)]
*  All right, let's keep playing. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4405.78s)]
*  And then it's listening to and this is Scott provoked on Woodward as a two parter. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4406.860000000001s)]
*  He was reaffirmed in that thinking, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4412.860000000001s)]
*  watching the fall of Afghanistan and how indecisive Biden was in [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4415.54s)]
*  in finishing out the withdrawal. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4420.34s)]
*  He's talking about Putin. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4421.5s)]
*  Yeah, not withdrawing at all, but just botching it the way he did. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4422.54s)]
*  And, you know, the Bob Woodward book, the new Bob Woodward book [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4426.9800000000005s)]
*  has quotes from the high level intelligence officials saying that they assess that. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4430.7s)]
*  They even claimed, I think, to have sources in Russia [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4435.66s)]
*  saying this was part of their thinking was that Afghanistan [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4438.14s)]
*  made Biden look so weak that they thought, yeah, we can definitely press our advantage now. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4441.3s)]
*  But the problem is you got to throw out that whole Bob Woodward book [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4446.14s)]
*  because he's got a big fake quote of Sergey Lavrov on page 88. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4449.3s)]
*  And and then the whole book, the whole point of a Bob Woodward book [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4453.900000000001s)]
*  is he has quotes from people that nobody else can talk to. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4456.9800000000005s)]
*  But he gets interviews with. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4459.860000000001s)]
*  But so if he's lying about a quote that I can check on the OSCE website, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4461.54s)]
*  then what is he saying when he's quoting Blinken and Sullivan [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4466.3s)]
*  and the rest of these people? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4470.860000000001s)]
*  And like if they don't dispute all the quotes, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4472.66s)]
*  then I'm supposed to accept them or something. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4474.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know. I just can't. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4476.74s)]
*  I started to write a note in my book because I had actually, you know what, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4477.98s)]
*  then in that book, there's all kinds of quotes of Biden saying how right I am [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4481.54s)]
*  about everything. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4484.9s)]
*  Like I started quoting some good stuff in there. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4485.98s)]
*  And Averyl Haynes, the DNI, I had them admitting, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4488.0199999999995s)]
*  oh, yeah, Horton's right after all, blah, blah, blah, all over the place. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4491.379999999999s)]
*  And I had to cut all those quotes out. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4494.259999999999s)]
*  Once I got to the part where Woodward's lying to me, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4496.259999999999s)]
*  I started to write in the footnotes, well, you got to kind of take these [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4500.259999999999s)]
*  with a grain of salt. And then like, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4502.86s)]
*  I can't put quotes that you got to take with a grain of salt in the book. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4504.5s)]
*  We're like, I'm all right. I got to disclaim. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4507.62s)]
*  Even though he is the most prominent journalist in America, but like [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4509.58s)]
*  he just happened to have a quote in there. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4513.099999999999s)]
*  I and I happen to be writing a book about this. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4514.54s)]
*  I have the Lavrov quote already. I know what he said. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4517.0199999999995s)]
*  So when I read the live version of it, I'm like, hey, I know that quote. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4520.82s)]
*  And that's not right. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4525.26s)]
*  I can't wait to subscribe to this podcast. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4526.38s)]
*  Yeah. Riveting, riveting stuff. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4530.7s)]
*  Can you like maybe focus a little more instead of, you know, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4533.42s)]
*  dammering like that, but OK. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4536.54s)]
*  So the second part of it explains a little more in detail, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4538.58s)]
*  but then there's a kind of a kicker about Amazon taking his [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4541.42s)]
*  his commentary off the site. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4544.74s)]
*  And so it's it's page 88. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4547.06s)]
*  If anybody wants to check this out and also Amazon removed my review [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4548.9s)]
*  about this saying that I claimed I got an inauthentic copy of the book. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4552.54s)]
*  That's not what I said. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4556.5s)]
*  I said there's a fake quote on page 88. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4557.82s)]
*  So I had a great one star review on there and they took it down. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4560.34s)]
*  And there's now all the ones who are views are my book was torn or whatever. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4563.42s)]
*  And no criticism of the actual substance of the thing. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4566.78s)]
*  But if anyone wants to check, the quote is the playing with fire [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4569.9800000000005s)]
*  quote of Lavrov on page 88. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4573.5s)]
*  If anybody I'm not selling it, if anybody already has the New Woodward book [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4576.02s)]
*  and then go and check the OSCE websites from December, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4580.5s)]
*  pretty sure December 2nd, 2021, but certainly December 2021. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4583.82s)]
*  And you'll find the quote from Sergey Lavrov playing with fire. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4589.9s)]
*  And you'll see how Bob Woodward turns the meaning of the quote entirely upside down [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4592.46s)]
*  to he's saying essentially it's so reckless the way you guys completely [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4596.9s)]
*  disregard our opinion about your expansion of the NATO alliance. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4603.06s)]
*  And then they turn it butchers the quote into saying Lavrov is saying [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4607.78s)]
*  that America has no right to decide who should be in its alliance or not, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4612.06s)]
*  which, of course, makes no sense whatsoever because that's not what he said. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4617.14s)]
*  The whole thing is stupid. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4620.46s)]
*  But anyway, point just being you can't trust Bob Woodward to tell you a quote right. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4621.38s)]
*  Wow. OK, that was revealing season of reveal. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4625.62s)]
*  Well, of course, we've been saying this for what? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4631.1s)]
*  Since day one, since since legacy of wood, not legacy of ashes, but [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4634.1s)]
*  family of secrets. Yes, family of secrets. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4639.78s)]
*  That's right. Which was brought out that Bob Woodward came out of [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4641.900000000001s)]
*  that was Navy intelligence, I think. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4645.26s)]
*  And basically. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4647.9400000000005s)]
*  I thought you just mocked the idea of calling him a spook or a spy. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4649.82s)]
*  Am I miss? So that's your criticism after all of that. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4652.54s)]
*  Scott Worden is sitting here on our show. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4655.46s)]
*  By the way, yeah, you should subscribe to the show. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4657.179999999999s)]
*  You could learn something. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4658.94s)]
*  It's I know it's you don't like when people are ranting or something like that. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4660.66s)]
*  I'm sorry. We're not just making bullshit up and claiming [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4664.179999999999s)]
*  we know stuff about people and are objectively wrong. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4667.219999999999s)]
*  Scott's going literally what he's saying here is just talking about [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4670.259999999999s)]
*  what a meticulous like writer he is and how he's an honest enough actor [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4673.94s)]
*  that he goes, look, there was this Bob Woodward book that had all these great [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4678.86s)]
*  quotes that was like proving my case. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4682.42s)]
*  He goes, but then I found this one Sergey Lavrov quote, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4684.66s)]
*  and he's totally lying about it. And so here's the real one. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4687.259999999999s)]
*  Here's the one. And then he goes, once he does that, I can't use any of these [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4690.339999999999s)]
*  because I can't trust you're not a liar. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4692.86s)]
*  And their big critique at the end of that is just we've been saying [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4694.259999999999s)]
*  he was a liar for a long time. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4697.78s)]
*  OK, fine. So you've been saying it for a long time. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4700.54s)]
*  And now someone far smarter than you, who's a far better researcher, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4702.9s)]
*  is saying it to more people. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4706.58s)]
*  Seems like a win. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4708.54s)]
*  Listen, I'll say this. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4710.26s)]
*  You don't have to subscribe to the podcast, but no agenda guys. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4711.3s)]
*  Open invite. If you want to come on the show, we can argue about Scott Horton [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4713.86s)]
*  or any of this stuff if you want to. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4717.66s)]
*  But just do a little bit of research first. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4718.98s)]
*  Get a few facts down, because otherwise you're going to get embarrassed. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4721.22s)]
*  Anyway, sorry. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4724.38s)]
*  I just can't have people coming at my guy, Scott Horton, like that, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4725.58s)]
*  especially when they have nothing. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4728.74s)]
*  It's amazing, Rob, that people will do a segment about that stuff like this [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4730.54s)]
*  and have nothing. All right. We're way over time. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4733.42s)]
*  I got to wrap. We're back. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4735.66s)]
*  Thank you guys all for watching, listening, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4737.3s)]
*  and we'll catch you tomorrow with a brand new episode. Peace. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxglsAzr5k&t=4739.9s)]
