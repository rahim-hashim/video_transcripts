# Dave Smith | The Funeral of Ben Shapiro | Part Of The Problem 1277
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0)
*  Hello, hello, hello. What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=0.0s)]
*  the Problem. I am Dave Smith, Roland Solo for this episode, but it's going to be a fun one. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=11.24s)]
*  Okay, so a couple points of business before we get into today's show. Number one, this [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=17.6s)]
*  weekend, Friday and Saturday night, I will be at the Dojo of Comedy right here in New [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=23.04s)]
*  Jersey. If you're in the New York, New Jersey area, come on out to the shows. There are [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=28.12s)]
*  still some tickets available. I don't perform in New Jersey or New York area that much these [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=32.08s)]
*  days. I'm always on the road or just podcasting. So if you can come on out, come on out. We're [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  going to hang out. I'm going to take pictures afterward and stuff. So come on out, meet [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=41.86s)]
*  me, come see some comedy. It's going to be a fun time. I got Scott Chaplin and Louis [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=46.24s)]
*  J. Gomez on the show with me. So really looking forward to this weekend. My favorite way to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=50.84s)]
*  do comedy is when I get to sleep in my own bed at night. So this is a big, big win for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  me. The other piece of news is that I just debated Constantine Kassin on the Piers Morgan [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=61.31999999999999s)]
*  show, Uncensored. And we just finished, literally just got off there and jumped on here. That's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=69.32s)]
*  why we're a little bit late starting the show. So that should be out either later today or [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=74.44s)]
*  tomorrow. And then tonight I'm recording another debate for Zero Hedge that I believe is coming [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=78.84s)]
*  out tomorrow. Of course, both the debates are on the topic of war and Iran. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=83.88s)]
*  OK, so this is a big day. This is a big day for part of the problem. It's a big day for this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  show. Sometimes you're searching for something for years and years and then you finally get it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  And it really, you know, sometimes it's not as rewarding once you get it. Sometimes it's even [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  more rewarding. Without further ado, let's go to Ben Shapiro. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  Dave Smith, another one of these. He came out yesterday that Trump should be impeached. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=110.12s)]
*  Pause it already. Said my name. Finally, after all these years, Ben Shapiro has made so many [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=116.68s)]
*  videos going at me. It is never once mentioned by name. And now finally, here we are. Dave, I [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=124.56s)]
*  have officially made it. The most influential conservative voice in America, Ben Shapiro, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=130.08s)]
*  finally learned the name. It really means a lot to me, Ben. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=136.72s)]
*  I know it took a lot of effort. It took a lot of effort to memorize a name like Dave. It's tricky. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=141.6s)]
*  Obviously, it took all of us some time. I have family members who still can't remember. Dave Smith. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  Very tricky. I understand. Finally, Ben Shapiro had the balls to utter my name into the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  universe. However, there is a problem with that, Ben, because now I'm going to destroy you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=158.88s)]
*  Welcome to the funeral of Ben Shapiro, everybody. Let's keep playing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  Full on impeached for the crime of for the crime of defenestrating one of the worst regimes on the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=170.0s)]
*  planet without firing a shot. That's the big mistake, according to now, I will say, Dave Smith, I [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=175.48s)]
*  will say he was consistent a while ago, then he was inconsistent, then he was consistent again. So [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  if you go back a couple of years, he was calling for Donald Trump to be impeached. And he voted for [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=184.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, apparently. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Pause it. Whoa, wait a minute. So now not only do you know my name, you're familiar with my [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  history. You're familiar with where I was years ago and where I am today. And then in all those [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=194.88s)]
*  videos, you just referred to me as the comedian, Tucker Carlson's guest, Joe Rogan's guest. But you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=200.27999999999997s)]
*  know where I stood on the issues years ago. Jesus, man. What is it was that it was that hard to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=206.72s)]
*  remember Dave Smith? Well, listen, hey, I don't want to beat you up over old stuff. We got here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=213.32s)]
*  And you know the name now. Now, of course, he's saying that I was arguing that Donald Trump [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=218.64s)]
*  should be impeached for defending this evil regime without firing a single shot. No, what I said is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=225.4s)]
*  that Donald Trump should be impeached and removed for getting the United States of America into yet [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=234.28s)]
*  another war in the Middle East, which was his entire mandate not to do. And I know, for Ben [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  Shapiro logic, he'll say, Oh, America's not at war. That's that's right. We're with you know what? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=245.56s)]
*  The thing is, remember how Iran was guilty of attacking Israel on October 7th? Ben Shapiro. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  Remember that? Because Hamas is their proxy. Well, our proxy Israel just bombed the crap out of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=257.32s)]
*  Iran with our bombs. Well, we gave them diplomatic cover and then take out the missiles headed back [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=265.08s)]
*  in their directions. So yeah, I'd consider that taking us into a war in the Middle East. And don't [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=272.2s)]
*  tell me anything about how Iran is the most brutal evil regime, please. As the government of Israel [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=276.84s)]
*  has slaughtered far more innocent people destroyed the lives of far more innocent people than Iran [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=282.76s)]
*  could ever dream to. Not that they wouldn't. They're not the best guys. They just don't have [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  the opportunity and Israel does. Um, but you know what Ben Shapiro makes a point, he criticizes me [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=292.2s)]
*  for my lack of consistency. Imagine imagine a world where Ben Shapiro can look at me and say, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=298.52s)]
*  I was inconsistent. By the way, here, Natalie, do we have that tweet? Let's pull this. This hasn't [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=306.44s)]
*  been deleted. The imagine making this argument when you still have this tweet out and have not [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  deleted it. Oh, here. Okay, let's see what he said. Shapiro. I will never know. Hold on. Let's pull up [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=318.76s)]
*  the his words at the top. I will never vote for Donald Trump. Here's why. Ben Shapiro. I stand [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=324.2s)]
*  against the establishment that sowed the seeds of Trumpism. I stand against the Republican party [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  that insists that victory matters more than principle because victory without principle [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=338.44s)]
*  isn't just meaningless. It's counterproductive to my belief system. Hashtag never Trump. Who do you [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=342.76s)]
*  think you're fooling Ben Shapiro? You were a never Trump or who came around and supported [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=351.88s)]
*  Donald Trump. You're going to talk to me about my, it, my inconsistency because I criticized, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=356.52s)]
*  I've been the same on the issues the entire time. The only thing you could claim inconsistent is [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=362.6s)]
*  that like I voted for a guy and then said, ah, man, I probably shouldn't have done that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=367.96s)]
*  Okay, fine. I didn't, I didn't change my principles. Now did I? Right. I thought for you, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=373.16s)]
*  for you not supporting Donald Trump was all about principles. Okay. And then, oh, I guess [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=380.76s)]
*  you never really had those principles. Talk to me about a lack of consistency. You are the biggest [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=386.52s)]
*  hypocrite in the United States of America. You rose to prominence opposing identity politics [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=392.44s)]
*  as a proud Zionist. Your entire existence is a contradiction. The nerve, the nerve of Ben Shapiro [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=399.56s)]
*  challenged me on my consistency. Does he not know? Okay. He's learned my name. Now the next step [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=408.12s)]
*  is to learn my nickname. Uh, my nickname is the most consistent motherfucker, you know, Ben Shapiro. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  All right, let's go back to the video. Let's go back to hear what Benny boys got to say. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=421.24s)]
*  And then he's calling for Donald Trump to be impeached again. So here he is back to being [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=427.16s)]
*  captain and people. Don't worry. He too is apparently America first means Iran must have [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=430.6s)]
*  a nuclear weapon and America can do nothing. And if you disagree with that, then you are not [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=435.16s)]
*  America first. You know, there's just some guy like president Trump who's in an, I mean, come on, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=439.0s)]
*  this is why Ben Shapiro is falling apart and losing all of his influence and just constantly [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=445.48s)]
*  being mocked to even has his top guys at daily wire are basically going against him as much as [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=449.24s)]
*  they're allowed to. Um, being America first means that around must be allowed to have a nuclear [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=455.8s)]
*  weapon. Again, it's like arguing being, being anti-war means you're going to let Saddam Hussein [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=462.6s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon. A Ram does not have a nuclear weapon. All of our intelligence backs [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  this up literally since 2007, the CIA has been saying they don't have a nuke and they're not [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  pursuing a nuke this year. The director of national intelligence released the annual threat report [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=479.56s)]
*  two months ago. What did she find? A Ram does not have a nuclear weapon and they are not pursuing [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=485.48s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. The entire international community has conceded the same thing. They [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=491.16s)]
*  don't have new, this is a figment of your imagination or otherwise known as a pretense [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  for a regime change war, which the Israelis and the neo conservatives have openly admitted for [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=501.8s)]
*  30 years has been their goal, overthrowing the Iranian regime. Tell me something, uh, Ben Shapiro [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=508.36s)]
*  when Netanyahu said in 1992 that Iran was one to three years away from a nuke. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=516.0400000000001s)]
*  And then when he said they were one to three years away from a nuke again and again and again [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=523.08s)]
*  and again for 30 years, 35, whatever the math and that is 33, 34 years, when he, when he was saying [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=528.76s)]
*  that, was he mistaken? Was he wrong? Or was he trying to lie my country into another war, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=537.32s)]
*  just like he did with Iraq and Libya and Syria? Which one do you think? See, I tend to think it's [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=545.6400000000001s)]
*  the latter. No, America first doesn't mean around this non-existent around gets nuclear weapons that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=552.6s)]
*  you just make up. Like every goddamn war is sold on these bullshit lies. America first means we [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=560.2800000000001s)]
*  don't go to war on behalf of other countries, but you wouldn't know about that because you're not [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=567.24s)]
*  America first. As we all know, you're Israel first, which is fine. Just be that at least admit it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=575.0s)]
*  See, being America first to me means that I don't celebrate when Bashar al-Assad is ousted in Syria [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=582.76s)]
*  and the Emir of Al-Qaeda is put into power. I don't celebrate because, oh, we broke up the Shiite [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=591.24s)]
*  crescent and now Iran can't move weapons into Hezbollah. That, because that's Israel's problem. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=598.36s)]
*  I'm an American, so my beef is with Al-Qaeda because they hit us on 9-11 and killed thousands [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=606.2s)]
*  of my fellow countrymen. To me, I would say, yeah, that's what America first means. Yeah, I would say [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=612.2s)]
*  that and I'm quite happy to take that position. I'm sorry. It's just unbelievable. There's all [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=617.72s)]
*  these people out there. Iran is the number one sponsor of terrorism. What terrorism exactly? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=624.6800000000001s)]
*  Because terrorism is a big problem. Here in the West, we've had major problems with Al-Qaeda and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=631.72s)]
*  ISIS. Does Iran support Al-Qaeda and ISIS? Oh, no, that's right. They fight wars against them. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  They fight wars against them. Let's see, Ben Shapiro celebrates when Bashar al-Assad falls [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=645.4s)]
*  because now Hezbollah won't get weapons anymore. Hey, someone do a quick Google search for me. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=650.12s)]
*  When was the last time Hezbollah attacked the United States of America? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=657.88s)]
*  That's right. Yet you see, Hezbollah is a real threat. They are a real threat, or at least they [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=662.6s)]
*  were until they were taken out. Now, what is that threat? Oh, yeah, they're a threat to Israel's [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=669.72s)]
*  ability to occupy southern Lebanon because they kicked their pussy asses out of there. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=675.32s)]
*  Unbelievable. What does America first mean? You're right, Ben Shapiro. America first means [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=682.0400000000001s)]
*  fighting wars on behalf of Israel. Okay, you take that line and we'll see who wins this argument [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=685.88s)]
*  with the people. Let's keep playing. Agree with that, then you are not America first. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=690.44s)]
*  They're just some guy like President Trump who's an anonymous rando. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=699.8s)]
*  I mean, what an impotent leader to be sitting there talking about coming back to the negotiating [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=703.96s)]
*  table. It's like sitting after Pearl Harbor and telling FDR, now's the time to go negotiate with [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=709.48s)]
*  the Japanese. Negotiations are over now. The time for negotiations was before this. And so, yeah, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=714.92s)]
*  Donald Trump looks and man, I supported him this last year. I apologize for doing so. It was a bad [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=721.16s)]
*  calculation at the time. It seemed like the right one, but he should be impeached and removed for [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=727.0s)]
*  this one. Okay. And then just to follow that up, Dave Smith went on Twitter and then he called the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=732.2s)]
*  president of the United States, quote, the most impotent of a leader imaginable. He's allowing one [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=737.16s)]
*  side of a war who clearly wants to drag us into lie about our involvement while not correcting the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=742.2s)]
*  record. Trump has betrayed MAGA and every principle of America first. He is no longer worthy of any [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=745.72s)]
*  of our support. He probably never was, as Dave Smith. So just going to point out once again, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=750.44s)]
*  these are the people who believe they should be in control of MAGA. Do you agree with that? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=754.2s)]
*  77 million Americans voted for Donald Trump. Some of us campaigned for Donald Trump. Some of us gave [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=757.4000000000001s)]
*  money to Donald Trump. I'm one of those people. And you know what I voted for? This. And you know [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=761.1600000000001s)]
*  who represents that view? Yeah, of course you did, Ben Shapiro. No one's disagreeing with that, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=768.2800000000001s)]
*  Ben Shapiro. Obviously you voted for him. Listen, how pathetic is this? How pathetic is this? Is that [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=776.2800000000001s)]
*  Ben Shapiro thinks that this is, and look, I get what he's doing here. I think you all probably do [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=782.28s)]
*  too, right? Is that he knows it's Donald Trump and he knows I'm criticizing Donald Trump. So now he [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=787.24s)]
*  can come out and just be like, I'm on Trump's side against these guys like Dave C audience. Aren't [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=792.52s)]
*  you with me? That's the only, the first time he mentions my name is when he thinks he can use [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=798.28s)]
*  Trump against me. Again, the problem is that Ben Shapiro, you were a never Trump or on principal, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=803.0799999999999s)]
*  right? I never said I was pro Trump on any, but I just said, I don't know, all things considered. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=811.8s)]
*  I think we're better off with him than we are with Kamala Harris. So let's push for that. That's it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=817.96s)]
*  My principles have not wavered on this thing. Look, the idea that yes, obviously Ben Shapiro, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=824.28s)]
*  you voted for this. Yes, you did. You know, by the way, there was some recent polling that just came [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=830.44s)]
*  out today. Did you know there's not one demographic of Americans that support war with Iran? Not one, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=835.8s)]
*  not blacks, not whites, not Latinos, not senior citizens, not the gen Z gen X millennial, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=843.0799999999999s)]
*  not one demographic supports war with Iran, which we are already in and dangerously close to [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=849.4799999999999s)]
*  major escalations right now. So you could sit here and say, oh, these guys think they should be in [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=856.92s)]
*  charge of MAGA. Is that really what you want? I don't know, Ben Shapiro fighting wars on behalf [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=862.28s)]
*  of Israel is an America first. So yeah, that's what I want. I want a president who, while everyone, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=869.56s)]
*  all of his supporters were bragging about how there were no new wars under his watch the first [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=875.64s)]
*  time. That's what I'd like. I'd like to not get involved in more wars, especially ones based off [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=881.4s)]
*  bullshit lies by people like you who have pushed all the lies for all of these disastrous wars. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=887.88s)]
*  Ben Shapiro, I mean, come on, the guy doesn't, you know, the thing about it is, is that he, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=894.84s)]
*  he doesn't believe in anything other than the cause of Israel. It's the only thing he actually [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=899.4s)]
*  believes that Ben Shapiro, you know, he, he was tweeting that what was it that, um, his, his old [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=906.2s)]
*  tweet about how Arabs like to play in mud and blow stuff up. And then he went on to apologize [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=912.2s)]
*  for that kind of inconsistent, if you ask me, but what did he really mean? Did he mean the apology? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=918.2s)]
*  I don't think he did. I think he meant it the first time when he said it, you know, there's a [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=925.72s)]
*  guy who won't even tell you what he really thinks because he's trying to trick you into supporting [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=930.12s)]
*  a policy that he knows if he actually told you what he wanted, you would never support him. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=934.36s)]
*  That's who Ben Shapiro is. Now let me tell you something. I remember Ben Shapiro from the, the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=939.08s)]
*  first time Ben Shapiro ever came on my radar was in 2012 when Ron Paul was running for president [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=945.8000000000001s)]
*  and he attacked him in the most vicious way, the most vicious way, the guy who was against all of [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=951.4000000000001s)]
*  the terror wars from the very beginning, the guy who was against the Patriot act from the very [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=957.24s)]
*  beginning, the guy who got everything right while Ben Shapiro got everything wrong. He called him an [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=961.8000000000001s)]
*  anti-Semite and a racist and a loon and all these things. Never went back and apologized, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=966.28s)]
*  never corrected the record. That's who this guy is. There, let's keep playing. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=971.24s)]
*  And you know what I voted for? This. And you know who represents that view? The President of the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=978.8399999999999s)]
*  United States, who on the afternoon of June 17th put out on Truth Social the following statement, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=985.0799999999999s)]
*  all capital letters, unconditional surrender, exclamation point. So is that not America first? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=993.48s)]
*  Or it wasn't America first when America asked for the unconditional surrender of Japan. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1002.04s)]
*  It wasn't America first when America sought to end. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1006.28s)]
*  I mean, how pathetic, how pathetic is it? Oh, okay. So you're bragging on one hand that he's [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1011.5600000000001s)]
*  decapitated Iran without firing a single shot and then also boasting that he's demanding [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1019.32s)]
*  unconditional surrender. Okay, let me, if you want to argue that demanding unconditional [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1025.24s)]
*  surrender from Japan was America first somehow, that anybody who's familiar with the history of [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1030.84s)]
*  the term America first, think about the inversion of language here. That was America first demanding [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1037.16s)]
*  an unconditional surrender from Japan, by the way, against the wishes of five star general Dwight D [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1042.44s)]
*  Eisenhower, who didn't want us to drop the nukes, thought it would be horrifically inhumane and [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1047.96s)]
*  completely unnecessary and that Japan was willing to negotiate a surrender anyway. Best is a five [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1052.2s)]
*  star general though. I mean, what does he know? Next up, Ben Shapiro. But so that's it. So we're [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1057.56s)]
*  demanding an unconditional surrender. Well, one thing I would, I'd say that demanding an [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1063.88s)]
*  unconditional surrender from Japan and now demanding an unconditional surrender from Iran, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1071.72s)]
*  well, does seem to imply that America's at war now, doesn't it? Usually parties who aren't at war [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1079.64s)]
*  don't demand unconditional surrenders from the other. By the way, you know, like there's so much [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1088.52s)]
*  here that it's just so ridiculous, the war propaganda, because you have to understand, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1094.84s)]
*  right? Like in the worldview of the war hawks, this is just like World War II. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1098.84s)]
*  Every single war is just like World War II, but it's nothing like the wars in the last 25 years. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1106.28s)]
*  You understand that, right? Going to war with Iran has very little in common with Iraq and [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1111.1599999999999s)]
*  Afghanistan and Libya and Syria and Somalia and Yemen or Niger or Pakistan. There's very little [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1116.1999999999998s)]
*  in common with that, but it's just like World War II. You see that? There's a slight difference, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1122.6s)]
*  you know, a couple, I would say. You know, I mean, this isn't the type of thing that will ever stop [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1128.04s)]
*  Ben Shapiro from supporting a war, but Japan attacked us. That was a big part of the calculation [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1135.0s)]
*  before we demanded that unconditional surrender now, wasn't it? Like forget even getting into [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1141.96s)]
*  the stuff about how FDR knew that Pearl Harbor was coming and probably kind of lured them into [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1146.28s)]
*  it. Forget all of that for a second. They attacked us. They attacked us and killed Americans, okay? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1150.36s)]
*  Like Iran has not. Iran has not attacked the United States of America, neither has Hezbollah [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1156.76s)]
*  or Hamas or the Houthis. If they've done anything, it's been when America's intervened in their part [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1163.0s)]
*  of the world on behalf of Israel. But yes, of course, because, but even if you were going to [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1170.04s)]
*  argue, so because in Ben Shapiro's mind, you know, World War II was America first, by the way, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1175.48s)]
*  just to be clear, so everybody knows back in that tweet that we pulled up from 2016 when Ben Shapiro [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1182.76s)]
*  was a never Trumper and said that Donald Trump represented the biggest threat to the United [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1189.16s)]
*  States of America and was supporting Ted Cruz for that all the way through the primaries. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1193.16s)]
*  And back then, when America first started being used as a slogan, Ben Shapiro opposed it because [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1197.0800000000002s)]
*  he said it was anti-Semitic. But tell me about my inconsistency. Ben Shapiro said that America [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1203.16s)]
*  first was an anti-Semitic term because it's the term that was used by people who didn't want to [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1211.88s)]
*  fight World War II. And as we all know, that means you're pro-Holocaust and hate the Jews. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1216.8400000000001s)]
*  If you were at the time opposed to what became the biggest bloodbath in human history, the worst thing [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1221.64s)]
*  that's ever happened in the history of the world, if you were against that, well, that just means [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1227.5600000000002s)]
*  you hate Jews. But now he's trying to weaponize the term America first to point out that what, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1231.72s)]
*  that actually going to war with Iran is America first. Is that what it means? America first means [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1237.64s)]
*  another catastrophic war in the Middle East against a country who poses absolutely no threat to us. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1245.48s)]
*  Okay. Good luck with that one, Ben Shapiro. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1250.36s)]

*  Trump hit Qasem Soleimani because he self-appointed. Pause. Maga. I'm sorry, pause it and rewind it just [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1352.44s)]
*  a little bit there, Natalie. I apologize, but we're going to have to get back to the other point. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1358.6000000000001s)]
*  Did he just use the Gulf War as an example of an America first policy? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1364.76s)]
*  I'm actually blown away by this. This is further, by the way, this is further than I made it in the [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1376.04s)]
*  video. I haven't seen these arguments yet. We're all doing this together in real time. I saw that [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1380.36s)]
*  he mentioned my name and I went, well, I know what I'm doing on the show today. And then listen for [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1384.28s)]
*  like 30 more seconds. And I was like, oh, this is dumber than I thought. But I did not know this was [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1388.12s)]
*  coming. The Gulf War was America first. So let me get this straight. Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1392.36s)]
*  over a slant drilling dispute over debt left over from his war against Iran [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1403.8799999999999s)]
*  in which he used chemical weapons against the Iranian people. And the U.S. backed him in that [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1411.56s)]
*  war. Actually backed both sides of that war if you want to really get the details right. But you [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1418.36s)]
*  know about that. Now don't you Ben Shapiro? So he invades with a wink and a nod, by the way, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1422.6799999999998s)]
*  from the United States of America invades Kuwait. We go in to fight on behalf of Kuwait to liberate [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1428.1999999999998s)]
*  the democracy of Kuwait. What's the, they're, they're, they're a mirror represented the will [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1438.1999999999998s)]
*  of the people or something like that. But you're going to what that was America first. Like, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1446.68s)]
*  I listen, I know I actually mentioned this recently on the show, but it's almost like [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1450.92s)]
*  to Ben Shapiro just revert back to a 1992 talking point, because you know, the talking point [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1455.3200000000002s)]
*  after the Gulf War was that, oh, this was so successful and so great. And we took no casualties [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1462.3600000000001s)]
*  and our boys didn't even get injured. It didn't cost us that much money. And the world is better. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1467.48s)]
*  You know, the global order is better with Saddam, not in Kuwait. That was the talking point in 1992. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1472.36s)]
*  The problem is that we were bogged down in Iraq for the next 30 years. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1479.8799999999999s)]
*  You don't get to brag about that anymore. That was what popped off the whole beef with Saddam [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1486.6s)]
*  Hussein that led to Bill Clinton's bombing campaigns and sanctions campaigns. And then of [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1491.8s)]
*  course, ultimately, George W. Bush ended up invading and overthrowing Saddam. And then we [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1497.16s)]
*  spent the next 20 years doing this regime change insanity, something in the neighborhood of a [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1501.96s)]
*  million people died, something I think like 15 million people were displaced and it cost America [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1507.0s)]
*  about $2 trillion. So yeah, I would say that was an America first. I am stunned that Ben Shapiro, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1511.96s)]
*  like the World War Two example, I understand that's what these hacks always go to. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1523.4s)]
*  But the Gulf War. OK, all right, let's keep playing. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1528.44s)]
*  The Gulf War by pushing Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. It wasn't America first when President [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1535.3200000000002s)]
*  Trump hit Qasem Soleimani because these self appointed mega priests get to decide, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1541.16s)]
*  not the president of the United States. Well, Donald Trump had one more comment about [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1547.24s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, who's asked specifically about Tucker's take. He said, you know what, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1551.56s)]
*  maybe you should get a TV network and then talk and then maybe be. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1554.76s)]
*  Yeah, let me pause it one second, but try to try to pull back because I want to respond to this [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1558.04s)]
*  Tucker part as well. Listen, this is so bizarre. But like, I he's saying that people like me. Yes, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1561.56s)]
*  killing Soleimani was a terrible decision. And it really risked a further conflict with Iran. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1571.24s)]
*  There's a terrible decision to take him out and it didn't do anything to degrade Iran's capability. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1577.24s)]
*  By the way, the only thing that it's funny, by the way, isn't it? I should just mention this. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1584.44s)]
*  Isn't it funny that Ben Shapiro, when he's trying to battle me, right, like he's trying to battle [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1590.1200000000001s)]
*  an anti war guy who is criticizing the president for leading us into a war. Now, just to be clear, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1596.36s)]
*  when Donald Trump was running for president the first time and was saying to Jeb Bush, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1603.88s)]
*  your brother lied us into a war in Iraq, that was a big fat mistake. We shouldn't do that anymore. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1610.7600000000002s)]
*  That's when Ben Shapiro's never Trump. That's when Ben Shapiro's like, screw this guy. I have [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1618.5200000000002s)]
*  my principles and I'll never cave on my principles. But now, because I'm consistent and actually have [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1623.64s)]
*  principles and I'm criticized, now he's taking me on. He's like, this guy's claiming to speak for [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1629.8s)]
*  MAGA. First of all, I never claimed to speak for MAGA. Dude, I don't even claim to speak for [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1634.28s)]
*  the libertarians. Have you met the libertarians? No one speaks for them. I don't speak for anyone. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1638.68s)]
*  I speak for myself. I speak for people who choose to agree with me, I suppose. But I'm not claiming [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1644.04s)]
*  to speak for MAGA. I'm just, I know it's foreign to you, Ben, because you write about having [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1651.32s)]
*  principles, but this is what having principles actually means. I oppose this and so I'm speaking [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1655.64s)]
*  out against it and I'm trying to persuade others that I'm correct and that they should oppose it [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1660.76s)]
*  as well. That's not me hijacking MAGA. But isn't it interesting in this moment when Ben Shapiro [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1665.48s)]
*  finally works up the courage to utter my name and he wants to take me on. Again, the examples we get [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1671.0s)]
*  are World War II and the Persian Gulf War. Those are the examples that he'll give. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1677.5600000000002s)]
*  Excuse me, the Gulf War. Now, why is it we've had some much more recent wars that Ben Shapiro [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1685.1599999999999s)]
*  supported. Why didn't he bring up any of those? Hmm. Well, that's a mystery. I mean, I might [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1691.9599999999998s)]
*  scratch right through my hair into my brain trying to figure out why it would be that Ben Shapiro [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1699.8s)]
*  wouldn't use examples of more recent wars that he was a cheerleader for. Oh, yeah, that's right, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1705.6399999999999s)]
*  because they were all unmitigated disasters where millions of people died and trillions of [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1713.64s)]
*  dollars were wasted. You know what's not America first? Ben Shapiro is spending eight trillion [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1718.76s)]
*  dollars on regime change wars. It's not America first when we're sitting here with our bravest [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1724.0400000000002s)]
*  young men from the last generation with their limbs blown off, swallowing pistols by the tens [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1730.6000000000001s)]
*  of thousands. Yeah, I wouldn't consider that America first, but tell me again how it's just [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1736.3600000000001s)]
*  like World War Two. All right, let's get into the Tucker Carlson stuff. Not the President of the [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1741.48s)]
*  United States? Well, Donald Trump had one more comment about Tucker Carlson who's asked specifically [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1748.3600000000001s)]
*  about Tucker's take. He said, you know what, maybe you should get a TV network and then talk and then [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1753.56s)]
*  maybe people listen. I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying. Let him go get a television [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1757.16s)]
*  network and say it so that people listen. Thank you. All right, we can we can we'll go back to that [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1762.68s)]
*  in a second, but let me I mean it's so funny. It's so transparent. Ben Shapiro is so transparently [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1770.68s)]
*  dishonest and to look I mean what's going on here? This is so I mean this is by the way of all the [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1777.4s)]
*  terror wars this is the most blatant because you had to be paying attention to know that Iraq was [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1785.48s)]
*  that we fought the war in Iraq on behalf of Israel. You had to be paying attention to know that like [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1792.68s)]
*  overthrowing Momar Gaddafi or overthrowing Bashar al-Assad that you know you had to be [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1797.4s)]
*  paying attention and reading stuff to know that that was all because Israel had been pushing [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1804.76s)]
*  America into those wars. But you don't even if you're paying attention at all you know this is a war [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1809.16s)]
*  for Israel. Okay, like Israel's even the one saying they they sold weapons to the people who did [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1814.0400000000002s)]
*  October 7th and they were selling weapons to Hezbollah and the Houthi like Israel's the one [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1821.16s)]
*  launching the strikes to begin with. We'll see that may not be true by the end of this podcast, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1827.48s)]
*  but we'll see. But so what's going on here? Tucker Carlson is opposing America fighting a war on [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1831.96s)]
*  Israel's behalf and that's why Ben Shapiro must attack him right? Isn't that just so transparently [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1839.64s)]
*  obvious that Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson were cool. They did shows together. They did lots of [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1845.48s)]
*  stuff. It wasn't until Ben Shapiro excuse me until Tucker Carlson became critical of America [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1850.44s)]
*  funding and arming Israel's destruction of Gaza and now fighting more wars on behalf of Israel. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1857.96s)]
*  That was the bridge too far and so now Ben Shapiro is going to use whatever he can to get [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1864.1200000000001s)]
*  Tucker Carlson. Now he knows he doesn't have the popular support. He knows his position doesn't [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1868.8400000000001s)]
*  have the popular support, but there's one guy who does have a lot of popular support and that's [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1873.96s)]
*  Donald Trump. So now this never Trumper will try to weaponize Donald Trump against me and against [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1879.32s)]
*  Tucker Carlson in the most pathetic way. Listen, listen, I know a lot of people listen to the show [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1887.1599999999999s)]
*  supported Donald Trump, you know, I threw my support behind him in the last election too, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1894.2s)]
*  but like all of you know that that clip from Donald Trump is the most retarded thing he's [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1899.1599999999999s)]
*  ever said in his life. What a like it is actually I swear to God there was something about it that [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1907.4s)]
*  I've never looked at Donald Trump as being so old. It was like as soon as he said it I was like oh [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1915.24s)]
*  yeah he's 80. That's what's going on here. He said Tucker Carlson should get a TV network so that some [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1921.0s)]
*  people actually listen to him. Excuse me, Tucker Carlson is the biggest, most influential right-wing [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1931.64s)]
*  political commentator in the country. You did his show. He, you know, think about like what a piece [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1940.68s)]
*  of shit Donald Trump is. Tucker Carlson man, he gave the keynote speech at the Republican [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1949.0800000000002s)]
*  National Convention. He stuck his neck out for the president, he's gone to bat for the president, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1955.88s)]
*  he was touring campaigning with him all around the country, got up at Madison Square Garden and [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1961.0s)]
*  spoke on behalf of the president, spoke at a bunch of different events. He was the intellectual [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1966.12s)]
*  backing for Donald Trump because he could say it in a way that Donald Trump couldn't say it himself. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1971.24s)]
*  He was the number one rated show in cable news, got fired and got bigger by orders of magnitude. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1976.44s)]
*  Donald Trump, if you need, let me ask something. Hey Donald Trump, if you need a TV network [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1985.56s)]
*  for people to hear you then why did you do so many podcasts to get yourself back in the White House? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1991.48s)]
*  Did people not hear you on Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson or with Theo Vaughn or with Andrew [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=1999.16s)]
*  Schultz? You're hanging out with the NELC boys. What are you talking about dude? Did you really? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2004.76s)]
*  Here's the thing, Trump knows this and he was smart enough to listen to Barron, at least that's [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2010.68s)]
*  what some reporting is saying, is that Barron was the one who convinced him that you got to do the [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2016.36s)]
*  podcast. This is where the eyeballs are now, which would make sense that his son would be a little [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2019.8799999999999s)]
*  more, you know, have his finger on the pulse or whatever. But Trump obviously internalized that [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2024.92s)]
*  lesson because he did all the shows, they got huge, huge numbers and they brought him back into the [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2029.72s)]
*  White House. He just wants to knock Tucker. It's that simple. He just wants to insult him because [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2034.2s)]
*  that's how it is with Donald Trump. Loyalty is an entirely one-way street. It doesn't matter what [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2042.3600000000001s)]
*  you did for the guy. You could have given him 300 million dollars. You could have reinstated him on [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2048.12s)]
*  Twitter. You could have fought for him every single day. You could have given his keynote [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2053.48s)]
*  speech at the Republican National Convention. You could have done any of this. But if he perceives [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2058.12s)]
*  that you disagreed with him on something, by the way, Tucker didn't insult him. Tucker went out of [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2063.0s)]
*  his way to compliment Donald Trump, just said he disagrees with him getting us into this war. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2067.8s)]
*  Nope, you're done. And not just you're done, but you're a loser. Nobody listens to you. Tucker [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2071.8s)]
*  Carlson is breaking the internet right now for his grilling of Ted Cruz, but nobody listens to him. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2077.08s)]
*  But you know what's even lower? What's even lower than what Donald Trump does is what Ben Shapiro is [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2082.76s)]
*  doing right here because Ben Shapiro is doing it from a podcast. He doesn't even have a TV show. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2088.76s)]
*  He's insulting his own brand just because his big brother, he thinks now, who by the way, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2096.36s)]
*  he was never loyal to to begin with, but just because he thinks he can use him because it's [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2102.44s)]
*  the only way he knows he can win over the audience that people do seem to like that guy. They sure [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2106.28s)]
*  don't like you. But so now he's going to use Trump saying you have to have a TV network so anyone can [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2111.0s)]
*  listen to you. I mean, come on. It's just too pathetic. Man, of all the segments he's done [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2117.32s)]
*  about me the first time he says my name and it's the most pathetic segment yet. Unbelievable. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2126.52s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Sheath [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2132.44s)]
*  Underwear. Guys, I've been telling you about this company for so long. Great company run by great [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2136.52s)]
*  people and they make an unbelievable product. The most comfortable pair of boxer briefs you will [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2141.88s)]
*  ever wear. Sheath uses moisture wicking technology to create underwear that keeps everything [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2146.84s)]
*  breathable and incredibly comfortable for you downstairs. Now that the warm, hot summer months [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2152.1200000000003s)]
*  are upon us, it's really nice to have a nice breathable pair of Sheath Underwear. I'm telling [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2158.1200000000003s)]
*  you, if you're active and you're outside and you're sweating, put on a pair of Sheath Underwear. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2163.0s)]
*  You're going to be a much happier person than you are in whatever other boxer briefs you were [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2167.48s)]
*  wearing. Also, they are a longtime sponsor of this show, so make sure to go support these guys. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2171.48s)]
*  SheathUnderwear.com is the website and use the promo code problem for 20% off your order. They [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2176.44s)]

*  off your order. All right, let's get back into the show. All right, let's keep playing. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2189.7200000000003s)]
*  It's worthwhile noting who does agree with Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Green and Dave Smith [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2197.48s)]
*  and Candace Owens and all the other very loud voices who are claiming that President Trump [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2202.44s)]
*  has betrayed the movement and so on and so forth. Those people would include Representative [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2206.36s)]
*  Alexander Ocasio-Cortez, Representative Thomas Massey of Kentucky, who President Trump has [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2211.1600000000003s)]
*  won his primary. It includes Bernie Sanders, who has also come out against the President of [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2216.1200000000003s)]
*  the United States. The horseshoe theory is real and working. Thomas Massey says, quote, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2221.0s)]
*  this is not our war. I'm introducing a bipartisan War Powers Resolution tomorrow to prohibit our [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2226.2000000000003s)]
*  involvement. So first of all, that is not how the War Powers Resolution, I mean, you can provide the [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2231.0s)]
*  resolution. But then the President has 60 days within which to continue to conduct activities [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2235.0s)]
*  before he has to go back to Congress for the possibility of a permission or shutdown of funds. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2239.56s)]
*  So good luck with that because this thing is going to be over well before that. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2243.96s)]
*  Alexander Ocasio-Cortez signed on as well. Bernie Sanders, very up. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2247.08s)]
*  So here we have Ben Shapiro now after all of that in invoking what can only be described as the lowest [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2251.32s)]
*  IQ argument in politics. There simply is no lower IQ argument than this one. Now, by the way, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2262.12s)]
*  it's a somewhat effective one. And this is it because we are, you know, we are social animals [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2269.3199999999997s)]
*  and social psychology plays a big role. And so this is, this is how you get like the lowest IQ [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2275.4s)]
*  boomers on your side is you go, you, you, you like that policy, the left disagree with that policy. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2281.3199999999997s)]
*  You like the left. That's it. That's all the argument is. Now you feel this way. So does AOC. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2289.24s)]
*  You have cooties now. Okay. So I agree with people on the left on this issue. Who are you with Ben [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2297.72s)]
*  Shapiro? You're with the CIA and Benjamin Netanyahu and Lindsey Graham and Dick Cheney and George W. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2305.0s)]
*  Bush. I'm sure they all support this war as well. That's who you're with. What does that disprove [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2312.8399999999997s)]
*  like? What does it even mean? Like if I could make the argument that oxygen is necessary to sustain [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2318.44s)]
*  human life and someone could say, or agrees with that argument, like what? Okay. Who cares? It's [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2325.48s)]
*  either correct or it's incorrect. Which one is it? And this is the, and then for Ben Shapiro, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2333.16s)]
*  cause you know, he's, he's not just pretending to be a Trump supporter. He's also pretending to be [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2338.8399999999997s)]
*  an American patriot. He's also pretending to be a conservative, but you know, at one point he used [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2345.56s)]
*  to pretend to be a constitutionalist and he's now arguing against Congress taking back the power to [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2349.96s)]
*  declare war. That's what you've found yourself arguing now. I forget this last little line here [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2356.7599999999998s)]
*  about how, Oh, the war will be over in 60 days. Okay. Maybe, maybe not. Has anybody worried about [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2363.48s)]
*  that possibility? Yeah. You say the world will be over in 60 days. Yeah. You also said we'd be [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2371.88s)]
*  greeted as liberators and the war would be paid for an oil. It would be a cake walk and the weapons [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2376.52s)]
*  of mass destruction were a slam dunk, right? Yeah. It's easy to sit here and say when you launch a [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2381.48s)]
*  war, this is going to be a piece of cake, but who knows if that's right or not? Certainly no reason [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2386.92s)]
*  to suspect it is. I mean, I hope it is like we're at war already at this point, right? I'd much rather [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2393.1600000000003s)]
*  look bad and the situation be less of a catastrophe. I hope the war is over soon. I hope it is as, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2402.2000000000003s)]
*  I hope it's as, as little of a disaster as possible because I'm not rooting for that, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2412.28s)]
*  but to just sit here, it's like what all the Hawks are doing. I was just going off about this on the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2417.96s)]
*  Pierce Morgan show. It's like all these guys, like with such confidence a few days into a war. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2421.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, this is so easy. It's going so good. It'll be over by the time the war powers acts like, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2428.44s)]
*  okay. I'm just saying, I know the only comparisons we're allowed to use our world war two, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2433.7200000000003s)]
*  world war two last I checked did not wrap up in 60 days. But you know, I do, it's a weird thing of [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2440.12s)]
*  me. I do like to reference all of the other wars of the last 25 years. None of them were over that [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2447.48s)]
*  quickly. None of them, not even close. Many of them went on for multiple decades and Iran, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2454.44s)]
*  at least on paper is a much tougher adversary than any of them by any metric. You know, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2462.6s)]
*  Iran is, if you could, if you could picture like on a map, you have like Iraq and then there's Iran [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2469.48s)]
*  and then there's Afghanistan. You know, Iran is three times bigger than Iraq. They also have much [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2474.76s)]
*  more difficult terrain to fight on. They also have a military and an air force and [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2480.36s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic missiles. They actually have a fighting shot or ballistic missiles, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2484.84s)]
*  maybe not intercontinental, but they have ballistic missiles. And so also they've already [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2492.2000000000003s)]
*  touched Israel. This is already gotten Israeli civilians killed, which all of a sudden just [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2497.48s)]
*  doesn't seem to be that big of a priority. You know, like we, we were, I thought that was the [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2504.36s)]
*  thing that really mattered. But no, that doesn't even really matter either, I guess. All right, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2510.1200000000003s)]
*  let's keep playing. Set. The boys over at Pod Save America are siding with Tucker Carlson and [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2514.6s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene. I have a general rule. If the people at Pod Save America are agreeing with [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2524.52s)]
*  you on a major foreign policy issue, the designers of the JCPOA, you are doing it wrong. Here's Tommy [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2528.84s)]
*  Vieter, a former van driver. Let's pause it right there. Let's pause it right there. Again, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2535.0s)]
*  that's Ben Shapiro's rule of thumb. It's the dumbest rule imaginable. It's unbelievable. This guy's [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2540.92s)]
*  supposed to be like a professional smart person. This is the dumbest, lowest IQ argument imaginable. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2546.44s)]
*  If the guys from that podcast are with you, then it must be a bad idea. Ben, like, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2553.4s)]
*  do you defend the war in Iraq? Do you, do you defend that war? You know who was against that war? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2560.52s)]
*  People like Ron Paul, people like Pat Buchanan and a whole bunch of leftists, a whole bunch of leftists. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2566.36s)]
*  You know who was for it? You. You supported it. You supported that catastrophe. Now, like, imagine, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2573.0s)]
*  look, like, I know it's tough for me to relate to this position because, you know, I've been [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2580.76s)]
*  right about all the major issues of our time. It's just kind of true. I've just been on the [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2586.44s)]
*  right side of them. So, I mean, I don't think there's one major issue. I'm saying like a major [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2591.7200000000003s)]
*  U.S. policy that since I've been doing this podcast, anyone, including Ben Shapiro, could sit here and [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2597.88s)]
*  argue that I didn't get right. Like when Ben Shapiro was saying, take the vaccine, you dopes, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2604.84s)]
*  when Ben Shapiro was supporting lockdowns, what was I doing? Oh yeah, that's right. I was telling [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2611.08s)]
*  the truth and getting it right. But imagine, I'm trying to imagine, imagine you had cheerlead the [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2616.6800000000003s)]
*  war in Iraq or you had cheerlead any of these other wars, and then you're going to, you're going to [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2623.8s)]
*  turn around and advocate for the next war without even like the slightest bit of like, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2629.56s)]
*  look, I'm hoping this isn't a disaster again. And look, I'm hoping the war will be over in 60 days, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2636.12s)]
*  but I guess we really don't know what's going to happen and what the reaction is going to be here. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2640.84s)]
*  No, it's, it'll work. It'll be over in 60 days. You're an idiot. You agree with the left. Yeah, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2645.0s)]
*  the left were much better on the, at least during George W. Bush, the left was much better on the [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2650.92s)]
*  wars in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq. Then neocon hawks like Ben Shapiro were, okay, I'll take [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2658.68s)]
*  them. Like, what does this even mean? Again, again, like just to drive this point home, like do you, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2666.2799999999997s)]
*  Ben Shapiro, do you hate Adolf Hitler? You know, who's on your side? Joseph Stalin. Wow. See my [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2672.2799999999997s)]
*  rule of thumb is I don't agree with Joseph Stalin. Tell me, is that an intelligent argument or is [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2680.9199999999996s)]
*  that the dumbest shit you've ever heard in your life? You tell me. All right, let's keep going. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2686.76s)]
*  Are doing it wrong. Here's Tommy Vita, a former van driver for Barack Obama. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2694.44s)]
*  The folks they're fighting against are like Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, Marjorie Taylor [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2699.48s)]
*  Green, who I think on the merits, I mean, on the merits and on the politics, like I'm team Tucker, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2703.32s)]
*  Steve, Venti here, fellas. So on the merits, I think they have correctly identified when [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2710.36s)]
*  they did so before this week that this wasn't really just about weapons of mass destruction. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2716.52s)]
*  This was a regime change war, which has been confirmed by all these reports that Trump is [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2721.16s)]
*  vetoing plans to kill the Iranian supreme leader. So check for Tucker there. And then the politics, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2725.64s)]
*  I just think that like Tucker and Bannon and MTG are way more in tune with the MAGA base than like [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2731.24s)]
*  the gang at National Review. And no one wants another war in the Middle East. And no one is [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2736.84s)]
*  going to believe another intelligence based, trust me, we're the experts pitch about why we need to go [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2742.28s)]
*  decapitate the leaders of another Middle Eastern country. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2750.2000000000003s)]
*  So first of all, Israel has not asked the United States to decapitate the leadership of another [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2753.7200000000003s)]
*  country. Second of all, Tommy Vitor is the biggest idiot in foreign policy. That dude worked with [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2757.6400000000003s)]
*  Ben Rhodes on the JCPOA to set up an Iranian dominant Middle East that ended with October 7th [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2763.2400000000002s)]
*  and wild expansion of terror groups all over the region. That guy. So if he's agreeing with you, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2770.12s)]
*  you should be running for that. Also, if someone speaks for MAGA. Okay. So this is what's truly wild [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2775.88s)]
*  here. You're going to sit here and say that the JCPOA actually was what led to October 7th. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2783.7999999999997s)]
*  No argument. No reason why that is the case. I mean, the actually they're using the fact that [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2791.48s)]
*  Iran was enriching up to 60% as the reason why Israel's justified in launching this war. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2799.56s)]
*  But they're also, he's also blaming the deal that kept them enriching lower. It was after Trump tore [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2806.68s)]
*  up the deal that they upped their enrichment levels because they didn't have to abide by it anymore. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2814.2s)]
*  This is just too insane. Hey, if you want to look at a policy that handed Iran some more influence, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2819.32s)]
*  I've got a much bigger one for you. The war in Iraq. Like, so for those of you guys who don't know, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2828.92s)]
*  right? The Iraq is a majority Shiite country that's next door neighbors with Shiite Iran. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2836.52s)]
*  Okay, so they were, they have a super majority of Shiites in their population. So Dom Hussein's [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2845.6400000000003s)]
*  Ba'athist parties were Sunnis. So they were the minority was ruling over the majority. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2852.04s)]
*  Okay, now, for those of you guys who don't know that much about this region, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2859.16s)]
*  there's people who know a lot more than me, I do know this much. The Shiite Sunni split, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2863.32s)]
*  pretty big deal over there. And they don't really care for each other. Little bit of background. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2868.04s)]
*  So we overthrew the Iran's next door neighbors, Sunni dictator, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2873.7200000000003s)]
*  and instituted elections. And you'll never guess who won. The Shiites did. We essentially [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2881.64s)]
*  handed Baghdad to Iran on a silver platter. That's what gave them the increased influence [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2890.12s)]
*  in the region, not the deal with Obama, which by the way, they were abiding by before Donald [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2897.88s)]
*  Trump tore it up. And they were no longer. They were no longer forced to at that point. But all [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2904.44s)]
*  of this, like, again, if you notice, he can't even he doesn't even respond to any of the arguments [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2911.96s)]
*  that this guy I don't know this guy, I don't know, I don't never listen to pod save America in my [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2916.76s)]
*  life. I've heard of it before. But like, what he just said there was entirely reasonable, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2920.36s)]
*  entirely reasonable. And then, of course, Ben Shapiro makes the point. This is how they always [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2925.16s)]
*  play it, right? They always play it that Israel isn't even asking America. Israel's not even asking [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2929.72s)]
*  America to do nothing. It's like, first of all, Axios broke a story just a couple days ago. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2935.3999999999996s)]
*  Israel is actually asking America. Yeah, they're asking America to bomb Iran. Of course, they [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2941.48s)]
*  always are. And, you know, but even without that, we're not asking America for anything except [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2945.48s)]
*  $4 billion a year unconditionally and give us all of your weapons and your intelligence sharing so [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2952.76s)]
*  that we're capable of pulling this off. Okay, well, that is actually kind of asking for something. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2957.56s)]
*  Now is it we're not asking for anything. We just when the rockets come flying back at us, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2961.8s)]
*  we're going to need you to shoot them down because we can't defend ourselves. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2965.7200000000003s)]
*  Kind of seems like you are asking for something. And the point is that, as I said before, and I've [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2969.0s)]
*  been saying this last week, if you're saying that because an Iranian proxy conducted October 7th, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2974.44s)]
*  therefore Iran is at war with them, okay, well, this is an American proxy who started a war [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2981.96s)]
*  with Iran. And so from the Iranian perspective, if you're being consistent with this, from the [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2988.12s)]
*  Iranian perspective, they've been attacked by America. And just from any reasonable perspective. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=2994.44s)]
*  And so what happens now? What happens if in the response to this, some Americans are killed? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3001.08s)]
*  What does Donald Trump do then? Do you really think Donald Trump you think if a couple Americans get [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3008.28s)]
*  killed in a retaliatory Iranian strike, that Donald Trump's just going to take that and not [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3013.24s)]
*  have to drop the biggest bomb in the history of bombs or something like that. This thing can [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3018.92s)]
*  escalate very, very quickly. And for you to sit here and just point out that it's like, oh, these [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3024.44s)]
*  guys agree with you, therefore you're wrong. While we stare into the abyss of catastrophe, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3029.56s)]
*  it's just pathetic. All right, let's keep playing. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3036.2s)]
*  That guy. So if he's agreeing with you, you should be running for that. Also, if someone speaks for [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3042.44s)]
*  MAGA, Tucker can't speak for MAGA. Marjorie Taylor Greene doesn't speak for MAGA. Tommy [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3046.2s)]
*  Vieterschris doesn't speak for MAGA. I mean, that's just ridiculous. At least Tucker and [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3050.68s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene can claim to have voted for the president. Tommy Vieterschris hates that guy. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3055.4s)]
*  And he's going to speak for what MAGA wants. Good luck again. It's just it's like, again, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3059.16s)]
*  all Ben Shapiro has is intense dishonesty and the dumbest arguments. Did either of those guys claim [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3065.7999999999997s)]
*  to speak for MAGA? Like, what does that even mean? Do you see how he's just trying to play these like [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3074.12s)]
*  tribal games? It's purely just like you're on this team. That's that team. That's them over there. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3080.2799999999997s)]
*  You're going to let that team speak for your team? No, I say President Trump speaks for our team. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3087.32s)]
*  The guy, at least from the clip he just played, he never claimed to speak for MAGA. Like, I never [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3092.44s)]
*  claimed to speak for MAGA. I said Trump has betrayed his principles or his promises or whatever, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3097.4s)]
*  but what his base wanted. But I'm not claiming to speak for them. It's simply what the people [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3103.48s)]
*  wanted from Donald Trump and what they voted him into power for. And, you know, if you need to know [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3109.0800000000004s)]
*  that, you can just look at all the stuff Donald Trump talked about during the campaign about how [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3115.64s)]
*  he was going to end wars and keep us out of wars and how Joe Biden was just wanted to bomb everything [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3119.24s)]
*  and he wasn't going to do that. They didn't claim to speak for MAGA. What they said is that there's [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3123.96s)]
*  a big split within the MAGA world right now and we agree with this side more because we don't want [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3132.2799999999997s)]
*  to see another regime change war. That's what they said. And so, again, there's just like there's no [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3138.6s)]
*  actual argument here. This is so incredibly weak. All right, let's play it. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3144.12s)]
*  One person kind of speaks for what MAGA as a general rule wants. And I may disagree with it, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3151.4s)]
*  you may disagree with it, but only one guy speaks for that movement and that is the President of [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3156.04s)]
*  the United States. Which brings us to the subject of today's takedown. Okay, here, let's pause it [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3159.88s)]
*  right there. So Ben Shapiro now is essentially, again, only doing this because Donald Trump has [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3166.68s)]
*  cucked to Israel and so now, of course, he'll have Ben Shapiro's undying support. Ben Shapiro [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3176.04s)]
*  is repeating the Trump line that nobody else speaks for MAGA. Only Donald Trump speaks for MAGA. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3182.2s)]
*  So are you, is Ben Shapiro's argument here that there is nothing Donald Trump could do [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3191.2400000000002s)]
*  that would be a betrayal of America first or of MAGA? What does this even mean? If Donald Trump [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3198.6s)]
*  were to turn around tomorrow and just say, you know, I'm implementing Kamala Harris's entire policy, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3204.76s)]
*  is that MAGA now? Is this what you're saying, Ben Shapiro, that only Donald Trump gets to care? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3212.92s)]
*  By the way, again, if you notice here, there's no, what does this even mean? MAGA is make America [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3220.12s)]
*  great again. It was a slogan that Ronald Reagan came up with that I believe Roger Stone convinced [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3226.92s)]
*  Donald Trump to run on. By the way, it's a great political slogan. That's one thing Donald Trump's [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3235.08s)]
*  great at is being the best self-promoter ever. So he's, but again, you realize you're into a [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3240.52s)]
*  realm where we're not even actually talking about anything. Make America great again is whatever [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3245.32s)]
*  Donald Trump says is make America great again. And if you don't get to say what MAGA is or you [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3250.6800000000003s)]
*  don't get to say, yeah, but you know what? I get to say what I think is the correct policy. So like, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3256.2000000000003s)]
*  what are we even talking about here? When you strip away all the nonsense, what are you left with? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3261.4s)]
*  What does that even mean? Are you saying that no matter what Trump does, it's right? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3266.1200000000003s)]
*  Is that what Ben Shapiro says? No, what, imagine Donald Trump turning on Israel and then we'd see [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3270.68s)]
*  what Ben Shapiro had to say about Donald Trump, but you're not. So you're saying whatever he says [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3276.44s)]
*  is MAGA. Okay, fine. Fine. I'll concede that. Okay. When he says the wrong thing, I'm going to oppose [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3280.68s)]
*  it. When he says the right thing, I'm going to support it. When he enacts the wrong policy, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3287.48s)]
*  I'm going to oppose it. When he enacts the correct policy, I'm going to support it. What are we [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3291.2400000000002s)]
*  talking about here? What has he added to this conversation other than like he's just insulting [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3295.8s)]
*  me, criticizing my consistency when he's been far more inconsistent, playing a clip of Donald Trump [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3302.92s)]
*  insulting Tucker Carlson in the most idiotic way, playing a very reasonable clip from Pod Save America [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3310.1200000000003s)]
*  and then saying, see, these lefties agree. Are you on their team? And then concluding with MAGA is as [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3317.32s)]
*  MAGA does. What Donald Trump says it and that's MAGA now. Okay. Like I just don't know. Like, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3325.08s)]
*  listen, obviously Ben Shapiro is not an idiot. He's got a very high verbal IQ. It's not easy [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3333.08s)]
*  to motor mouth speed talk the way he does, but he's good at doing that. Obviously he's a talented [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3339.48s)]
*  guy and he's, but in terms of the actual substance of his arguments here, the, I don't think there's [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3346.36s)]
*  a dumber person in the world. Like there's no one you could find the most like picture in your mind, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3353.24s)]
*  the dumbest caricature of a guy who's just blindly supporting Donald Trump, missing teeth and overalls, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3359.4799999999996s)]
*  whatever you want to put on them. These are the type of arguments that guy would throw out. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3366.4399999999996s)]
*  What is this? This is just pure nonsense. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3371.08s)]

*  there. I think we kind of covered it. What can I say? I know I've been harsh on Ben Shapiro here. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3430.68s)]
*  I will congratulate you for working up the courage to speak my name. I know it took a long time, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3437.48s)]
*  took years, but we got here. I appreciate it. But you know, when you say my name, I reserve the right [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3443.88s)]
*  to eviscerate all of your arguments. But hey, if you think I'm wrong, Ben Shapiro, since we're on a [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3451.7200000000003s)]
*  first name basis now, Ben, if you feel like I'm wrong, then come get you some dude. Anytime, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3457.4s)]
*  any moderator, any format, any place, I'll fly to you. Let's do it. Let's sit down and really [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3464.6800000000003s)]
*  hash this out and let's see. Let's see who's got the stronger arguments. All right, look, man, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3471.7200000000003s)]
*  there's not, you know, we're in a new media world now. There's obviously, I think one of the, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3477.08s)]
*  one of the kind of common themes here is that the people who were in, in the old media order, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3485.96s)]
*  and I include Ben Shapiro in this, they're very resentful that a lot of younger and newer voices [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3495.56s)]
*  like myself are getting big platforms now and getting large audiences. And, you know, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3503.32s)]
*  the, I understand it. It's human nature to some degree. There's also this dynamic, you know, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3511.16s)]
*  of course, look, really since, really since Douglas Murray, since the debate with Douglas Murray, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3516.92s)]
*  I've just been getting attacked by these guys a lot more. You know, the Mark Levin's and Ben [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3522.84s)]
*  Shapiro's and Dave Rubin's and all these guys, you know, who kind of felt like they were in [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3529.08s)]
*  when things were more controlled and are losing influence, that they've been attacking me like [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3534.44s)]
*  crazy. And that's fine. I mean, listen, this is the business we sign up for. I'm not, that's fine. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3539.64s)]
*  You know, I've said for a long time, I'm very, very blessed to have the career I have. I truly [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3545.96s)]
*  love what I do. I genuinely love it. I love going to work every day and I have an amazing family. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3551.72s)]
*  And this work that I do is able to provide a very nice life for them. So I am enormously lucky and [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3559.72s)]
*  fortunate and blessed. The price tag that comes along with it is that some of these warhawks are [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3567.24s)]
*  going to like trash me. Like, Hey, that's a good deal. I actually kind of get a kick out of it. So [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3572.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm very happy with this. But what I think probably a lot of you have seen, and I've certainly seen, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3577.24s)]
*  is that a lot of these guys, they kind of don't know what to do with me. They don't really know [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3582.2799999999997s)]
*  how to, you know, it's like, shit, you know, all right, we, I guess we could debate. Well, we can't [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3587.72s)]
*  really debate him because he just wins all the debates. We can't really call him an anti-Semite [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3595.56s)]
*  because he's Jewish. So that kind of is a tougher sell. I mean, they try, but it's a tougher sell. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3599.7999999999997s)]
*  And so what they've, they've kind of settled on is this just like, you know, whatever the Douglas [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3604.84s)]
*  Murray stuff, you're not an expert. You don't know enough. You're just a comedian. You're just, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3610.7599999999998s)]
*  it's like, this is kind of the repeat of the repeating line that everyone said for a while. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3616.44s)]
*  And this was both Mark Levin and Ben Shapiro for a while. It seemed like the way they would deal [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3620.92s)]
*  with me is to not even recognize my presence. Like we won't even say his name. We'll do segments [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3624.76s)]
*  on him, but say the comic guy just to be dismissive. But the problem is that my, my, um, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3632.6000000000004s)]
*  my profile just keeps rising. It keeps getting bigger and bigger. And so now they're like, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3640.76s)]
*  huh, I guess, I guess we can say his name, but we got to go at him or whatever. They try to use [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3645.1600000000003s)]
*  these ridiculous low IQ tactics, but I'll just say this, man, if you've supported a bunch of wars [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3649.88s)]
*  and got them disastrously wrong, have the most basic amount of integrity, which is that if you're [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3657.4s)]
*  going to do all these public segments about it, then sit down and actually have the debate and [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3664.52s)]
*  see if your ideas can stand up. You know, then, then they turn around and say, this is their other [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3669.7200000000003s)]
*  type of, that's why they're losing. And so then they go, Oh, you're just a debate me, bro. You [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3674.6s)]
*  just want to debate everyone. And someone said that to me, uh, the other day as I was standing [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3679.0s)]
*  up to the war, someone, a fairly prominent account on Twitter said, you're just in this for attention [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3684.12s)]
*  for yourself. You're like, we all do shows. What? Like that's your line of argumentation. Well, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3690.04s)]
*  I'm in it for attention, but then Shapiro is not. We all turn cameras on and put them on ourselves. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3699.08s)]
*  So sure. But it's interesting that only the guy opposing the war is in it for his own profile. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3704.68s)]
*  The guy is supporting the war. Who's going on all these shows. What they don't, they don't care about [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3710.92s)]
*  being in the show. It's just, it's all so ridiculous. But I would just say from my perspective, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3715.72s)]
*  when I do these segments where I'm like taking someone on every single time I offered to, to [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3722.92s)]
*  debate them, cause that just to me feels like the integrity move. If I'm going to talk all this [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3729.56s)]
*  shit, well then I'd better be prepared to go put my ideas up against the, uh, you know, to the test [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3734.2799999999997s)]
*  of seeing whether somebody else can take them on. I did one debate earlier today. I'm about to go [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3740.52s)]
*  do another debate tonight. Hey, Ben Shapiro, now that you're saying my name, come get you some, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3745.32s)]
*  let's see what's up. All right. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show today. Uh, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3752.44s)]
*  Friday and Saturday night right here in New Jersey, dojo of comedy, comicdavesmith.com [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3757.64s)]
*  for those ticket links. Catch you next time. Peace. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHPLDcxyr0&t=3763.08s)]
