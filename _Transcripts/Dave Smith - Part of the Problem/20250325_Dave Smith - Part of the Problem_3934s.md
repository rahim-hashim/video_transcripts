*  That's right. So is this is our first time at laugh boss [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=60.78s)]
*  I'm trying to think if I've ever done because I've done shows with you in Boston, right? It was back at Nick's comedy stop [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=63.32s)]
*  That's right. And this is a more proper comedy club there. There you go [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=69.18s)]
*  We did it at Nick's at comedy stop and I believe it was me and Lewis co-headlining and you and Tim Dillon were the special [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=73.30000000000001s)]
*  guests [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=80.04s)]
*  Who talked about three people being in the same place and one person being drastically further than them. Holy moly [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=81.4s)]
*  All right guys Tim Dillon special guest this week. It's will be I can't back that up, but it will be a great show [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm just kidding. We're not in the same place. We're fucking killing it bro doing good [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=94.36000000000001s)]
*  And then we got a bunch of stuff coming up after that Nashville coming up pretty soon [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=98.72s)]
*  Comic Dave Smith comm for all me and Rob's gigs together throughout the year [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  And then of course you've got some stuff coming up as well [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=108.48s)]
*  Des Moines, which apparently is supposed to be pronounced differently, but I give up on getting names, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=111.64s)]
*  I always thought it was Des Moines. I don't give a shit anymore [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=116.04s)]
*  however [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=118.56s)]
*  the fuck it's supposed to be sounded out in the most logical way is now the name of your city and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=119.0s)]
*  Yeah, I will make that buy if I have to run for government in order to get that law passed that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=123.16s)]
*  It needs to be spelled the most logical way that it should be read and or or [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=128.24s)]
*  We just get real angry Jew about it and we call everything New York [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=134.08s)]
*  Or like it could just be like New York seven [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  New New York, we could go a lot of different ways of this [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=142.56s)]
*  But we can't learn how to pronounce all these goddamn names [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  although I do always enjoy coming to your towns and then also up in steamboat and I [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=147.64s)]
*  Think I have my entire porch door mapped out and so that will be announced shortly [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=153.28s)]
*  Ooh new spots same spots a lot of mix of both a lot of mixed both mix of both and then [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Hopefully we'll be able to tack on some porches as more people reach out and extend their yards to the to the cause [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  All right. Well, you heard it here first if you're when you're planning out the rest of the porch tour [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=168.84s)]
*  Maybe stay away from signal. Maybe not the best [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=173.84s)]
*  Or if you're gonna do it just add the right people. Yeah, I mean if anything what an endorsement that our own government [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=177.4s)]
*  relies on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  The software signal to keep its messaging safe and secured who would have known it is this is a wild [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=185.68s)]
*  Great option in all of technology. Well, you know, it's funny the story broke [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=192.04s)]
*  About it. I want to say a half hours less than an hour before we went live yesterday. So I saw this story but [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=197.68s)]
*  let's just say it's from a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=206.0s)]
*  not very trustworthy source and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=208.72s)]
*  So I was like well [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=212.28s)]
*  I gotta like actually dig into this before I just take this on air and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=213.4s)]
*  Give a thought on it because I want to like come on here and then give a whole take on it and then be like [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=217.28s)]
*  Oh, it turned out it wasn't true at all [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=221.2s)]
*  Now that it's kind of 24 hours old I mean [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=224.48s)]
*  Jesus Christ not only is this thing real but it is [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  Let's just say it there's a lot of questions [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  Raised by it. So for for anybody who doesn't know there is I hesitate to even use the word journalist [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=237.48s)]
*  But there is a there's a hack propagandist named Jeffrey Goldberg [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=245.32s)]
*  Could be from any ethnicity or background. No way to know for sure [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=251.44s)]
*  He was a bit he's the I believe he's the like the editor-in-chief now or senior editor [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=256.12s)]
*  He's one of the big shots at the Atlantic [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=262.36s)]
*  Which is a pretty garbage publication, but he was known for [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=265.44s)]
*  Being one of the like the Russia gate, you know [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=270.8s)]
*  Like, you know, if you go find all his Russia gate takes that it'd be embarrassing how bad [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=274.12s)]
*  You know like promising we've got the dirt. Donald Trump is clearly in a conspiracy with Vladimir Putin [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=280.16s)]
*  He is one of not that this is that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  Small of a list, but he's one of the journalists who Donald Trump really hates [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=290.12s)]
*  He's like called him out by name many times Trump does not like this guy. Okay, so evidently [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  Waltz the national security [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=303.92s)]
*  Advisor who is one of Trump's worst picks I I know this from both his public persona and inside information that I've gotten just [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=306.04s)]
*  One of the absolute worst picks that Trump made [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  evidently Waltz set up a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  signal private chat [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=318.32s)]
*  This was weeks ago [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=321.72s)]
*  right before the US started bombing Yemen again the most recent time and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  Apparently on this signal chat it seems that it was a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=331.92s)]
*  Several people it seems it was obviously Waltz [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  Hegseth the defense secretary [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=341.2s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard the national security advisor [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=343.44s)]
*  Marco Rubio the Secretary of State JD Vance the vice president and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=347.36s)]
*  Ratcliffe [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=352.16s)]
*  the CIA director [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=353.88s)]
*  And then a wit cough I think was on it as well anyway [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=356.12s)]
*  So there's a big and they add this guy and just some anti Trump [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=359.64s)]
*  Reporter so some [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=366.04s)]
*  So anyway, so this is the story there [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=368.68s)]
*  He has released the signal chats with but redacted [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=372.04s)]
*  Taking out some parts for national security, and then he just ran this big piece on it yesterday now. They've got [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  I'd say at this point as of right now [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=385.0s)]
*  The the evidence is overwhelming seems like an understatement [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  I'd say it's conclusively the case that these people were all on signal [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=392.2s)]
*  They were they were talking about the bombing before it happened then the bombing happened [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=396.56s)]
*  Then they were celebrating the bombing happening after that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  There was some discussion about you know [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  How people felt about it will kind of get into all of that but more importantly than any of that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=408.35999999999996s)]
*  At this point what we have today that we didn't have yesterday is that Hegseth has been asked about this [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=414.28s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi Gabbard and Ratcliffe both testified before Congress today and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=421.0s)]
*  They've all kind of admitted it in the sense that none of them are denying it [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  It ranges from I think Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard would be in the not denying it camp [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=430.84s)]
*  And then Ratcliffe was just in the like yeah, we did it and there's nothing wrong with us doing that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=436.28s)]
*  So anyway, this pretty clearly happened [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=440.56s)]
*  And [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=443.6s)]
*  There's a few different angles we could go with this so I you could any thoughts you have Rob [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=446.0s)]
*  Just about the story in general. Yeah. Well first I'll just say that it's odd that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  Our world leaders are discussing bombing Yemen like it's planning a barbecue amongst friends [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  Who is it and the the casualness and the way that it's in this group? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=460.36s)]
*  JD Vance hell of an employee. Hey, I don't agree with this. But if that's what you guys want to do, I'll back it [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  What's most surprising to me about the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=472.06s)]
*  The story is as to how this guy was added and no one realized amongst that group of people to go [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=474.98s)]
*  Hey, who's this other person in our group? I mean just think of you're talking Secretary of State. Yes [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=481.18s)]
*  It's a pretty exclusive club for someone to be like the CIA director [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=487.5s)]
*  I mean if that was the room of people that get together minus the president I guess to make really big decisions [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=491.86s)]
*  It's remarkable to not go hey, who's the other name here? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=497.18s)]
*  Well, that's and there's just the other part that's just really shady about this story is usually [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=500.38s)]
*  When there's trouble in an administration, it's a very long time before anything gets investigated [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=505.86s)]
*  Think about the lapse of time between the Hillary Clinton email scandal and when she was actually brought in front of Congress or think about [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=512.22s)]
*  How little we've seen a Fauci as we unwind this kovat story? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=519.18s)]
*  I was unable to watch the hearing because it was while I was driving here [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=523.1s)]
*  But the fact that they had a hearing today to address what happened yesterday [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=526.66s)]
*  When is the last time you saw that happen in government? And that is a good point [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=530.8199999999999s)]
*  I I think that there's also just look it's just to start the thing because there's no kind of getting around it it is [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=534.5799999999999s)]
*  Remarkable the level of incompetence to allow this to happen or [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=545.02s)]
*  Perhaps this was intentional [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=549.78s)]
*  But those are kind of the only two options right here now [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=552.72s)]
*  There's I still can't believe that government relies on private technology for secret communications [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=556.32s)]
*  Well, there's I do not think this is how it's supposed to go [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=562.52s)]
*  Well, I understand that they're supposed to be I guess the presidential records act and I also understand that if you're working a government job [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=565.32s)]
*  I mean I've worked at sales jobs and I don't want a record of every conversation [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=572.68s)]
*  I'm having about every sale and so you use your own email [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=576.66s)]
*  I mean I it's so like I understand if you're why Hillary Clinton was using a private email server [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=580.12s)]
*  Yeah, I get that. She's not allowed to do that. I also get why she's doing that. Sure and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=584.64s)]
*  Anyways, if I'm working there, I don't understand how first day you're not calling up CIA and going hey [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=590.0s)]
*  Where's my Blackberry for communicating with my team? It's shocking that it's a public app [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=595.24s)]
*  That's the best technological option for these people to have a private conversation. Well, look when if you have [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=601.24s)]
*  Hillary Clinton using a private [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=608.32s)]
*  a private email where she's talking about say like whatever she's yoga [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=612.04s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, she's talking about some private and then some very, you know, like kind of shady public [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=618.0s)]
*  That's one thing. This is not there's nothing that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=624.32s)]
*  They're planning out a military strike, which is going to be made public [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=627.72s)]
*  It's not like there was some secret scandal that happened here and you could see in there like oh [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=631.72s)]
*  This is why they wanted it on signal. It is wild to think that the again [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=635.96s)]
*  You can't overstate it here the absolute highest levels of our government the highest levels of the foreign policy regime are [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=642.88s)]
*  communicating about a [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  Upcoming bombing campaign on [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=655.84s)]
*  Signal that is just bizarre like they're all in Washington DC [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=658.76s)]
*  Nice I guess the vice president wasn't he mentioned that in the chat [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=663.64s)]
*  But aside from that the rest of them are all in DC like isn't there I don't know [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=667.32s)]
*  I always thought there was a like a [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=672.44s)]
*  Situation room type fit. I don't know something like this is just very bizarre [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=675.64s)]
*  And again your point which just cannot be overstated and it really implicates all of them [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=680.32s)]
*  In terms of incompetence not in terms of like necessarily being malicious [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=685.8000000000001s)]
*  I think waltz is the is the one who's there's a question mark about [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=689.5s)]
*  But yeah that nobody noticed [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=694.26s)]
*  Hey [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=697.26s)]
*  Who's this other fella in here? I literally had friend firstly. I do I don't do any group messages. I just mute it [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=698.54s)]
*  I can't stand it. It drives me nuts [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=704.78s)]
*  It's too many notifications and then I start getting too concerned about what I'm saying in a group format [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=706.5799999999999s)]
*  ten years ago when I [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=712.66s)]
*  Pertook in group messages or group whatsapps. I always check the group to make sure hey wait who's in this group? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=714.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, even Rob would have been like hey, who's this JG right here? Who's that guy even before just saying some offensive? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=720.92s)]
*  Stupid remark I would check that it seems very remarkable to me that they're having their [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=727.4599999999999s)]
*  exclusive group of what ten names that are supposed to make these giant decisions in a secretive way and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=733.26s)]
*  They're not just checking wait. Who's this other name? It's unbelievable by the way twice [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=739.22s)]
*  In the group chat that got me he wrote a Joseph gerbils [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=744.1s)]
*  It is [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=751.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable, but they wouldn't have seen that either the the Trump administration is being undermined by the walls guy [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=752.46s)]
*  I hadn't even I'm not I wasn't too familiar with him or his name [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=760.0600000000001s)]
*  Or this is classic Donald Trump administration where there's some good and then there's some reckless slop [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=764.62s)]
*  Yep, no well it look I'm not sure which one it is. I will just say [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=771.54s)]
*  Okay, this is I might really be speaking out of turn here speculating. I just know that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=777.78s)]
*  you know [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=783.46s)]
*  I've like I've sent the wrong text message [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=785.54s)]
*  Before you know what I mean like text the wrong person like texted my buddy like I love you, baby [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=789.14s)]
*  Be home soon or whatever, but it's always because that was the last guy [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=793.38s)]
*  I was texting and my wife was the other last person out like these were the last two people [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=797.92s)]
*  I was texting and I hit the wrong one or something like that. It seems very weird that walls would add a [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=802.7199999999999s)]
*  Trump hating [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=810.76s)]
*  Atlantic [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=812.76s)]
*  Journal like what how did that mistake get made? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=813.88s)]
*  What now he's claiming by the way that he's never he has no relationship with [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=817.42s)]
*  With Goldberg that they he's like, I don't know this guy I've never talked to him. I've never anything [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=823.56s)]
*  It's like that seems weird to me [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=827.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't use signal but like wouldn't you have to have his name saved in your thing to add him or maybe not [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=829.8s)]
*  maybe I'm wrong about that it seems like a [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=835.28s)]
*  strange mistake to make [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=839.0s)]
*  I'll just say that seems like a really strange [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=841.4399999999999s)]
*  Mistake to make and I also just can't believe the way that foreign policy is being implemented [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=844.8s)]
*  Based off of the scattered screenshots that were apparently I guess he put enough screenshots over to go look [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=850.92s)]
*  I was in this conversation and I couldn't believe I was and that the details turned out to be true [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=857.22s)]
*  And then he took out all the military details. That's the way. Yes, I understand it the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=861.96s)]
*  Conversation flow of JD Vance pointing out. Hey our entire messaging right now is we need to do things [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=866.6s)]
*  They're in the strategic interest the United States. Why are we doing this when it benefits them? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=872.04s)]
*  No conversation at all about civilian casualties. Oh, that's yeah [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=876.5s)]
*  Well, let's let's get into that in a second because I do think that's really worth diving into [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=880.2199999999999s)]
*  I will say the only thing [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=884.78s)]
*  Did you read his piece in the Atlantic that he was a pay walled and I couldn't maybe I was sophisticated on getting around [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=888.5s)]
*  I don't think I didn't think of mine was pay wall [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=895.54s)]
*  They may had it behind the paywall and taking it off [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=897.56s)]
*  But I didn't or maybe they had it off and then put it behind [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=899.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure but I read it and did not subscribe [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=902.26s)]
*  I do not subscribe to the Atlantic and I didn't go through like the archives or anything [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=904.26s)]
*  But we got the one thing that stuck out to me that was like a head scratcher [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=908.18s)]
*  That was like something here doesn't add up is that he he says he removed himself from the conversation [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=912.7s)]
*  And he was like, oh, this is gonna let him know that I'm leaving but I've got what I need [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=919.66s)]
*  I'm out of here who the hell removes that what? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=924.54s)]
*  Journalist would remove themselves from that conversation like you just accidentally [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=927.86s)]
*  found yourself in a conversation between the National Security Advisor the director of national intelligence the defense secretary the vice president and the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=932.9s)]
*  Secretary of state and you're just sitting there and the CIA director and all that and you're just sitting there like what they just [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=940.5s)]
*  accidentally left the press in and then [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=945.98s)]
*  Clearly you've gotten deep enough into the thing where you're like nobody's checking who's in this group and then you just left [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=948.98s)]
*  That seemed very strange, you know why it was because a Radcliffe at the CIA said hey guys [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=955.14s)]
*  I just got my orders from the Jews that you know run things [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=959.94s)]
*  Yeah, I guess alright, you know what fine let's just [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=969.94s)]
*  Let's get into that right now because you kind of touched on it and it is in many ways to me the the most interesting [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=973.02s)]
*  part of all of this [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=978.66s)]
*  And of course, I do want to be clear [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=980.54s)]
*  This guy is [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=983.78s)]
*  Literally is a professional liar whose job it is is to damage Donald Trump [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=985.9399999999999s)]
*  And who might also like to damage other people too. So it is not I don't want to [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=992.6199999999999s)]
*  Assume there. It's quite possible that he took out other stuff too [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=999.3399999999999s)]
*  Like maybe there would have been some message that made Tulsi Gabbard look really good [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1002.5799999999999s)]
*  Like she had some principled opposition to this or something and he didn't put that in [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1006.06s)]
*  Doesn't seem like it though and it seems like because really if you remove yourself [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1009.9399999999999s)]
*  If you if you zoom out [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1015.18s)]
*  The real scandal here [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1017.62s)]
*  Which is so much bigger than this signal scandal or so much bigger than any of the other time the real scandal here is that [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1019.86s)]
*  You have after like [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1029.46s)]
*  20 plus years of what have been dubbed forever wars [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1032.62s)]
*  The longest wars in American history the longer wars than in our [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1037.82s)]
*  Most countries ever fight and they're let you know like most countries don't ever fight a 20 year long war [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1042.62s)]
*  we fought essentially two of them three if you count Somalia or there's the JSOC war the whole time there and [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1047.34s)]
*  Also regime changes and and Yemen and Libya and ultimately in Syria [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1054.58s)]
*  So after all this debt all these wars Donald Trump runs on this America first [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1060.26s)]
*  We're not gonna be involved in stupid wars anymore down to specifically Yemen, and I'm not even talking about him [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1067.5s)]
*  Objecting to say like Obama's drone bomb campaign in Yemen in 2009 or him [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1077.82s)]
*  Objecting to the Saudis invasion and and Obama backing the Saudis invasion in 2015 [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1083.58s)]
*  I'm saying on during the 2024 election was on Tim Pool show [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1089.18s)]
*  Donald Trump was straight-up asked about the issue of war and peace and he brought up Joe Biden bombing Yemen [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1094.54s)]
*  over the the shipping lanes and talking about how stupid it is and how so like [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1102.02s)]
*  Donald Trump comes in now at his most popular wins every swing state [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1108.5s)]
*  Has all of this energy behind him and yet we're still within a month and a half [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1114.3s)]
*  Bombing another country in the Middle East and like that is the bigger scandal out of all of this [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1120.8999999999999s)]
*  It's like the old the Tom Woods had this old saying and man does it age well [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1126.2199999999998s)]
*  No matter who you vote for you get John McCain [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1131.1599999999999s)]
*  Like that's just always what ends up happy you vote for Barack Obama. Sorry. All we can do is John McCain [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1134.4599999999998s)]
*  Oh, you like Donald Trump. Sorry, you're getting John McCain [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1139.52s)]
*  No matter who wins we get John McCain's foreign policy [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1143.28s)]
*  And so that's kind of the backdrop of this and then of course [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1146.24s)]
*  What is the most interesting thing politically in this is that at least from what's being reported? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1149.6399999999999s)]
*  Only one person in the room seems to even have a principled objection to this at all and it is JD Vance now [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1155.68s)]
*  I got to say [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1163.6399999999999s)]
*  That in itself is some is an important piece of information that we should keep in our minds like going forward [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1166.72s)]
*  If you were thinking about who you might support in [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1172.88s)]
*  2028 let's say I mean JD now to your point too and [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1175.4s)]
*  I you know [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1180.64s)]
*  Like I'll give him a little bit of credit for being the only one who stood up [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1182.0s)]
*  But I gotta say it was like pathetically weak [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1186.0800000000002s)]
*  Pathetically weak totally with the contingency of like I'll go along [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1189.96s)]
*  I mean like if you guys want to bomb them, I'll bomb them but and the only objection he has is [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1193.42s)]
*  over the like [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1199.1200000000001s)]
*  The it's always the worst [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1200.68s)]
*  Trumpian objection is that Europe should pay for the bombing a little bit more [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1203.52s)]
*  That's essentially what his objection is. I'll read it in a sec. I I was just [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1208.8s)]
*  somewhat shocked that [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1213.76s)]
*  It's not much of a strategy conversation [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1216.0800000000002s)]
*  It's more of an optics conversation and I would just think that you know for the pitch of maybe we don't always see the [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1218.6200000000001s)]
*  geopolitics behind what these conversations actually are [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1226.76s)]
*  No one's coming in and going well [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1230.08s)]
*  We've planned this out in strategic strike and we know that we can have blank result or hey [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1231.84s)]
*  This is a clear directive from the president. It's a very loose conversation of it's almost like the way I would go [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  Hey, I don't know if we need any TVs in the studio, but I saw a good deal over here. Oh, yeah, maybe maybe that's a good idea [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1243.48s)]
*  It's a very casual conversation [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1250.36s)]
*  There's not a lot of hey [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  I just got the military intelligence on this and we know that the bad guys are hiding out here [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1254.52s)]
*  And we can have a real impact but we got to act quickly. There's no like significant intelligence here [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1258.92s)]
*  It's mostly a conversation about hey, should we go? I think we're gonna go and do this and I think the optics [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1264.28s)]
*  Match the president's agenda at the moment. Okay, I'm alright with that. Yeah, I'm good [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1270.68s)]
*  No, it's a they're alluding to Trump seems to be the loosest of directives [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1274.3000000000002s)]
*  Like they're like at Donald Trump. He kind of he gave the green light [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1279.6000000000001s)]
*  You go [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1283.3200000000002s)]
*  He said open back up the shipping lanes and then it's kind of left up to us to figure out how so like in [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1283.64s)]
*  Your example you're almost like we were like, oh, you know [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1288.84s)]
*  I saw this monitor that looks cool and this one's on sale and then you'd be like well the owner of the studio said make [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1291.56s)]
*  It look cool [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1296.08s)]
*  You know like there's not even like a specific thing like you were tasked with getting this monitor and I found it at a good [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1296.84s)]
*  Price and therefore it was just a general like yeah [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1302.4399999999998s)]
*  What everything looks good kind of thing and so anyway, so this is the the only real aside from from this [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1304.9199999999998s)]
*  It all seems to just be them [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1311.0s)]
*  Agreeing by the way [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1314.6s)]
*  You know again there might be something here that wasn't reported no principled objection from Tulsi Gabbard whatsoever look [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1317.6s)]
*  I'm just saying I think I I think we were saying this the whole time, right? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1326.4399999999998s)]
*  like the whole time throughout Trump before the election after the election during his [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1331.9199999999998s)]
*  Selecting his cabinet that you were just like look [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1338.04s)]
*  He put a lot of bad people in there and the foreign policy team isn't good [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1340.3s)]
*  And even Tulsi Gabbard is not good when it comes to the this type of like tar targeted strikes [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1343.24s)]
*  Anyway, okay, so I'm gonna read from the article [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1350.04s)]
*  At this point a fascinating policy discussion commenced the account labeled JD Vance [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1353.48s)]
*  Responded at 816 team. I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1360.32s)]
*  But I think we are making a mistake [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1367.24s)]
*  He also was in Michigan so this is part of the reason that part of what was confirming that [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1370.2s)]
*  He writes three percent of US trade runs through the Suez [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1374.92s)]
*  Forty percent of European trade does there is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1379.76s)]
*  The strongest reason to do this is as Pota said to send a message [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1387.48s)]
*  now [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1393.64s)]
*  Look I give Vance some credit for at least being against this thing kind of I mean he does say I think we're making a mistake [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1399.76s)]
*  But [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1408.28s)]
*  this idea that like well, it's a [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1409.96s)]
*  It's a bigger percentage of Europe's trade. Therefore. It's kind of like we're bailing out their trade. I mean, this is the [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1413.6s)]
*  Like if there were a list of 15 reasons why you shouldn't do this this is 15th [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1422.2s)]
*  This is the last reason, you know, like I'm not even saying it's not a reason at all [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1427.76s)]
*  But it's not one of the major ones [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1432.0s)]
*  It's not as if he's sitting there and saying something like which I can you could call me like a hippie or something like that [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1434.1200000000001s)]
*  all you want to but like is it really that unreasonable that when [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1439.48s)]
*  My political leaders are murdering people they might consider whether the murder is absolutely necessary [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1443.8400000000001s)]
*  Or not like, you know, we're dropping huge bombs on people here. There's gonna be civilians who get killed [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1451.48s)]
*  Do we really need to do this? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1458.04s)]
*  I just don't think it's that crazy that that could maybe even enter the conversation [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1459.92s)]
*  Of course, it is that crazy and it doesn't enter the conversation at all [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1463.92s)]
*  Then you would think after that the concern would be that like we could be getting dragged into a wider war, you know [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1467.72s)]
*  If the whole argument is that Iran is arming them well, okay [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1475.48s)]
*  Do we really want to move closer toward a conflict with Iran? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1479.64s)]
*  Do we want to move closer toward a conflict in Yemen? Do we like why are we doing this? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1482.2800000000002s)]
*  It's not in our national security interests. We're doing this on behalf of a foreign country. None of that comes up at all [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1487.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just this, you know vague. I think it's a mistake [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1493.2800000000002s)]
*  Vance goes on to say I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1497.0s)]
*  There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1504.0s)]
*  I'm willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1509.52s)]
*  But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month doing the messaging work on why this matters [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1513.52s)]
*  Seeing where the economy is, etc [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1519.52s)]
*  Then Joe Kent I forgot Joe Kent was on this Joe Kent then comes in and says there is nothing time sensitive during the timeline [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1521.52s)]
*  We'll have the exact same options in a month [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1528.52s)]
*  Okay, they Pete Hegseth comes in and says VP I understand your concerns and fully understand your concerns [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1535.52s)]
*  And I'm going to be very clear on that [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1542.52s)]
*  Okay, they Pete Hegseth comes in and says VP I understand your concerns and fully support you raising with [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1544.52s)]
*  With POTUS important considerations most of which are tough to know how they play out economy Ukraine peace Gaza, etc [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1552.52s)]
*  I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what nobody knows who the Houthis are [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1561.52s)]
*  Which is why we would need to stay focused on one Biden failed and two around funded [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1568.52s)]
*  Isn't that just disgusting? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1575.52s)]
*  Like you know you're sitting here it's only by the way I just cannot stress for like I think for people Americans like us [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1579.52s)]
*  How how unique this is about our country and I know that there's sometimes like when things happen in your country [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1591.52s)]
*  You just kind of think of them as normal [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1599.52s)]
*  I'm saying like throughout the world and throughout human history how abnormal it is to be bombing a group of people who you have no idea who they are [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1601.52s)]
*  Like for most of human history if there was a war on the people of that nation would know who they were fighting a war against and understand why they were fighting a war against them [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1614.52s)]
*  We're such a rich country and such a powerful empire that were just bombing little third world shitholes and you're like yeah the problem here is the American people don't even know and you know what you're they're absolutely right [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1624.52s)]
*  Right. How many Americans what percentage of Americans do you think could find Yemen on a map let alone know the name of the group of people who are in charge [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1637.52s)]
*  You know like I don't know like I'll even give them a hint I'll be like here's a map find Yemen oh it's right at the bottom of the Arabian and the Arabian Peninsula go [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1651.52s)]
*  How many Americans you think could turn and find that on a map and so it's like look for him to be saying this it's like yeah in other words stated differently there is absolutely zero political desire from your base for you to go bomb Yemen [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1663.52s)]
*  There's no it's not even kind of like it's almost it's said in plain English right there because I mean he's not saying it but it's all it's in the information he's giving out right is that there is this is a totally top down move not bottom up there is nobody [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1681.52s)]
*  There is nobody this isn't mass deportations or you know eliminating waste in government or turning around the economy or bringing prices down this isn't like oh there's this desire from the people and they elected you to do this you're saying how do we trick them into thinking this and here's the answer [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1696.52s)]
*  One and two by the way this is something that should be a useful tool for people this is one of the positive things to come out of this signal chat and it's one of the things that I kind of challenge people like I'm talking to you listeners of our show right now when you see the mega influencers out there right when you're thinking about who to listen to [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1717.52s)]
*  Oh this guy makes good point but then I also think this guy makes a good point but I like this lady's point there is that I acted like women make points fine I'm just saying for the sake of argument think about how many of them were just saying number one and number two right after this strike in Yemen and I'm not like alleging that they're colluding with Pete Hegseth I'm just saying they're repeating the same dumb fucking mindless propaganda keep in mind here Pete Hegseth is not saying this is a very clear sentence Pete Hegseth is not saying the reason [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1738.52s)]
*  we need to do this is because number one Biden failed and number two they're backed by Iran he's saying that's what you tell the fucking people it's the only thing I could think of to tell people that they'll maybe resonate with them is there is there a real desire amongst the MAGA base for us to start bombing the shit out of the poorest country in the Middle East no but they do think Joe Biden's awfully weak and they're pretty suspicious of [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1768.52s)]
*  Iran because we've been propagandizing them with a bunch of bullshit about them for for years so that's how he's saying you could sell this to people it's a very revealing comment and anyway so that's that's what you were getting from Pete Hegseth okay all right Hegseth message went on to state waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus to immediate risks [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1798.52s)]
*  on waiting number one two immediate risks on on waiting one this leaks and we look indecisive to Israel takes a shit oh man did I not know I may not a screen grab the right part there okay to Israel sorry you can accuse me of covering up for the Israelis now I'm not sure what that was I lost it [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1828.52s)]
*  it's a the Atlantic piece I'm not sure what the title is I just screen grabbed this part hold on one second okay there's um I'll go on but if you find it that's that's fine all right hold on sorry Israel takes in associated and levy them on the Europeans now I don't think that's the right part [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1855.48s)]
*  JD Vance goes on to say to Pete Hegseth if you agree we should do it let's go I just hate bailing Europe out again so again JD Vance who is I suppose the hero in the room here judging on a curve if you turn that heat down a little bit rum [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1883.4s)]
*  he literally goes hey you guys want to do it fine let's do it I just hate bailing out Europe so there is simply in JD Vance no concern about killing innocent people no concern about us getting drawn into a wider war no concern about um dropping bombs on people on behalf of other [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1903.3600000000001s)]
*  countries this is clearly a result of Israel's beef not ours but he sure doesn't like those uh those Europeans being welfare moms doesn't seem to have any issue with Israel being a fat welfare mom but he really doesn't like the Europeans being on the doll so that's what you uh that's what we got here so far [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1926.32s)]
*  Hegseth responded to that said VP I fully share your loathing of Europeans free loading it's pathetic capital letters but Mike is correct we are the only ones on the planet on our side of the ledger who can do this nobody else even close question is timing I feel like now is as good a time as any given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes that's what I was referring to before I think we should go but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=1949.32s)]

*  I suppose a mixed bag is preferable to a bag of nothing but shit but there is just this level of like incompetence that not just to be doing this whole signal chat and you know forget it I'm totally open to the possibility that the National Security Advisor like was setting them up but no one else to notice and that is a pretty high level of incompetence [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2070.28s)]
*  Nobody else goes like you know from what I've understood because some people have been talking about this it's like you know signal might be used between these types of people to like coordinate a meeting or something like that ah we're all meeting here at this place or whatever but there seems to be no feeling from any of them that like hey we're talking about like a planned targeted strike and we're doing this over signal that seems pretty weird [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2094.2400000000002s)]
*  There is no one of the things I found particularly disgusting again people can call me a hippie for this shit if you want to but after the bombings done everybody's just sharing emojis which is like first on one level you're like what is the fucking might be only one might be only grown man who doesn't text emojis [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2122.2s)]
*  But wouldn't everyone become a teenage chick including the Secretary of Defense evidently but it's all just like I mean again call me crazy I think when you drop bombs on human beings even if there were like even let's just say in a scenario where you had to take out some bad guys and it came with killing some innocent people but it had to be done [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2141.16s)]
*  That's the starting point that I'm wrong and that it has to be done and these innocent people have to be killed you still think there would be a little bit of a somber tone you know it's like I don't know you know it's so funny because like I'm not you know like I believe in God but I'm not like a particularly religious person but all of these people [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2162.12s)]
*  Tulsi's got her own thing going on but like Pete Hegseth and all these guys they lead with how Christian they are that's like a big part of what they present themselves as and run on and it's like but yeah but don't any of you really believe in God because like wouldn't you wouldn't you think like if you just killed some people there'd at least be a part of you that was like man I sure do hope that God understands why I had to do you know you think you would have to at least show a little bit of like that part sure does suck [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2181.12s)]
*  That's a tragedy sorry about that no it's it's muscle emojis and American flag emojis [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2212.08s)]
*  Oh it was muscle it was a lot of a lot of from what I understand the bicep and the American flag and then you know something like about a hot boy not calling you back I don't know it's all ridiculous to me [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2219.08s)]
*  But this is someone in the chat just said this is my Vivek moment where I'm going after emojis [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2233.04s)]
*  This is where I don't care they're all gay you're all very very gay for doing this stop it [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2242.04s)]
*  All right fine you could put put the emojis in the chat is that but you know what I'm saying anyway there's just just none of that none of it whatsoever but look I'm sorry it's just it's hard to not look what Elon Musk is doing over at Doge I think is awesome [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2247.04s)]
*  It's inserted these ideas back into the national conversation but I gotta say we're looking at this already and it's very hard for me to not point out that it does seem that like in terms of the actual mechanisms of government [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2261.0s)]
*  There's just so much failure around already and it's just like even Doge right like everyone in the news could talk about how they're making these severe cuts but they're not [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2278.96s)]
*  There aren't drastic spending cuts you know what I'm saying like we just passed a CR that's that's increasing the deficit like there's we're not having drastic spending cuts and [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2290.96s)]
*  You know you were not having mass deportations look at the numbers there's no mass deportations going on but we are sending a few hundred to this horrible prison in El Salvador like what is what when you finally actually have the the the support of the people for mass deportations and you're elected on that [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2301.92s)]
*  So your move is to just send a few of them to the like worst fucking prison what are you trying to poison the well against me at mass deportations and then of course here on foreign policy I mean this stuff is just we're already bombing a poor country in the Middle East [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2324.88s)]
*  It's like the worst thing about Donald Trump is not any of the things that the Democrats tell you about Donald Trump you know the worst thing about Donald Trump is that he's pretty much the same as Obama and Biden like that's the actual actually the worst thing about him is that he's not that much different than all the other presidents we've had when it actually I'm sorry when it actually comes out in the first place and I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2338.88s)]
*  I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2368.88s)]
*  so incredibly sloppy this early into the administration you never want to have a [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2398.88s)]
*  moment where even Hillary Clinton can go and you know what I mean Hillary Clinton [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2404.1400000000003s)]
*  what legs does she have to stand on on any topic whatsoever but even on this [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2408.84s)]
*  one she tweeted something like did she yeah you might be able to find it was [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2413.48s)]
*  just something like this is crazy and or maybe was just actually talking about [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2417.6s)]
*  emojis it might have just been like the look at this emoji and even on that you'd [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2421.56s)]
*  be like that you got a point Hillary how often how often does something so sloppy [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2425.4s)]
*  happen that even Hillary Clinton can open up her dumb mouth and you can go [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2429.48s)]
*  well you got a point on that one yeah that's that's that's when you know [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2433.52s)]
*  you're really screwing up when anybody when when Hillary Clinton is ever [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2437.56s)]
*  granted a point on anything you know it's a you know it's not going good [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2441.92s)]
*  oh here's the Trump and what can I say Hillary's got a point and of all the [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2447.6s)]
*  reporters to send this to Jeffrey Goldberg oh my god oh it's just horrible [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2458.16s)]

*  I'm retweeting some of the stuff he said too for our own kind of very [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2481.8s)]
*  opportunistic isn't the exact right word but like okay we don't like the National [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2486.52s)]

*  discredited so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2581.8799999999997s)]

*  on the Houthi campaign because of the skill and courage of our troops I've [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2604.2799999999997s)]
*  monitored it very closely from the beginning and you see we've been [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2608.84s)]
*  managing four years of deferred maintenance under the Trump [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2613.1600000000003s)]
*  administration our troops our sailors were getting shot at as targets our [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2616.36s)]
*  ships couldn't sail through and when they did shoot back it was purely [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2620.84s)]
*  defensively or at shacks in Yemen President Trump said no more we will [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2624.56s)]
*  reestablish deterrence what you're saying is Biden was weak [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2630.52s)]
*  which is exactly what we're doing as we speak from the beginning [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2635.32s)]
*  overwhelmingly I mean look what can I say that all of that's just pathetic [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2641.1600000000003s)]
*  it's just pathetic it's a I understand open the situation he's in it's [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2648.96s)]
*  probably the best answer you could give but you could sit here and say yes we [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2653.44s)]
*  all agree Pete Hagseth yes Goldberg is trash he's a terrible [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2658.44s)]
*  journalist but the fact that he was pushing the Russiagate hoax or the fact [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2663.52s)]
*  that he was pushing the very fine people on both sides hoax you're not calling [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2669.32s)]
*  this a hoax and also he didn't put you can't really demonize him on this [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2673.04s)]
*  because at least according to the story he didn't push it he didn't go searching [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2677.96s)]
*  for it he didn't decide to run this story he got added by your national [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2682.44s)]
*  security advisor to a group chat with the most powerful people in the world [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2687.56s)]
*  leaking war plans and he was like well I mean I'm gonna run this in my [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2692.2s)]
*  publication there's just nothing here unless something else comes out that we [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2696.48s)]
*  don't have right here there's really nothing you can blame him for and so [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2700.0s)]
*  then to turn it around and then to try to to try to pivot toward Joe Biden was [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2702.7999999999997s)]
*  weak and that's where we were struggling like hey I recognize this this is number [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2709.4199999999996s)]
*  one I think you're giving him the old number one I was waiting for a round to [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2713.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah right right okay and by the way it's just not true it's just not true [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2718.32s)]
*  Joe Biden bombed them for the exact same reason the exact same way it had [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2724.32s)]
*  absolutely no impact and didn't change anything just like this won't mark my [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2729.6400000000003s)]
*  words on that by the way there's the who these are still gonna be messing with [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2734.44s)]
*  ships in the Suez like you know I don't know this is just this is pathetic he's [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2738.04s)]
*  got nothing it seems like a particularly bad move when the White [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2745.04s)]
*  House isn't otherwise denying the incident yeah and it seems like it's [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2749.52s)]
*  almost getting thrown under the bus when you get asked the question you're I mean [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2754.2799999999997s)]
*  I guess he doesn't deny it as much as he says that that guy's terrible but that's [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2758.6s)]
*  trying to deny it and you might as well own it because everyone else's and this [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2762.88s)]
*  just makes you look like more of a douche yeah yeah hey that was an epic [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2768.56s)]
*  fail and the team's gonna have to get together because clearly we need to use [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2772.32s)]
*  other platforms and protocol so that plans of this nature aren't getting in [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2776.56s)]
*  front of the media I stand in front of what we did and we obviously have to [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2781.36s)]
*  address that yeah I also the only way to respond to this look I know that the the [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2784.38s)]
*  Yemen's you know I'd have to go back and check this remember from reading it last [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2789.28s)]
*  week but Yemen's like health officials said that I think they claimed that 53 [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2794.96s)]
*  like civilians were killed something like that number and then there were [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2802.04s)]
*  like a few hundred who were wounded or something like that and you know maybe [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2807.52s)]
*  that number is not right you never know your trust in governments and government [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2811.8s)]
*  agencies our own government doesn't tell us the truth I'm not saying we should [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2815.48s)]
*  take the word of some other government but there is something that I really [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2818.8s)]
*  object to that I just hate where it's like you know Pete Hegseth having this [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2824.52s)]
*  line of like you know I'd love to talk about the precision and the you know the [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=2830.52s)]

*  mean if you're saying in your own goddamn signal messages that like yeah [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3132.9199999999996s)]
*  the time frames not really important we could do this in a month we could do [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3136.0s)]
*  this now no one's could someone clearly articulate why it had to be done what is [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3139.2799999999997s)]
*  it what did they articulate in the message the truth is the show of force [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3143.8999999999996s)]
*  to show a foot let them know who's boss just let them know we can do whatever [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3148.08s)]

*  want and you should cause no problems for it for us you know no type of [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3156.44s)]
*  thought of dealing and like what's the strategic plan here what's the best [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3162.96s)]
*  path to peace and prosperity do they have a legitimate grievance what's going [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3169.56s)]
*  is there a diplomatic solution to that none of that blow shit up and then praise [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3174.12s)]
*  our boys for blowing shit up I don't know I just don't I'll just never go [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3178.72s)]
*  along with that shit I also don't you know is Bill Maher Bill Maher got fired [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3185.72s)]
*  if you remember what he got fired for the bravery thing yeah there's like you [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3190.3199999999997s)]
*  know Bill Maher was right when he fucking said that he was absolutely right [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3194.72s)]
*  and like if that offends anybody like I don't give a shit that's fine this isn't [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3198.48s)]
*  fucking 2002 and I don't work for ABC so I get to say whatever I want but it's [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3204.6s)]
*  like if you're just talking about bravery like there's it's hard to argue [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3209.4s)]
*  that someone fighting with 19th century weapons against someone fighting with [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3215.4s)]
*  21st century weapons doesn't automatically win the bravery competition [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3222.06s)]
*  there's something braver about going after the US military with nothing than [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3227.16s)]
*  it is to be like oh what the bravery of our boys launching tomahawk missiles on [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3233.2799999999997s)]
*  the poorest country in the Middle East okay all right let's go to uh let's go [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3239.7599999999998s)]
*  to some of the the congressional testimony videos [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3248.04s)]
*  it sounds to me like your testimony today and the sector and the DNI's testimony is that there was nothing wrong at all with the signal thread that you were on that it didn't include any targeting information or battle sequence that that is your testimony that's your testimony [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3257.16s)]
*  that is your testimony that's your testimony and I'm a little staggered that that is your view director Radcliffe does the CIA have any rules about handling of classified information yes or no yes thank you director Radcliffe do you agree [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3282.16s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Pete Hexeth said this morning when asked by members of the press what had happened he said this morning in Hawaii that Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeff Goldberg is a quote deceitful and highly discredited so-called [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3304.64s)]
*  journalist who's made a profession of providing hoaxes time and time again do you share that evaluation the Secretary of Defense's evaluation of Jeff Goldberg as a journalist senator I didn't see those comments I don't know Jeff Goldberg so do you share that view of the Secretary of Defense I don't have a view on okay do you do you do you assuming that he has that view I'm curious about whether you are the CIA [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3323.48s)]
*  director okay this has happened we know it's happened did Jeff Goldberg somehow was it a did he create a hoax that allowed him to become part of this signal thread please answer the question you don't don't don't insult the intelligence of the American people [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3353.32s)]
*  did he invite himself to the signal thread I don't know how he was invited but clearly it was finish your sentence please clearly he was added to the signal group I your question is you don't know that the that the that the president's national security advisor invited him to join the signal thread everybody in America knows that [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3374.68s)]
*  does the CIA director not know that I've seen conflicting reports about who added the reporter to the signal message it's perfectly appropriate that there there was a reporter added especially one that the that the Secretary of Defense says is deceitful highly discredited a so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes over and over again do you are your testimony that it was appropriate that he was [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3404.68s)]
*  added to this signal thread no of course not and why why did you not call you are the see you're mischaracterizing my testimony you can you answered the question let me ask you when he was added to the thread you're the CIA director why didn't you call out that his he was present on the signal thread I don't know if you use signal messaging app I do I do not for classified information not for targeting [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3434.6s)]
*  well neither do I senator neither do I senator well that's what your testimony is today it absolutely is not senator were you not listening at the beginning no when I said that I was using it as permitted it is permissible to use I agree that's your testimony yeah I agree that's your testimony you asked me if I use it and I said not for targeting not for classified information and I said I don't either I also know Jeff Goldberg I don't use it to to to communicate with him [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3463.88s)]
*  but you thought it was appropriate by the way I think he's one of the more outstanding journalists in America but I'm shocked to find him on a thread that he's reading in the parking lot of a grocery store in Washington DC and your testimony as the director the CIA is that it's totally appropriate is it appropriate no that is not what I okay when did I use the word appropriate well go ahead please well I didn't that everybody [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3493.88s)]
*  in America so clearly senator here is what your testimony is no I never said that's just a normal day at the CIA where we chat about this kind of stuff over signal in fact it's so normal that the last administration left it here for us that's your testimony all right we can we can pause it here I mean look this is I don't know look obviously this is you know you're making the worst people in the world look good you know it's just one of those things like [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3523.88s)]
*  it's almost I'm sure we've all had this just like in our personal lives whether it's at work or with a friend or in a relationship or something where you just fuck up and they're just giving it to you and you're just like I just got to take this now there is just really no like your your job here now is just to get it is you guys listen obviously he's grandstanding and obviously he's trying to mischaracterize Ratcliffe's you know testimony to some degree but damn if that's not a punch that packs some weight to go you're the director of the CIA [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3553.84s)]
*  you're the head of the Central Intelligence Agency and you couldn't figure out that there was a freaking Atlantic reporter on your group chat and he's like have you ever used signal before it's like Jesus Christ I just can't believe that this is happening one day later I mean the way that I see it usually after failures it's five seven eight years later after three months of a Durham or two years of a Durham thing when when have you ever seen a day after [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3583.84s)]
*  a mess of that all these people get pulled in or at least I can't think of other examples of that off the top of my head no that's it's a good point it's a very good point and I really don't know what the answer to that is like were they coming for something unrelated and then they just made it all about this I mean that's pretty crazy that they were there right away I will say though also I haven't ever really seen like the National Security State planning a military target and it's just in the news I mean this is pretty [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3613.84s)]
*  wild dude like it's it's hard to get over that I don't know this is a pretty well reporters are in secret government signal chats yeah what else do they know right and then what was the other video I think we have the Tulsi Gabbard one just being chastised up there too did I send that or no okay maybe I thought I sent the third one too but I guess not oh no you know it was just the two okay that's fine yeah Tulsi had to take her her medicine too and she basically just wouldn't answer she was like I'm not gonna comment on another [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3643.84s)]
*  ongoing thing yeah yeah classic well I gotta say like in this case that might be the best way to handle it at Ratcliffe seems to be like no I can explain it to these guys you're like you're not having a real conversation here dude they're just making you take you know they're making you accept your punishment yeah look I don't know what else to say here I mean I would feel guys look like a bunch of assholes well I would feel like a little bit more of I would feel a little bit more motivated [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3673.84s)]
*  to say like defend the administration if you know look like the same way we've defended Doge and Elon Musk a bunch where people will say hey this isn't the correct process he's doing this in a sloppy way he's got these young you know tech guys who have all this information have we vetted that you know we don't know all these things you go okay even though some of that is legitimate criticism I don't know man they're trying to do the right thing it's vitally necessary [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3703.84s)]
*  for this to be done and none of the proper channels have a 1% chance of working it's a 0% chance that this is going to happen through the appropriate channel so you know what you gotta try something new and there might be some mistakes made along the way but at least they're trying something new if that were the case like if this was if this was a meeting where they were trying to end a war and it got lit it'd be like yeah let me defend them here okay they're using signal but you know what this is a new team they're trying but they're not they're they're just in the [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3733.84s)]
*  business of trying to defend yet another act of war in the Middle East and so what the fuck you guys it's the worst of all worlds the worst of all worlds and I gotta say and you know I don't I take no pleasure in saying this and I'll give her the slight caveat of I don't trust this journalist and not everything has been released but particularly for Tulsi Gabbard I just think it's damning that like look you could say like she's the director of national intelligence it's not exactly [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3763.84s)]
*  like she's at the Defense Department but like when the vice president's weighing in and saying I think we're making a mistake maybe Tulsi should have caught his back there and been like yeah this is kind of a mistake I mean Tulsi Gabbard at least is supposed to be good on this type of stuff you know that you know who the Houthis are enemies of by the way al-qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula that's their big enemy in Yemen outside the Saudis the Israelis and al-qaeda [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3793.84s)]
*  that's their enemy. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3823.84s)]
*  So we should team up with al-qaeda work in Syria. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3825.1200000000003s)]
*  Well I'm saying we are teaming up with al-qaeda and have been in Yemen as well as Syria and Libya and you'd think that might be one thing that Tulsi is at least good on. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3828.2200000000003s)]
*  It's time to discuss the strategic asset that we're investing in of al-qaeda. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3837.28s)]
*  Yeah really. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3841.36s)]
*  That's the that's the congressional hearing that we need is finally coming for the American people and making the al-qaeda pitch. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3842.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3850.2400000000002s)]
*  Because al-qaeda and going against them was the failures of the prior administrations. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3850.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3857.2s)]
*  Obama and Biden who did such terrible work against our best adversary I mean our best ally in the Middle East. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3858.2s)]
*  Israel. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3866.12s)]
*  Well look we could end the show on this note but there's evidently is just as we're recording the show it's the Washington Post is reporting right now that Russia and Ukraine agree to expand the [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3866.92s)]
*  partial ceasefire. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3879.86s)]
*  So you see if they could just wait one day could say after they saw the American might and who sees it feared the Russian the Ukrainians to respect. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3882.1s)]
*  Make a deal if they could have just delayed this hearing by one day and got on their story straight. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3889.82s)]
*  It more likely like look this is still America and we're ending a war and you can't really end a war so we just have to move the war. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3894.7400000000002s)]
*  No Europe only backed us because we said that if they go along with our peace agreement we would take care of their problem in Yemen. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3901.46s)]
*  No one else has the strength to do so. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3909.06s)]
*  Yeah there you go. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3910.86s)]
*  I'm for hire I get paid later. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3911.6600000000003s)]
*  All right. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3913.02s)]
*  But an absolute disaster. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3913.94s)]
*  That's our show for today. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3916.1400000000003s)]
*  All right. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3917.38s)]
*  Peace. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obL_HTtIWAU&t=3917.78s)]
