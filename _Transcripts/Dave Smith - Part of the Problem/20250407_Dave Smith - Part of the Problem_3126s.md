# Dave Smith | Sam Harris Continues to Embarrass Himself | Part Of The Problem 1250
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc)
*  What's up? What's up? How's everybody doing? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=0.0s)]
*  the problem. I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the fire Bernstein. How are you feeling buddy? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=10.92s)]
*  I'm doing well back from Colorado and a podcasting with you all as well in the world. How were [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=16.2s)]
*  the shows out there? Oh, it was a blast. It was really fun. A bunch of fans showed up [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=22.8s)]
*  for the first night, which is shocking because it's out in the middle of nowhere and it's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=27.2s)]
*  nice to have their support when you're in liberal cities and spewing my nonsense. So [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=30.72s)]
*  there's a lot of fun. I think it's the first headlining gig I've done all year and new [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=35.44s)]
*  materials cooking along. So I enjoyed it. Hell yeah, dude. I'm glad to hear that. Yeah, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=38.84s)]
*  I'm out here at the Nashville Comedy Festival having a good time. I got the kid rock show [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=45.0s)]
*  tonight. So I'm just thinking he brought Bill Maher to meet Trump. Maybe that's maybe I [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=51.64s)]
*  could stop this whole thing. We don't need to go to war with the ran. Come on now. And [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=57.68s)]
*  then is, is kid rock going to be there? I believe so. I think he's hosting the show. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  That's so funny to be in a room with kid rock and think I have to talk politics to this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  guy. They're like, this is my in, I better get this guy's ear because he might have some [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=70.88s)]
*  influence. There is no nothing better describes the state of America than that. It was just [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=79.84s)]
*  perfect that you just go like, you go, okay, this is serious. I'm meeting kid rock tonight. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  This is a real opportunity to fucking move the needle here. Yeah. Yeah, it is so, so [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=93.72s)]
*  bizarre. It's also bizarre. Anyway, it's been it's been a fun week. I got a you know, I [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=99.84s)]
*  coming off the week after a Rogan appearance is always just, you know, like a nutty thing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=110.36s)]
*  It's really unbelievable. There's just no I do so many shows, but there's just nothing like [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=115.08s)]
*  Rogan's show, the reaction to it, how how like, and it's like, it doesn't even make sense, like [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=120.6s)]
*  the numbers don't even quite justify it. Like, it's the biggest show, but it's not like you'd [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=127.88s)]
*  think doing Piers Morgan or doing Tucker should Okay, maybe it's only a third of the reaction, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=132.76s)]
*  but it's not anything like that. It's like Rogan is just like 1000 times more than any other show. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=137.24s)]
*  You just every little thing you've said gets put under a microscope. And you know, it's weird for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=142.84s)]
*  me, it took like, this time, it was almost like I was like, Oh, wow, this is actually the response [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  was pretty tame. It was just all positive things until around the 48 hour mark. And then everybody [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  jumped up the, the thing that I said that I tend to agree with Darrell Cooper on his assessment [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  of World War Two, which is I will say this. And I mean, this, it's like a, in a friendly competition [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=163.08s)]
*  type way that it bothers me so much, that Darrell generated so much more controversy than I've ever [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=171.08s)]
*  generated in any of my appearances. Like, Oh, man, it eats at me. It's like, come on, dude, I was on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=179.88000000000002s)]
*  fuck, I think I did two Tuckers and like 15 Joe Rogan's before he did one of each. And he just [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=185.4s)]
*  buried me, buried me with how controversial it was. And then to throw salt in the wound, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=191.64s)]
*  my controversy from my latest Joe Rogan appearance is that I said, I kind of agree with Darrell Cooper. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  It's just like, Oh, they're just mocking me with this. If it's like, come on, I've said lots of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  crazy shit. I must've said crazier shit than any of that. Well, I've said it before. I don't think [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=208.6s)]
*  that you say crazy or take irresponsible enough opinions. And it's time to ramp up on your [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=213.56s)]
*  antisemitism. So let the market, you know, it's really about you. I gotta go further than Darrell, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=219.08s)]
*  whatever he says, I gotta just take the crazier position. I'd be like, dad, he's soft. That guy, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=226.84s)]
*  please. He says both sides were bad. No, excuse me. One side was good. Anyway, it's great. So [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=234.52s)]
*  then today, I woke up to see that, once again, much like the last time I was on, I got a response [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=241.96s)]
*  from Sam Harris, which I do just, you know, I guess it's my guilty pleasure or whatever. But [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=251.16s)]
*  it's like, I know on some level that Sam Harris is like, just totally humiliated himself and is kind [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  of irrelevant. But at the same time, the thing on Twitter like blew the fuck up and it was trending [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=264.36s)]
*  and it was a whole thing. So it's kind of like, well, I can't not respond. He also talks like [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=272.04s)]
*  he's the world authority. He lays it out if you need to respond to him. Yeah, it really, well, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=277.24s)]
*  that is true. So maybe I'm falling into his trap, but I do just, you know, I responded with just one [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=283.0s)]
*  little jab on Twitter. And then, you know, then I get people going like, oh, we'll actually respond [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=289.48s)]
*  to what he's saying or something like that. So like, okay, here we go. Even though he's not [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=295.64s)]
*  saying much, it's just, it's like, there's something guilty about, it just feels like every time he [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=299.88s)]
*  says something about me, I just find myself in the position of feeling like I'm dunking on a [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=306.92s)]
*  retarded third grader. And then you dunk on retarded third grader once. And it's like, I don't [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=312.2s)]
*  know, it's like being a cannibal, like you get a taste for it. And you're like, that's the most fun [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=317.8s)]
*  thing I've ever done in my life. But it does feel like probably I should, you know, be trying against [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=321.16s)]
*  someone a little bigger, but like, I don't know, it's Sam Harris. So like, fuck it, I guess I got [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  to respond to it. Anyway, third grader doesn't even know that you dunked on him. So it's no harm, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=330.12s)]
*  no foul. Yeah, I guess there you go. So anyway, I should tell you, this is going to be a little [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=335.64s)]
*  bit of a shorter episode. I do apologize for that. But I got to rush out, I got to get something to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=342.12s)]
*  eat and then get to these shows. And then I got a early flight in the morning. But so let's start [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=346.12s)]
*  with this. Let's let's just play the Sam Harris clip and then we could tear it apart. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=352.52s)]
*  Joe is a genuinely good guy who wants good things for people. But he is honestly in over his head [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  on so many topics of great consequence, right? When he brings someone on to just shoot the shit [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  about, you know, how the Holocaust is not what you think it was, right? Or, you know, maybe Churchill's [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=377.0s)]
*  the bad guy in World War Two. Just pause it already. Or he's got Dave Smith, you know. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, pause it and bring it back a little bit so we can hear the part about me. But like, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=389.08s)]
*  it's just there's just no other way to like describe this. It is intense dishonesty. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=393.32s)]
*  I mean, just like it again, it's the thing that I always say, like I was really confronted with [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=402.68s)]
*  when I debated Chris Cuomo. There's I've been, you know, I've had this experience, like on Twitter [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=408.2s)]
*  and stuff like that. But that kind of almost feels like it's a it's a whole different beast. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=414.44s)]
*  But there is something about like that I think I think a lot of people who are decent people, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=418.84s)]
*  regular people, almost have a tough time because there is like a naivete that comes along with [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=426.44s)]
*  innocence or something like that, where you're just like, oh, you're just a fucking liar. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=432.52s)]
*  You're just very comfortable just lying through your teeth. Like, who are you talking about here? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=438.44s)]
*  He's alluding to Darrell Cooper, I guess. But like, has Darrell Cooper ever gone on a show and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=444.12s)]
*  told you to rethink the Holocaust? The Holocaust wasn't really what it was. Like, nobody's done [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=449.96s)]
*  that. You know, the point, which, by the way, I made the point, by the way, the craziest part [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=455.88s)]
*  of unroguing. So I say on the show, and I was like, yo, I'm like, totally making this so clear [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=461.48s)]
*  that no one's going to be able to fuck with what I'm saying right now, because I'm making such a [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=469.8s)]
*  narrow point. But I went, I went, look, like, when Darrell Cooper was on Tucker Carlson's show, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=473.4s)]
*  the thing he said that generated all this, this outrage was he goes, he goes, you know, I say this [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=479.79999999999995s)]
*  to my my buddy sometimes to kind of prod at him. And, you know, he's an Anglo. So he takes this [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  stuff, you know, personally, and I'm being hyperbolic when I say it. But I say to him, I go, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=491.23999999999995s)]
*  you know, Churchill was the real villain of the war. And then he caveats it again and goes, now, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=495.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm not saying he committed the most atrocities or killed the most people, but he was most [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=500.52s)]
*  responsible from this thing going from being a war in Poland to being the worst thing that ever [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=504.2s)]
*  happened in the history of the world that we now know as World War Two. And then everyone who [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=510.68s)]
*  responds to that goes, he said Churchill was the real villain of the war. And you're like, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=516.12s)]
*  this is just already so dishonest. Like, you know, when someone says they're being hyperbolic, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=521.3199999999999s)]
*  the point he's clearly making is like, Churchill mishandled the war. OK, so take on that argument. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=526.12s)]
*  But then so then anyway, people still just clipped that and went Dave saying Churchill was the real [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=533.24s)]
*  villain. Like, like, Jesus Christ, dude, the levels of dishonesty are just crazy. But Sam will just [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=538.92s)]
*  go a step further and go, he's telling people to question the Holocaust. Just made it up. He knows [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=546.36s)]
*  that's not true. He knows nobody said that. Ian Carroll didn't say that. Daryl Cupertons say that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=553.72s)]
*  Has anyone ever gone on Joe Rogan's show and said, hey, listen, man, let's really look into this. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=558.76s)]
*  Like, the numbers don't add up to six million or something like that. Is that ever? No, it's never [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=563.24s)]
*  happened. But they'll just say that intentionally to just poison the well so that you already think [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=568.0400000000001s)]
*  of this is just like, oh, these are really bad people who are clearly sympathetic to Adolf Hitler [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=574.6s)]
*  and clearly don't believe like either they don't believe he committed these crimes or they're all [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=578.36s)]
*  for that he committed these crimes. You know, it's just I don't know what else to say about just [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=582.28s)]
*  intensely dishonest the because he's a liar. Let's keep going. Or to talk or he's got Dave Smith, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=586.12s)]
*  you know, being treated as an expert on on the Israel and and Palestine and the history of that [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  conflict and the moral emergency that that came to the world's attention on October 7th [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=608.76s)]
*  and what is appropriate to think in the aftermath of all of that. Right. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=616.76s)]
*  Dave Smith is the only reason why anyone knows what Dave Smith thinks about any of this is very [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=620.68s)]
*  likely because Joe had him on multiple times to talk about it. Right. You know, he's a pure [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=627.24s)]
*  misinformation artist and and you know, on top of many others. OK, Joe talks to someone like. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=633.16s)]
*  OK, OK, I'm a pure misinformation artist. I mean, Sam just started this with a fucking [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=643.0s)]
*  blatant lie. I mean, why is that not misinformation? Like, God damn, like, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=650.76s)]
*  hasn't that term just been discredited enough along with Sam Harris and his fucking reputation? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=654.76s)]
*  But like I'm the disinformation misinformation. What did he say? Specialist. OK, I mean, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=660.52s)]
*  artist. OK, you just started this by saying that who is questioning the Holocaust? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=667.72s)]
*  So how am I pushing misinformation? And then, you know, look, like I said about this last time [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=674.6s)]
*  when he he does the exact same thing, it's like. I mean, look, I'm not I'm not the expert. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=680.28s)]
*  I'm not. And if people have a perception about me that I'm like the expert on on the history of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=687.96s)]
*  Israel, Palestine, we're like, I mean, I don't know, I'm explicitly telling you that I'm not. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=695.72s)]
*  And so if you have that impression, then I don't know what to say. But, you know, the thing about [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  it is, is that really I don't have to be the expert because it's really easy to poke holes in Sam [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  Harris and other liars bullshit. I just know enough to poke holes in all your bullshit. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=715.56s)]
*  That's essentially it. You don't need to be an expert to do that in the same way as I'm not. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=720.92s)]
*  I wasn't a fucking, you know, a virologist, but I could tell you that Sam Harris was full of shit [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=724.92s)]
*  the whole time about covid. You know, I wasn't I could tell you that lockdowns were going to [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=732.52s)]
*  have way bigger costs than benefits because you don't really need to be an expert to do that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=736.76s)]
*  And what he means when when he says that, you know, we I'm presented as an expert is mean me [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=742.2s)]
*  and Joe have conversations. That's really what's happening here. He's furious about it because the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=750.12s)]
*  shit I'm saying is resonating with people. I do have really good arguments. You don't have to be [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=756.2800000000001s)]
*  an expert to have really great arguments, as it turns out. I'm proof of that. And so, you know, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=761.48s)]
*  then for him to go on and say that so this was the only thing I said on Twitter that I was like, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=768.4399999999999s)]
*  Sam is correct that the only reason people know who I am is because of Joe Rogan. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=773.4s)]
*  And I said I really should have earned it the good old fashioned way by having my mother create the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=778.92s)]
*  Golden Girls. I just do think there's something there's something funny about, you know, someone [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=782.92s)]
*  born with a silver spoon telling somebody else who's like a self-made guy that they really are. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=790.04s)]
*  The only reason anyone knows who you are is because of Joe Rogan's like, first of all, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=795.96s)]
*  that's a huge reason why people know who you are, Sam Harris. That's also like, so what? Yeah, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=800.6800000000001s)]
*  that's right. That's right. Joe Rogan blew me up. That is true. Okay. The only reason why people [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=806.84s)]
*  know who Jerry Seinfeld is, is because of Johnny Carson. You know, the only reason why people know [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=814.36s)]
*  who almost everybody is, is because they got some type of break. But the point is, then you got to [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=819.32s)]
*  do something with it. And so if I hadn't done, there's lots of people have been on Rogan who [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=824.2s)]
*  didn't, you know, like get a big audience afterwards because they didn't do anything with [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=828.5200000000001s)]
*  the opportunity. So anyway, this is all, it's all just so pathetic and stupid. But you're like, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=831.88s)]
*  hey, if I'm such a misinformation artist, Sam, so take on one thing I said. Like, it's unbelievable. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=837.24s)]
*  These people don't feel the need. Like they think they could still play in this dumb old game where [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=845.1600000000001s)]
*  you just smear someone, but you have nothing. So fucking take on one thing I said. It should be [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=849.72s)]
*  easy since I'm, you know, maybe I'm just such a talented artist that you can't figure it, but like, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=857.1600000000001s)]
*  what's the misinformation? What have I gotten wrong? And then immediately, you know, the way he, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=861.8000000000001s)]
*  it's so funny because so many of the people who would kind of like position themselves as being [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=867.88s)]
*  critics of like the woke progressive regime, but then they have the exact same attitudes that like [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=872.0400000000001s)]
*  the way he said it, the what would be appropriate to think after the moral crisis of October 7th or [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=878.4399999999999s)]
*  whatever. It's like, yeah, I know Sam, it sucks that you don't get to be the dictator of what the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=886.5999999999999s)]
*  rest of us are allowed to think and talk about. But this is a new day. This is a new world. And [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=891.3199999999999s)]
*  if you want to come, if you want to come take me down, then you got to make an argument, dude. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=897.64s)]
*  Something. What did I get wrong? Point to something I got wrong. You want me to point to [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=903.96s)]
*  something you got wrong, Sam, with your dumb fucking, oh, if you change all the variables [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=910.2s)]
*  about COVID and the vaccine, then I would have been right. It's like, yeah, but when you don't [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=915.8s)]
*  change the variables, you were fucking wrong, dude. It's like, I don't know. You said you wouldn't, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=919.56s)]
*  you said you didn't care if Joe Biden had children's corpses in his basement. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=924.36s)]
*  But I'm, I'm the, the misinformation artist. I mean, what, I don't know, Rob, what else can I [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=930.36s)]
*  say to this here? He's not making an argument. People are like, Oh, you just insulted him back. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=935.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, excuse me. What, what am I supposed to grapple with here? What argument am I supposed [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=940.6s)]
*  to contend with? He asserts that I'm a misinformation artist. I would say, I don't think I am. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=945.56s)]
*  I don't know any thoughts on this, Rob. Yeah. That's what stood out to me the most. We've done [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=953.0799999999999s)]
*  a number of episodes on this show where someone says something and then we take on what they said [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=956.36s)]
*  and tell you why it's wrong. We haven't done all that many episodes where we just go, Hey, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=960.12s)]
*  this guy's an idiot. And look, he doesn't have their credentials to discuss this. And so [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=964.2s)]
*  don't listen to him. Just take it for just believe me that I'm right. And that that more popular [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=968.36s)]
*  person is wrong. We've never done that. And so that's what really stood out to me is that if [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=973.8000000000001s)]
*  you wanted to take on what you said on the show, as opposed to just going, Hey, it's reprehensible. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=978.36s)]
*  And why does this person look to as an authority? And particularly if you want to defend Israel and [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=983.0s)]
*  Israel's current actions, and you think that you're such a dummy about what you had to say about it, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=987.56s)]
*  why not give us the breakdown? I mean, if you're so smart and so right, why not contend with what [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=992.28s)]
*  was said on the show? You got three hours of, uh, Dave Smith talking about Israel, not quite, maybe [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=997.0s)]
*  an hour and a half on Joe Rogan. And then you've got 72 other hours from debates. I mean, you could, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1002.2s)]
*  I could summarize the top five points for you. And then you could take them on. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1007.96s)]
*  Do an episode. That's an interesting episode. Do one, take on one point. One thing I said, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1012.36s)]
*  it is there's something real strange about this, uh, this whole appeal to authority that is all [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1019.0s)]
*  Sam Harris has on the authority. And based off of what, who credentialed you as the authority? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1024.68s)]
*  Well, that's the thing, right? It's like, first of all, it's like, so Sam Harris, Sam Harris, Mr. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1030.6s)]
*  rational, logical thinker, Mr. against emotional thinking and for, you know, like grounded, sober, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1036.68s)]
*  rational thought, all he can cling to is a fucking logical fallacy and the appeal to authority as if [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1042.92s)]
*  that means you're left. But then you realize like how much this, this argument falls apart. Like, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1049.8s)]
*  first of all, Sam Harris, from what I understand as a neurologist, I mean, I think Brett Weinstein's [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1054.3600000000001s)]
*  like made a whole argument about how he's not even that. Like he got, I don't really know. I [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1060.52s)]
*  don't remember. He explained it to me once, but I don't really remember. But whatever, let's just [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1064.28s)]
*  say it's like, okay, so fucking, so you're a neurologist. Well, we're not, we're not talking [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1068.28s)]
*  about fucking anything in your field of expertise here, right? So are you allowed? Are you allowed [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1075.16s)]
*  to have an opinion on Israel, Palestine? Oh, that's convenient. You are allowed. Well, you're not a [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1081.72s)]
*  fucking Israeli historian or a Palestinian historian. You're not the expert in this field. You [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1087.0s)]
*  know, like it'd be one thing, it'd still be a logical fallacy, but it would at least be a more [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1091.88s)]
*  digestible one. If like Benny Morris was like, I'm only talking to other historians who have written [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1097.8000000000002s)]
*  volumes of books and have, you know what I mean? Like have dug through the primary sources and the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1106.92s)]
*  firsthand accounts themselves. That's all you need to go. Okay. Well, at least like the guy has [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1113.96s)]
*  expertise in this area and he's only going to talk to other people with expertise in the area. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1117.72s)]
*  By the way, he doesn't take that position, but I'm just saying like that would at least be more [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1121.88s)]
*  reasonable than you. Who the fuck are you? Some shit like I'm gonna, you know, if you're, if you're [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1125.08s)]
*  writing a book about how the human brain works, then okay, fine. You know, which I read his book [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1132.04s)]
*  years ago on that topic. I actually kind of liked it. But like, okay, that's one thing, but you're [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1137.16s)]
*  not, you're not in your realm of expertise at all. So who are you to dictate who the fuck everybody [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1143.16s)]
*  else gets to have a conversation with? And that is to be clear, that is what Sam Harris is complaining [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1149.4s)]
*  about, that other people are having conversations and they're recording them and putting them out [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1155.0s)]
*  for people to watch them. That's his, okay. So take it apart then, you know, like, I don't know, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1160.44s)]
*  you know, I, my mom, a little bit about my family history, did not create the Golden Girls. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1167.0s)]
*  I was not born into millions of dollars. I did not have all of the advantages in life that Sam Harris [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1174.2s)]
*  does. And I built, you know, my following and we built our show during what I would argue was an [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1181.0s)]
*  age of pervasive misinformation. We're up, we're up again, we're basically taking on the corporate [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1190.6s)]
*  media, which is a, a multi-billion dollar industry that is permeated by what I would call [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1197.8s)]
*  misinformation artists. Okay. And, you know, like if I'm correct about this, then man, this isn't [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1204.9199999999998s)]
*  just like one guy who went on a podcast a few times. This was like this entire apparatus. And [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1214.2s)]
*  you know what we had to do was we had to tear apart their arguments over and over and over again. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1220.68s)]
*  That's what we had to do and make like compelling tight arguments for why the claims that they're [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1227.32s)]
*  making are bullshit. I didn't just get to say, oh, they're all misinformation artists. So [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1232.8400000000001s)]
*  shut them down or whatever the, the end goal here is. It's like, no, you have to actually take them [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1238.04s)]
*  on. You have to, you know, take on what they said. How many hours have we spent doing this, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1244.4399999999998s)]
*  playing the clips, responding to the claim, doing research on the, like, oh, it's like Sam Harris [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1249.32s)]
*  just feels like he can do none of that. And then just say, I'm above all of it. That's fucking lame. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1254.6s)]
*  And there's a reason why this shit doesn't resonate with people. Okay. Let's keep playing [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1262.84s)]
*  the rest of the clip. Cause there's a few little bits in here that were great. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1269.08s)]
*  Trump or Tucker Carlson or, you know, any of these other guys who, who lie as freely as they breathe [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1272.92s)]
*  and doesn't push back against any of their lives. In fact, in Trump's case really fairly energetically [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1281.16s)]
*  helped put his lives into, into the most plausible possible shape. It is irresponsible. I mean, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1288.28s)]
*  it is directly harmful. Our society is as politically shattered as it is in part because [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1296.36s)]
*  of how Joe has interacted with information. Again, I don't think this is, I think a lot of [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1302.84s)]
*  this is inadvertent or maybe all, you know, all of it's in his body. But it's, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1309.56s)]
*  it's just his constant theme is that there needs to be a class of people that are lording above you. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1316.28s)]
*  And I should be that class of person. Very convenient. Yeah. That's truly his narrative. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1323.4s)]
*  It's just an appeal to society. Can't just have freedom. There needs to be someone who can [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1330.68s)]
*  actually orchestrate, make decisions, disseminate the information. And then conveniently, I guess, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1335.08s)]
*  the process should just be Sam or whoever Sam anoints for that, for that role. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1341.32s)]
*  Yeah. Again, which I think we've made this point before, and I don't say this as like a, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1347.9599999999998s)]
*  a blind lover of democracy, but there does seem to be something so inherently anti-democratic [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1353.3999999999999s)]
*  in this worldview that like what everybody's just too stupid to figure it out, except for you and, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1359.8799999999999s)]
*  and a small cabal of people. The rest of us are all just too dumb that like, man, if Joe Rogan's [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1365.96s)]
*  allowing lies to be told on his podcast, then, you know, I guess we'll all be fooled into believing [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1371.64s)]
*  them. And then so then how can you trust people to have the right to vote? This is like a total [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1378.3600000000001s)]
*  argument for aristocracy, right? Like that, that, okay, like the common person just isn't smart [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1383.32s)]
*  enough to figure all this shit out. And however you feel about that argument, I don't think Sam [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1388.8400000000001s)]
*  Harris would be comfortable making it. But again, these are all just, there's nothing here. There's [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1394.28s)]
*  nothing. There's not even an attempt to even pretend to be making an argument. It's just [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1402.68s)]
*  assertion after assertion after assertion. So, you know, there's a little bit of psychoanalyzing, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1407.96s)]
*  like maybe Rogan's not doing this intentionally, but he's allowing all these lies. He's taking [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1415.32s)]
*  Donald Trump's lies and putting them in the most plausible shape or whatever. It's like, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1421.0s)]
*  again, to say that, like, if you're looking at how fractured our system is, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1426.2s)]
*  and looking at how fractured our politics are, to even put some of that blame on Joe Rogan, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1433.48s)]
*  and then it's not to not even look at like, okay, but why is it? Why is it that we're even talking [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1441.0s)]
*  about Joe Rogan in this conversation at all? You know, like, what is happening? Show me in some way, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1447.96s)]
*  like, I'm not saying you could scientifically prove this, but if you're going to make the point [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1455.24s)]
*  that Joe Rogan allows lies on his podcast, it's like, compared to what? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1459.08s)]
*  Compared to the corporate media? I mean, like, you just, look, I said this when I was on the show [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1466.2s)]
*  with Joe just the other day, but it is wild to think. And I'm a little bit like, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1473.72s)]
*  you know, just happen to be the guy in the room for this. It's not a little bit. I just happen to [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1481.24s)]
*  be the guy in the room for this. But I did remind Joe, and I go, dude, how crazy is it? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1486.12s)]
*  Four years ago, as long ago as that sounds, or less than four years ago, because three years [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1493.24s)]
*  and change ago, right? The fucking huge controversy from our podcast was Joe Rogan [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1498.68s)]
*  telling young people to be healthy. Like, I'm not exaggerating when I say this. I mean, this made it [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1507.3200000000002s)]
*  all the way to the president of the United States of America had to condemn the podcast that I was [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1514.2s)]
*  on because Joe Rogan advised young people to be healthy. Now, like, the point I'm making here is [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1521.48s)]
*  that if you, I would any day, I would do any debate, any trial, whatever, against any person [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1529.8s)]
*  with any judge, with any moderator, like whatever you want. And I will take, we will take the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1541.24s)]
*  corporate media's track record on COVID versus Joe Rogan's track record on COVID. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1547.72s)]
*  And I will defend Joe Rogan. I mean, there is just no, like, again, these things that were [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1553.48s)]
*  seen as wildly controversial today, nobody, including Fauci or Biden, if either of them can [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1557.64s)]
*  still, you know, have functioning brains, nobody would argue that it's controversial to tell young [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1565.56s)]
*  people to be healthy. They wouldn't even try, you know? So to sit here and just be like, oh, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1570.3600000000001s)]
*  Joe Rogan is interviewing this misinformation artist and he's not pushing back or whatever. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1575.56s)]
*  It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, compared to what, dude? In the grand scheme of things, in the issue, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1581.0s)]
*  which I think there's really no, no matter what side of it you're on, I don't think you can argue [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1585.8799999999999s)]
*  that COVID wasn't the most consequential set of policies in Western civilization over the last [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1591.8799999999999s)]
*  few years. So on the most important issue, just objectively speaking, he got it so much more [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1600.36s)]
*  correct than the entire corporate media apparatus, than any of them. You were so much better off [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1608.28s)]
*  listening to Joe Rogan through all of COVID than you were listening to any show on NBC, ABC, CBS, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1615.9599999999998s)]
*  MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, than reading anything about it in the New York Times or the Washington Post [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1623.24s)]
*  or the Wall Street Journal. You were way better off listening to Joe Rogan's podcast. Now, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1628.84s)]
*  the aspect that Sam Harris is correct about in all of this is that, and I think Joe would be [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1636.84s)]
*  the first one to admit this, that that is fucking ridiculous. Yes, it is fucking ridiculous that [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1643.32s)]
*  you'd be better off listening to Joe Rogan than listening to the CDC. That's insane. We're all on [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1651.6399999999999s)]
*  the same page here, Sam. We think it's crazy, too. We think it's crazy that you'd be better off [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1658.2s)]
*  listening to our show than listening to anybody in the corporate media. But that's the reality. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1662.8400000000001s)]
*  Don't blame us for that. We're as unhappy with it as all of you are. We would also like there to be [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1667.96s)]
*  experts who got a thing right every now and then, but there aren't. I mean, there are, but they're [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1673.48s)]
*  few and far between, and they get drummed out of the establishment pretty quickly. So again, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1678.3600000000001s)]
*  it's like this weird thing where, look, we all think it's ridiculous that this conversation is [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1685.32s)]
*  left to us, but it is left to us. And you're not looking at the reason why that is. This is what [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1689.6399999999999s)]
*  Jimmy Dora always says all the time, but he's like, yeah, it's insane. It's insane. I'm an idiot [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1697.1599999999999s)]
*  comedian, and I'm better than all these guys. So anyway, here, let's keep going. I thought there [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1701.3999999999999s)]
*  was also something telling about what he said here, which is this is the first argument I've heard [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1706.9199999999998s)]
*  is that the reason why Joe Rogan is dangerous is because he doesn't have the tools to challenge [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1712.12s)]
*  people. And so when he platform Donald Trump, he actually gave him the best vehicle for shaping [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1717.8s)]
*  and forming his ideas. What you're overlooking is that Kamala Harris could have gone on the show, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1722.6799999999998s)]
*  but was such a moron, she didn't feel comfortable talking honestly, because actually the democratic [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1727.7199999999998s)]
*  propaganda probably wouldn't hold up in the Joe Rogan environment of just a guy sitting there and [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1733.56s)]
*  wanting to ask some clarifying questions and not just giving you a fluff piece 45 minute interview. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1738.44s)]
*  So yeah, I'm just saying the one argument that he's putting forward here, which is, hey, this [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1744.1200000000001s)]
*  platform is no good. It's actually a better vehicle for honest conversations. And that doesn't [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1748.1200000000001s)]
*  serve the Democrats well because they're working with more bullshit and propaganda. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1753.3200000000002s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Proton Mail. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1757.56s)]
*  Proton Mail is an email service by Proton designed to replace your Gmail account for all of your [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1762.44s)]
*  important stuff so that you can have a more secure emailing experience. Your Gmail is full of junk [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1768.52s)]
*  after so many years. Proton Mail is a great way to start over again. Hit the reset button on your [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1774.44s)]
*  email. I know my inbox is a mess. You can continue using your Gmail for garbage, but use Proton Mail [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1780.44s)]
*  for the important stuff. Proton will always have a freemium version and you can later change to a [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1787.0s)]
*  paid product if you're convinced about the product's benefits to you. You can create an account [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1792.52s)]
*  right now today for free. Go check them out. Proton Mail, a more secure way to do emailing, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1797.96s)]
*  and they have all the benefits that Gmail has. So get rid of that and switch over to Proton. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1804.68s)]
*  All right, let's get back on the show. Well, yeah, that's a great point. And [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1809.08s)]
*  you know, and this is really where the term Trump Derangement Syndrome really does make sense, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1814.28s)]
*  is also just imagine the pretzels that one would have to contort themselves into in order to just [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1822.6s)]
*  have the mentality that you're like, well, look, dude, if Donald Trump got pushback, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1831.0s)]
*  then that might have like exposed him. He is, there is just, I'm sorry, again, this is just [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1838.2800000000002s)]
*  like, you know, we can all have our own opinions, but we can't have our own facts. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1844.2s)]
*  Objectively speaking, he is the most scrutinized, the most detested, the most like, the target of [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1847.8000000000002s)]
*  the corporate media since he came down the escalator. Before that, they were cool with them, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1858.5200000000002s)]
*  but since he started running for president, he has just been the most like scrutinized isn't [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1863.64s)]
*  even the word. Opposed, the most opposed in every single step along this line. So the idea that like, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1869.32s)]
*  what like, someone in America just hasn't heard anyone pushing back against Donald Trump yet, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1877.72s)]
*  and if they had that would have what like, the wheels would have come off of this thing. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1884.92s)]
*  It is, it's delusional. I mean, it's like that's why I think people call it like a derangement [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1889.6399999999999s)]
*  syndrome, because it is like you are, you're, you hate Donald Trump so much that you want to like, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1897.8s)]
*  like the cognitive dissonance that it generates to see him like doing well and actually improving [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1906.52s)]
*  on his, you know, broad support. It is so difficult that you have to come up with these [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1912.52s)]
*  justifications for why it is. And of course, you have to blame everybody else yourself. You're, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1918.76s)]
*  you can't be the person who you scrutinize to see like, oh, maybe I played a role in this, maybe the [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1923.6399999999999s)]
*  establishment that I'm champion, maybe they played a role in this. So instead, it's got to be everybody [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1929.8799999999999s)]
*  else's fault. But like, imagine that like, does anybody think like, what if Rogan had just handled [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1934.28s)]
*  it like CNN, then what? It would have been the same waste of time that every single show on CNN [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1940.52s)]
*  is. It's just, it's all so absurd. Now here, let's play the last little bit of this, because [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1948.68s)]
*  this was actually maybe the best part of the whole thing. It is also avoidable, right? He could [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1952.44s)]
*  actually take the responsibility that really is his to take at this point, to get his facts straight [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1964.52s)]
*  and have someone other than Jamie there riding shotgun with him where he could have two brilliant [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1970.68s)]
*  journalists whose full-time job, he could pay each of them a million dollars a year just to sit there [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1977.56s)]
*  and do, and make sure he doesn't put his foot in his mouth in a colossally irresponsible way. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1985.0s)]
*  Right? I mean, it's like he, it's, it would be very simple to do a better job. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1992.76s)]
*  Yeah. So just, I mean, imagine, just imagine those words coming out of your mouth. I mean, talk about [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=1999.96s)]
*  being just removed from reality as an understatement, like catapulted into another stratosphere from [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2005.48s)]
*  reality. I mean, it is, you know, yeah, imagine if only that, if only we had a couple of journalists [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2013.72s)]
*  fact checking and calling out misinformation that would change, that would really change the [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2022.84s)]
*  landscape. Right, Rob? Do we haven't, we haven't had that, which, which brilliant journalists are [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2028.6000000000001s)]
*  you talking about here? You know, like, and by the way, like, I guess I'm not like in theory, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2035.56s)]
*  if Rogan wanted to do that, like have two brilliant people who were fact checking, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2041.08s)]
*  or maybe that's a good idea, but like, who are you talking about, Sam? What the same, the same [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2045.24s)]
*  corporate journalist fact checkers who are at CNN and MSNBC, they should be able to Joe Rogan [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2052.2799999999997s)]
*  experience too. That sounds like a great recipe to make people not want to listen to the show [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2057.0s)]
*  anymore. The whole point is that we've all rejected you. This is the thing, Sam, like the same way you [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2061.08s)]
*  started this video when you said Joe Rogan is having people denying the Holocaust on the show. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2068.68s)]
*  Remember, remember that? Remember how you're a fucking liar? Okay, we've all assessed this shit, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2073.7999999999997s)]
*  and we've come to the conclusion that you're a fucking liar. We don't trust you. That's why [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2080.2799999999997s)]
*  people are trust Joe Rogan more. Like, this is the whole thing. And you can't, it's just like, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2087.3999999999996s)]
*  you got to pretend that none of that exists. You go, oh yeah, we could hire a couple of [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2094.12s)]
*  journalists to be fact checkers. Again, the distrust in the corporate media was not always like this. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2098.8399999999997s)]
*  They had the biggest head start that you could imagine. Joe Rogan put a couple of microphones up [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2108.12s)]
*  in like an old office area in California and started just talking to it and posting grainy [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2117.24s)]
*  video footage online. That's how the show started. All of these big companies that we're talking [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2128.4399999999996s)]
*  about had skyscrapers in American cities all around the country and budgets in the tens of [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2137.16s)]
*  billions of dollars. You had all the advantages in the world with all your journalists and all [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2143.48s)]
*  your fact checkers and all trying to control misinformation. And when you had that, you lied [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2148.36s)]
*  through your teeth, just like Sam Harris started his video here lying through his fucking teeth, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2153.8s)]
*  so much. And so to such an absurd extent that everybody figured it out. Everybody figured out [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2158.76s)]
*  that you're not to be trusted. And so now they don't trust you. And it is true that Joe is kind [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2167.56s)]
*  of, I was going to say he's a regular guy. I mean, okay, he's not a regular guy. He's a fucking [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2177.64s)]
*  phenomenon. And again, however you feel about Joe Rogan, I am a little biased. I love the guy. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2184.04s)]
*  But he's a dude who's like a black belt across multiple martial arts and is the number one [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2192.68s)]
*  MMA commentator of all time. And he's a huge, one of the most successful comedians of all time. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2201.16s)]
*  He's got the number one podcast ever. He's not a regular guy, but he is a regular guy in the way [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2206.6s)]
*  that he approaches conversations. And he is like, you know what I mean? That is just like, hey, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2215.56s)]
*  let's just talk. Let's just be a couple. And so there is some truth to that, that he'll dive into [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2220.28s)]
*  areas and have conversations about things and not be claiming to be the expert or the authority in [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2226.84s)]
*  them. But again, it's like, do you not get that? That's what people found refreshing about it, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2232.84s)]
*  is that he's not fucking lying. He's authentic. He is who he is. And that's why he's the number [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2238.1200000000003s)]
*  one show. It's funny that a lot of these people, when they're trying to go after Joe, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2244.2s)]
*  they talk about it almost in a way that leftists talk about economics. They talk about it almost [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2251.3999999999996s)]
*  like it's a given that he's the number one show. And so it's like, well, now being the number one [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2258.68s)]
*  show, you got to do it this way, this way, and this way. But it's like, no, he's the number one [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2263.8799999999997s)]
*  show because he doesn't take advice from people like Sam Harris. That's why. And that's it. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2267.56s)]
*  Again, throughout all of this, and please, if he's done it in some area, please, somebody point me [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2274.2s)]
*  to it and I'll be happy to actually take on something that has a little bit of substance. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2280.9199999999996s)]
*  He hasn't offered anything so far. But for calling Joe Rogan somebody who platforms [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2285.24s)]
*  misinformation artists or somebody who allows people to lie, is there ever an onus on you to [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2292.04s)]
*  ever explain one of them? One example? Like, it's just even when he says get some brilliant [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2297.0s)]
*  journalists, like who? Like, give me an example of one. Give me an example of the misinformation. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2304.12s)]
*  Give me an example of the lie that Joe allowed someone to get away with. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2308.76s)]
*  But it's so bizarre to me to be able to make a video like this and not feel any pressure [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2315.16s)]
*  to do that. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2321.08s)]
*  Tax Network USA. Look, as we know, the IRS is the largest collection agency in the world, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2325.56s)]
*  and it just stepped up enforcement for 2025. So if you owe back taxes or have unfiled returns, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2331.96s)]
*  do not wait for the IRS to come after you. Simply avoiding your tax troubles is the worst thing you [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2338.2s)]
*  can do. Getting ahead of this is the smart move, but never, never contact the IRS alone. Turn it [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2343.72s)]
*  over to the team at Tax Network USA because not all tax resolution companies are the same. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2350.2s)]
*  Tax Network USA has a preferred direct line to the IRS. That means they know which agents to deal [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2355.48s)]
*  with and which ones to avoid. Tax Network USA has proven strategies that are designed to settle your [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2360.9199999999996s)]
*  tax problems in your favor. Whether you owe $10,000 or $10 million, their attorneys and [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2366.3599999999997s)]
*  negotiators have resolved over $1 billion in tax debt. Talk with one of their strategists. It's [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2371.96s)]
*  free. Stop the threatening letters. Stop looking over your shoulders and put your IRS troubles [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2377.88s)]
*  behind you once and for all. Give them a call at 1-800-958-1000 or you can visit them online at [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2382.92s)]
*  tnusa.com slash smith. That's tnusa.com slash smith. All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2389.4s)]
*  I don't know. Any other thoughts on old Sam here? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2398.6800000000003s)]
*  That's well said at the end. He's reinserting himself as the authority. What would make for [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2402.36s)]
*  a better show? And it's like Rogan's doing the show he wants to do. People seem to like it. So [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2407.0800000000004s)]
*  I guess he doesn't really need your input on what would be better. And also Sam Harris had like a [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2412.6800000000003s)]
*  humongous podcast. He had a huge podcast many years before we had any audience. It's like, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2417.88s)]
*  so you could have done this, dude. Oh wait, you did do it and no one wanted to listen to it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2425.96s)]
*  All right, that's right. So you had your opportunity to do all by the way, when he goes, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2431.32s)]
*  when he goes, you know, Joe Rogan could pay them a million dollars a year. Yeah, so could you golden [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2436.6s)]
*  girls kid. Sure, you could pay him both a million dollars a year to Sam. Right. So go do it. So go [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2442.2000000000003s)]
*  do this wonderful podcast. And then again, it's like, it's like every, every, you know, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2448.92s)]
*  intellectual, it's the their kryptonite is always the market. It's always the market is always what [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2454.8399999999997s)]
*  fuck it. It's like, why don't you just go do that, man? You got the resources to go do that. Go spend [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2461.08s)]
*  some of your mom's money that she left you and pay two brilliant journalists a million dollars a [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2465.7999999999997s)]
*  year and go do your pocket. Oh, that's right. There's no market for that because no one believes [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2470.3599999999997s)]
*  your bullshit. And now we see the problem. So here, I'll just say this, and we'll, we'll wrap [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2474.44s)]
*  up fairly soon here. But so that the other the other one is the GAD video, GAD sad. What's I [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2482.84s)]
*  forget? What's his last name? So I will. Sounds right. No, I think it's pronounced GAD sad, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2490.6800000000003s)]
*  sod, maybe sod. So I you know, by the way, I don't know that much about him. But I will say I just [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2498.6800000000003s)]
*  thought this was pretty funny. So I saw, you know, because I just get, you know, when someone, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2506.84s)]
*  Sam Harris, or one of these guys does video about me, obviously, I get flooded with people tagging [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2513.08s)]
*  me in it and stuff. But so I did after the Sam Harris thing, you know, I laughed about that, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2517.0s)]
*  I texted some people, we all had a good laugh at Sam Harris's expense. And then I just saw that Elon [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2521.88s)]
*  posted this thing again. Now I happen to know, I don't know that much about him, but I know he's [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2531.32s)]
*  like a crazy pro Israel guy. And so I just assumed incorrectly so that when that he was jumping up [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2535.8s)]
*  piling on me too. And what I just saw it literally just the first, you know, second I saw that, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2543.5600000000004s)]
*  I just assumed he was making another video piling on me. And then I saw that Elon tweeted it and I [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2549.96s)]
*  was like, All right, here we go. We got a big one here. But then to my pleasant surprise, and I [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2555.0s)]
*  suppose in some perverse way a little bit to my disappointment, because that was just like, Oh, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2562.12s)]
*  this is an exciting day. But then I saw he made those videos, I should, I do think I should play [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2566.2799999999997s)]
*  let's play this real quick and then respond to them. We'll wrap up. Hi, everybody. This is [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2572.12s)]
*  Scott sad. I just saw a clip on X, where Sam Harris is sharing his profound disappointment that [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2579.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan would allow all sorts of people on his platform that quote, you know, spread this [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2589.8s)]
*  information and misinformation. He mentions a guy by the name of Dave Smith, I'm not exactly sure [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2599.8s)]
*  where he is. I know he's some kind of anti Israel guy. And then he mentions the fact that he speaks [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2605.4s)]
*  to guys like Tucker Carlson, and Donald Trump, and so on. And these guys are way too dangerous to be [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2611.7200000000003s)]
*  given this platform. Again, this demonstrates the consequentialist bent that Sam has when it comes [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2618.12s)]
*  to freedom of speech, freedom of inquiry, open debate in a free society. I may not like what Dave [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2629.96s)]
*  Smith says about Israel, and I may think that it's completely wrong. The few snippets I've seen, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2637.64s)]
*  I, you know, don't think very highly of his analyses. But I certainly have never had the [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2644.68s)]
*  reflex to go in public and say, Hey, Joe, why are you letting these guys on your show? Because I [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2651.7200000000003s)]
*  completely internalize the the ontological principle that in a free society, you speak to [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2660.36s)]
*  people. Now, you may choose not to want to speak to them because because you don't want to give them, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2667.32s)]
*  you know, your time. I don't necessarily debate creationists. Not because I'm trying to shut [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2672.68s)]
*  their voice, but because I don't think it'll be worthwhile exchange. All right, we could we could [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2681.0s)]
*  stop the video. I mean, I honestly think that pretty much kind of covers the point, you can [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2688.76s)]
*  kind of see where he's going with that. I will say I so I I appreciated that he's that Gad said that [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2694.28s)]
*  and I think like that's basically I think he's essentially right, you know, like, and I, I, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2701.96s)]
*  I would just, you know, I said something, by the way, I said something on Twitter, like just saying, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2709.2400000000002s)]
*  Hey, I appreciate him being principled. And then a bunch of people were like, jumping on me like, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2713.2400000000002s)]
*  he's a massage agent, and he's pro Israel, he supports genocide and all this. And you're like, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2718.04s)]
*  Okay, guys, like, I'm, I'm not speaking to the broadest scope of everything he's ever said or [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2721.96s)]
*  believed. I don't know that much about the guy just like he doesn't know that much about me. I [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2726.76s)]
*  don't know that much about him. I'm speaking to this. And I thought that this was a, like a noble [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2729.96s)]
*  gesture. And I appreciated it. And and I also, like, totally share this, this thought. And I do [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2737.0s)]
*  think that this is something that is like, and even if you want to argue, I understand people [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2745.96s)]
*  will have this kind of knee jerk reaction to go, well, Sam Harris isn't advocating for laws against, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2750.6s)]
*  you know, you going on on Rogan's podcast. So I understand where it's I'm not saying that he's [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2756.84s)]
*  advocating for my speech to be suppressed exactly, although he does seem to be flirting with that [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2761.2400000000002s)]
*  idea. You know, it's misinformation, it's dangerous, there should be fact checkers, they are soon seem [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2767.0s)]
*  to imply that Rogan shouldn't have me on at all. He's like, the only reason why people even know [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2773.56s)]
*  who this guy is, because Rogan has about but I do what I do really appreciate about GAD sentiment [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2777.6400000000003s)]
*  here is that, you know, I feel the same way. I mean, Rogan has had GAD on many times. He's had [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2785.32s)]
*  Sam Harris on many times, Ben Shapiro on, he's had he has Mike Baker on regularly, he has Coleman [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2794.6000000000004s)]
*  Hughes on, has I'm sure there's many more that I'm just not thinking of. But he's got a ton of guys [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2801.32s)]
*  who have really explicitly argued the pro-Israel side. And I've never even dreamed and part of this [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2808.76s)]
*  is just the power imbalance. You know what I mean? Like, we're just so up against the machine that [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2818.0400000000004s)]
*  we would never even think like, you should be silenced. You know what I mean? But I've never [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2822.36s)]
*  there's never been part of me that's been like, oh, you should have shut that down. You should [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2826.92s)]
*  have had an expert calling out misinformation. Hey, Joe, you didn't push back at this point or [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2831.88s)]
*  this point or this point. You know, my never even goes there. That's just like, if anything, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2836.52s)]
*  I'd be like, oh, I hope I can get back on and respond to that. You know, like I don't because [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2840.44s)]
*  unlike you know, there is like, I get GAD's point, there is something consequentialist about it. I [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2845.72s)]
*  get his point there. But forget the like deontological verse consequentialist thing. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2853.24s)]
*  There's a deep rooted insecurity in Sam Harris's position. Because if you actually were confident [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2858.36s)]
*  that I'm spreading misinformation, then wouldn't you just be like, dude, I can take this apart in a [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2866.12s)]
*  second? You know, when I like again, like we said, there's been so many times, so many people who [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2872.12s)]
*  listen to the show, you can't even count how many times we've thought someone's getting it all wrong. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2877.72s)]
*  And we're like, well, let's just grab our scalpels and carve this shit the fuck up. You know, because [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2882.3599999999997s)]
*  like, that's what you do when you think you're right. What you do when you're not comp when you're [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2887.48s)]
*  insecure about your own position is you start ranting about how this conversation shouldn't [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2891.48s)]
*  happen. misinformation, journalists, fact checkers come in here. So anyway, you know, I don't obviously [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2895.64s)]
*  mean me and GAD don't agree on the issue. You know, I did think whatever, I'm not going to give him [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2902.7599999999998s)]
*  any shit for this because he was ultimately making the correct point. There is just a little thing [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2910.3599999999997s)]
*  like where he goes like, I don't know that much about Dave, I've seen a few clips. And let's just [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2915.0s)]
*  say I don't have a lot of respect for his analysis. Like, okay, so like, help me out here, dude, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2919.24s)]
*  because I will tell you the truth. And I think this is something that that our audience knows [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2925.4s)]
*  about us. You know, it's one of the things that I'm most proud of. And I really do think that like, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2929.96s)]
*  our, our audience knows this to be the case. I'm trying to find the truth here. So if I'm [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2935.8s)]
*  getting something wrong, please let me know. So like, if you're gonna you know, like, you get my [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2942.12s)]
*  point, you're probably there's just like a little bit of a feeling where it's just like, hey, if [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2948.92s)]
*  you're gonna say this, if you're gonna just be like, listen, this guy gets everything wrong, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2951.88s)]
*  so okay, maybe, you know, like, give an example. What did I get wrong? What do you not agree with? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2955.4s)]
*  I think in this case, although also, I'm not familiar with Gads work, I don't know any of [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2963.48s)]
*  his other stuff. I think that just wasn't the point of this video. I think he was both saying, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2968.92s)]
*  Hey, I'm not endorsing what Dave's saying. I actually didn't agree with it, but everyone [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2973.16s)]
*  should be allowed free speech is more important. And so I guess it wasn't really, who knows, maybe [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2976.6s)]
*  I'll do another video delving into the weeds of what he thought you were getting wrong. That's [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2982.44s)]
*  just not really what he was doing here. Yeah, no, you're right. Yeah, you're right. I shouldn't I [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2985.64s)]
*  shouldn't beat him up for that because he is the point he's making here he is correct on and I do. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2990.2000000000003s)]
*  I do just I appreciate that and I should give him credit for that no matter what else [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=2997.2400000000002s)]
*  we may disagree on. We can we can agree on that. Yeah, like, it also is just like, look, free speech [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3002.04s)]
*  is a value in itself. And then on top of that, there is like, kind of, maybe this is the [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3009.16s)]
*  consequentialist argument for it, or just a more practical argument. But it's like, well, what else [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3018.68s)]
*  are we going to do here, dude? What are we gonna you know what I mean? What are we gonna all go [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3023.7999999999997s)]
*  to war with each other? Look, there's a huge split over many different issues. And so what like, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3029.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm over here saying, like, I'll pretty much, you know, it's been pretty clearly demonstrated [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3036.44s)]
*  over the last few years, like, I'll go on all the biggest platforms, and I'll do a ton of debates [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3042.2799999999997s)]
*  about these topics. And you're Sam sitting over here screaming misinformation. And it's like, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3047.88s)]
*  you know, like, so then why don't, wouldn't the thing be like, why wouldn't you then [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3054.2799999999997s)]
*  just want to debate? Like, why wouldn't you want to tear these arguments apart? Or even not like a [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3061.56s)]
*  debate, then just make your own thing, make your own video and list out all the grievances. Okay, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3067.48s)]
*  so anyway, you're right. I should give Gata pass for that. But but still, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3072.2799999999997s)]
*  give me something, give me something here to work with. All right, look, we got to, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3078.6s)]
*  we got to wrap on that. I do have to get moving. Okay, I'm out in Des Moines this weekend. I'm [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJwqR7RBmc&t=3082.44s)]
