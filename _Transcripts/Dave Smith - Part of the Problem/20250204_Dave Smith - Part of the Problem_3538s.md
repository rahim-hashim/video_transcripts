*  our return [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=109.2s)]
*  To Boston which is like one of my favorite places in the country to do stand-up and we haven't been there [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=110.84s)]
*  I believe was it 22 [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=116.16s)]
*  That we I think it was early in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=119.04s)]
*  2022 because if you remember our last show at Boston what a different world by the way [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=122.08s)]
*  Three years later our last show in Boston. We did a show the night before the vaccine [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=129.16s)]
*  Passports went into effect. Do you remember that Rob and it was just so [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=135.8s)]
*  It was so funny too for those of you guys, of course, I'm sure most of you remember but during the Cove it insanity [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  At this was at one point well after well after it was clear that the vaccine wasn't preventing you from getting COVID or transmitting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=147.08s)]
*  COVID they did this thing in major cities across the country where they said you can only come into a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=155.4s)]
*  Comedy club whether that was one of the places you could only come in if you showed proof of vaccination [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=161.76s)]
*  Which doesn't work too well for me and Rob's audience and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=167.76s)]
*  and we just [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=172.6s)]
*  You know, we weren't gonna play places that had that rule in effect. Like that just seemed I don't know just seemed so wrong [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=175.16s)]
*  you know what I mean, like I'm not gonna go somewhere where first off I [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=182.48s)]
*  Have to lie. I have to me and Rob have to lie in order to get in there or maybe there's some artist exception or something [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Like that but like regardless it's like then all my fellow purebloods are not allowed into the show that I'm doing that just doesn't seem [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  Right. It's everything I'm against. So I was like, well, I can't do that. I stopped even doing gigs at Fox News at the time [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=201.44s)]
*  I was like well fuck that dude. I like what am I gonna do? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=206.32s)]
*  You know, I remember during COVID when they first like reopened shit [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=210.12s)]
*  I would go into Fox News and I did Kennedy show live. I did great gut-filled show. I did a bunch of them [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=214.16s)]
*  And [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=219.89999999999998s)]
*  Because they were doing the rapid tests they'd make you sit there and get tested and then you could go in so I was like [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=220.82s)]
*  Whatever, I'll do that, you know, I don't care. But then once they were like you have to show proof of vaccination [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=226.42s)]
*  It was like wait, so now I got to show you my fake vaccine card and like I could do that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  But it just seemed to almost be and I don't know. I'm not really arguing like that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=238.5s)]
*  This is the case, but it felt I'm not saying like you're wrong if you went and did that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  I'm not but it felt to me like that was kind of like a tacit endorsement of it in some way or a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=248.1s)]
*  capitulation to it and I just wasn't willing to do that anyway [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=255.34s)]
*  the long of the short is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=259.06s)]
*  That was the last time we were in Boston. That's always one of our favorite cities to play [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=261.82s)]
*  So I'm really looking forward to getting back there and what a different I remember like it was such a weird thing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=266.6s)]
*  I mean that thinking about it now [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=272.26s)]
*  Especially just after the first few weeks of Trump's presidency and the vibe shift as it's being called in the country [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=274.62s)]
*  like the idea that I remember sitting there and being like [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=281.65999999999997s)]
*  That's it for like doing stand-up in all these major cities. Where the hell are we gonna go? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=286.02s)]
*  We're gonna have to you know what? I mean, like I the concern at the time was like they're never gonna [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=292.58s)]
*  They're never gonna stop doing this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=297.41999999999996s)]
*  This is just gonna be the policy from now on proof of vaccinate proof of updated boosters, you know forever luckily there was enough [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=299.5s)]
*  pushback that they ended up pulling the thing back, but now it's like I [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=307.86s)]
*  Don't know. It's just it's a very strange thing to think that like three years ago verse today [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=313.54s)]
*  You're we are living in a completely different country a completely different country than we were then and thank God [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=319.42s)]
*  Because that was not good [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=326.1s)]
*  Prosecute Fauci [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=328.42s)]
*  Prosecute Fauci. There we go. Okay. Anyway after Boston then we'll be I will be in Nashville [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm not sure if you're on that one with me Rob, but then Chicago [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=337.98s)]
*  Rosemont San Diego [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=341.98s)]
*  Appleton, Wisconsin Salt Lake City again, Denver, Cleveland Tacoma Spokane, Tampa [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=343.82000000000005s)]
*  Bunch of dates coming up comic Dave Smith comm for all of those dates [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=349.94s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=355.94s)]
*  Prosecuting fashion that always sounds like a good idea. It's pretty uh, it's pretty crazy [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=357.14s)]
*  But Elon Musk tweeted that out again something about prosecuting [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=361.96s)]
*  Fauci and it is wild [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=366.62s)]
*  Just to even think about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=369.78s)]
*  how much steam that idea is getting and obviously he's gotten a presidential pardon now from from Joe Biden, but [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=371.9s)]
*  You know, and I don't know Rob you tell me I'd imagine you probably agree with me on this [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=380.7s)]
*  But I will say that okay it like I'm old enough to remember that after [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=386.46s)]
*  When Barack Obama first got elected in 2008 and he assumed the presidency in January of 2009 [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  there were some left-wing activists who wanted to prosecute Bush and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=399.46s)]
*  You know top cabinet level people for the blatant war crimes that they had committed [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=405.78s)]
*  To there was enough pressure that Barack Obama had to give a speech about it and say he's not gonna do it [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=410.78000000000003s)]
*  It's one of my favorite things always I love mentioning when Obama goes up [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=417.98s)]
*  He goes I hear you know, I hear your concerns and yes, there were some crimes committed and we tortured some folks [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=421.98s)]
*  That was how he said it. We tortured some folks and then he goes but now is the time to look forward not backward [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=428.18s)]
*  And I remember always thinking like well, that's here's the thing about prosecuting crime [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=434.62s)]
*  You really have to look backward it's really the only way it works anyway, but that even then it was not [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=438.82s)]
*  It never felt like it was it was like a small enough contained group of left-wing activists who believed that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=447.82s)]
*  You know, I mean, I I completely agree with them [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=454.85999999999996s)]
*  But it wasn't that big when Donald Trump ran in 2016 and there were like the lock her up chance [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  That always felt to me like it was a novelty [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=464.22s)]
*  It was like a fun thing to put on a t-shirt [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=467.82000000000005s)]
*  But it never seemed like that like did you ever hear any of Trump's supporters? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=470.70000000000005s)]
*  You know being like man, he really didn't come through on that promise to prosecute Hillary Clinton like, you know [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=476.54s)]
*  What I mean, it just wasn't even taken as like a serious thing, but it does seem like today [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=481.02000000000004s)]
*  There is a palpable [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=486.38s)]
*  Very serious desire by a lot of Americans to prosecute some of the people who were you know what I mean guilty of these heinous crimes against humanity over the last few years [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=488.38s)]
*  And there's just something interesting about that and the fact that like that feeling was taken so seriously that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=500.54s)]
*  Whoever was making decisions for Joe Biden [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=509.18s)]
*  Decided he better issue these pardons that that in itself is just kind of wild [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=511.98s)]
*  I think um, you know, I was talking about this with Nicole after you hopped off yesterday, but I I do think that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=518.38s)]
*  so much of the um [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=524.78s)]
*  The hysteria that we're seeing right now from the establishment which again one of the most fascinating developments of the current [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=527.58s)]
*  Moment is that we're not seeing this level of hysteria from the the shock troops [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=537.1800000000001s)]
*  Like the young useful idiot leftist activists. We don't see a level of hysteria from them like we did in 2017 [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=544.62s)]
*  But the hysteria that we are seeing from the corporate media and from the senate and things like this [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=552.5400000000001s)]
*  You know when it's when it's about tulsi gabard or jim jim jim [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=559.9000000000001s)]
*  You know when it's when it's about tulsi gabard or it's about bobby kennedy or it's about this, uh, the usaid stuff [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=564.14s)]
*  or any of that [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=571.18s)]
*  it's like the dynamic here [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=572.62s)]
*  is that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=576.06s)]
*  It's it's not just that like oh no in outsiders coming in and they may get the policies that they want [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=577.82s)]
*  Rather than the policies that we want there's something much deeper than that and it's I I think it's much more like oh shit [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=585.26s)]
*  Serious crimes have been committed [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=593.34s)]
*  And if these outsiders come in and have access to these books [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=596.3s)]

*  Like I don't think it's a coincidence that there's a freak out over like hey [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=641.18s)]
*  You know what? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=646.22s)]
*  I mean like these people might have access to all the crimes that were committed by the deep state all the crimes that were [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=646.62s)]
*  Committed by the the health institutions and they also have the justice department [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=651.98s)]
*  like they also have somewhere that they could send these complaints to and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=657.82s)]
*  You know [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=662.0600000000001s)]
*  It's just an interesting dynamic. Like it's it's hard to say exactly where all of this goes [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=663.66s)]
*  um, or if even if trump really has the political will to go through with some stuff like that, but [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=669.98s)]
*  It certainly is interesting to watch the freak out about all of that because like the the truth is that the level of crimes that have been [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=677.02s)]
*  Committed are so heinous that if they were to be exposed [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=684.78s)]
*  I mean look when you think about even just what already has come out, right? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=689.9799999999999s)]
*  I mean this this thing which by the way was news to me [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=694.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you had heard of this rob, but like I I knew that like [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=697.26s)]
*  The um nih subsidiaries had had funded the wuhan lab. I didn't know that usaid had [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=701.8199999999999s)]
*  Um, but even just think about that. You're like, oh look at it. We made covet [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=709.1s)]
*  Our government made coveted [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=714.54s)]
*  This is like the biggest freaking scandal in the world [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=716.9399999999999s)]
*  Like this this virus that not only you think about the fact that it's not only the virus itself [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=720.3s)]
*  Which you know, obviously the people who died of covet were sick and old people 99.9 percent of the time [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=727.74s)]
*  But still I mean, you know, that's a lot of people died of this thing and got you know [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=735.74s)]
*  In many cases, maybe it only robbed a year of their life or two years of their life [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=740.14s)]
*  But dude, that's a big deal to rob somebody of the last two years of their lives [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=744.38s)]
*  But it's not so it's not just the virus that killed millions of people worldwide [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=749.1s)]
*  But then it's also all of the cost of the government [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=753.82s)]
*  Response to the virus which was also done by the government [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=758.3000000000001s)]
*  So like they made the virus and then locked down in response to it. They just the amount [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=761.5s)]
*  Of human suffering that they caused because they wanted to have these, you know, I don't know [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=767.9000000000001s)]
*  Is it too far to classify it as bio weapons? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=774.38s)]
*  I mean whatever the hell you want to call it they decided they wanted to do this gain of function research in a in a [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=776.7800000000001s)]
*  Shoddy chinese lab with like substandard, you know like [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=783.88s)]
*  protocols [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=789.08s)]
*  They decided that they wanted to do this and then just did this to the entire world [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=790.22s)]
*  I mean, how do you look at that and not go like wait? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=794.7800000000001s)]
*  You're telling me if I bring my gun that I legally own [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=797.34s)]
*  In my car and drive to philly I could be arrested and be looking at 10 years in prison [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=802.86s)]
*  But no one should go to prison for that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=810.3000000000001s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? Like how could you possibly believe both of those things? It's just you know, it's pretty wild [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=813.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's also pretty telling with uh with the fact that they were involved in the creation of the virus [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=821.02s)]
*  Uh that there's a freak out over the agency being absorbed by anyone else [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=827.42s)]
*  It really seems like people that uh had their hands in that pie and that payment processing are a little bit concerned that they [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=831.9s)]
*  Just lost a piece of pie [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=839.02s)]
*  Well, it's amazing too because it's it kind of demonstrates in a way [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=841.02s)]
*  Like the mentality that so many of these people have where like so you have um, you know for in the backdrop you have [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=845.5799999999999s)]
*  All of these people shrieking about democracy [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=853.66s)]
*  For the last four years [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=857.66s)]
*  um, you know January [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=859.66s)]
*  January 6th and donald trump election denier and this is the democracies on the ballot says the former president of the united states of america before [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=861.8199999999999s)]
*  Having tea with adolf hitler. Uh there you know, this is the end of democracy if donald trump wins [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=871.02s)]
*  And then you have the you know, so there's this hyperbole this insane hyperbole [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=876.6999999999999s)]
*  And then you have the reality of the situation which is like hey donald trump comes in and you know, he's running on hey [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=882.06s)]
*  We're gonna go over like the entire federal budget [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=887.5799999999999s)]
*  We're gonna look at the whole thing and see where there's waste and i'm putting this elon musk guy in charge of this new [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=890.3s)]
*  You know imaginary department where he's gonna go over all of this stuff [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=896.14s)]
*  And then like elon musk's like, okay, let's take a look at this us aid, you know thing and then their attitude is like, excuse me [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=900.0600000000001s)]
*  Sorry [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=910.0600000000001s)]
*  Unelected bureaucrats over here. Who the hell are you to tell us about our budget? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=911.16s)]
*  You're like well, he was picked by the guy who was just democratically elected like that's [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=916.62s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=921.98s)]
*  Nobody at us aid was elected by the people, you know what I mean? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=923.1800000000001s)]
*  And it's like you just see this dynamic where you're like wait [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=926.94s)]
*  I thought you guys were so concerned with democracy and yet the way this thing actually works [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=929.42s)]
*  Is that you're completely outside of any democratic force and you're just this permanent governing structure [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=933.82s)]
*  And you're supposed to just be able to do what you want to do and then fund things like like think about [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=941.26s)]
*  Think about how crazy it is that we're just finding out that they were funding the lab [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=947.5s)]
*  Like this is this is the most major story over the last five years [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=950.54s)]
*  And the american people have no way of even knowing this like how can you believe in democracy? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=954.46s)]
*  without [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=959.8199999999999s)]
*  Some degree of the most basic degree of transparency, right? Because if you could hide [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=960.78s)]
*  the biggest [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=966.3s)]
*  Story in the last five years by far. There's nothing even compares to what covet was [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=967.66s)]
*  This is the biggest thing that happened to this country in the last five years [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=973.1s)]
*  And if you're telling me that you could hide that our government was funding the the creation of the thing [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=976.14s)]
*  How is a voter supposed to make an informed decision if they're not even allowed to know the biggest fucking thing [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=983.1800000000001s)]
*  Which by the way rob I don't you know explain to me what their rationale could possibly be [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=989.5s)]
*  Is that a national security threat that we know this? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=994.7s)]
*  Are there sources and methods that were compromised by us knowing where the usaid budget was allocating money? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=997.9000000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. It just makes them look really bad [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1005.26s)]
*  That's it [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1008.7s)]
*  there, uh, I do think that there is uh, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1009.82s)]
*  I'm neutral on elon musk. He clearly did us a big favor with twitter and uh restored free speech to the internet [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1012.86s)]
*  Uh, so and you know, you think what's the problem you think the cars are gay? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1018.7800000000001s)]
*  I know but I do think he's a defense contractor and he's made some of his wealth off of uh, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1023.4200000000001s)]
*  Favorable government contracts and being in on credit schemes. So I don't think he's an entirely, uh neutral or good force [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1028.8600000000001s)]
*  Uh, and there is something odd about you know, a billionaire who still has his own private businesses [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1037.1799999999998s)]
*  Um having access to government data to me making decisions now [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1043.26s)]
*  You could say if he's just acting as a hatchet man [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1047.58s)]
*  Then there is no conflict of interest and he's actually working as a force for good [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1050.62s)]
*  Uh, the big claims was that he had access [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1055.58s)]
*  It's always funny when they tell you that there's a massive threat, but they won't tell you what it is [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1058.06s)]
*  It's kind of project 2025 the boogeyman of project 2025 project 25 project 25 [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1061.98s)]
*  Well, what exactly is the threat of project 2025? No one articulated it [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1067.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean how many news stories were there? Oh my god [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1070.78s)]
*  If donald trump comes in project 2025 will be enacted and then what what is the bad thing or project 2025? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1072.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm supposed to fear and so in this case, they're screaming about the data breach of elon musk having access to this information [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1078.8600000000001s)]
*  and [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1086.0600000000002s)]
*  Explains me. What is the issue is that that now he's gonna incorporate that into x he's gonna have user data [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1086.7s)]
*  Like if there's a data breach i'm all for hey, I don't like you know people having my data [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1092.7s)]
*  I try and can to the extent that I can opt out of collecting my data [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1097.5800000000002s)]
*  I do but can someone if it's that he just has [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1101.9s)]
*  19 year olds taxpayer records they're all trying to make like paint it like it was some sort of like [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1105.8s)]
*  Not quite a pedophilia thing but like he's endangering our kids if he can see 19 year olds tax returns and it's like [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1109.82s)]
*  Well, can you explain can you explain to me what the risk of that is? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1115.98s)]
*  Where's the data breach here if he's just looking at the information to actually axe people? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1118.86s)]
*  What is what's the threat here? What is the data breach and i've yet to hear it articulated? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1123.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1129.02s)]
*  I I really agree with everything I cosine that entirely [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1130.22s)]
*  um, I think that in a lot of ways what it comes down to for us [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1134.22s)]
*  Is almost like the way i'm looking at it is almost like, uh, I know i'm sorry i'm going into a metaphor [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1139.74s)]
*  That's all I that's all i'm really good. I like your metaphors [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1146.54s)]
*  Well, I try i'd like to do them because they you know [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1149.66s)]
*  It's a good way to you know stretch your brain and like feel like how how to think about these things [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1151.82s)]
*  But i'm looking at trump and elon musk and all these guys more and more [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1156.54s)]
*  like if someone's breaking into your house and you just look and it's like they're about to bust through the door and you [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1160.46s)]
*  Look around and you know, whatever you grab something you grab a uh, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1167.18s)]
*  Kitchen knife or a frying pan or something, you know something he uses a weapon and then somebody could be like, you know [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1171.66s)]
*  That's really not the ideal weapon. The ideal weapon is like this thing that you don't have [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1177.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, the ideal weapon is an ar-15, but you don't have one and you're like, yeah [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1181.98s)]
*  Okay [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1186.6200000000001s)]
*  It may not be the ideal weapon. It seems to be a weapon [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1187.98s)]
*  And that's better than nothing and I think that with a lot of this stuff with the the trump administration [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1192.22s)]
*  We're going to get into some more specifics on this but it's like, okay [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1197.9s)]
*  There is at least some positive motion in some areas and that is [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1201.58s)]
*  So much better than what we've had for quite a while including trump's first term, you know [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1207.74s)]
*  Including his first four years [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1213.26s)]
*  um, and in some ways it does seem I know this is early in the administration to to [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1215.26s)]
*  Say something like this, but it does seem to me that it's like, okay [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1220.14s)]
*  Trump maybe needed those first four years to figure this shit out [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1224.78s)]
*  He may he may have needed those years and then he may have needed to be that burned by the system in the four years [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1229.1000000000001s)]
*  He was out to to come in now with at least a little bit of a game plan [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1234.6200000000001s)]
*  A little bit of a sense of how to wield this power of the presidency again [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1239.5800000000002s)]
*  Still big question marks. The guy's only been president for you know, uh, what is it? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1243.98s)]
*  Three weeks or something like that. So, okay, let's not [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1249.4199999999998s)]
*  Make you know jump to conclusions here, but it does seem like um [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1254.06s)]
*  It just seems like it's a different trump in a lot of ways this time [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1260.06s)]
*  And it's also incredible that if you just desire to clean up some of the mess [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1263.26s)]
*  How easy some of the messes to clean up? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1268.1399999999999s)]
*  So the fact that some criminals are actually being sent out of the country [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1270.3s)]
*  That's common sense or the fact there was some guy who's making a 10 million dollar salary year like in kentucky on uh, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1274.7800000000002s)]
*  Like farm construction equipment or something and he just got fired [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1281.5800000000002s)]
*  Elon musk came back that the people that process payments in the treasury have never declined a payment ever [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1285.5800000000002s)]
*  uh, or in this case the fact that uh, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1291.5800000000002s)]
*  That this organization was responsible for sending money over to wuhan [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1294.14s)]
*  We never heard about that and I can only imagine how much fraud and abuse is in the usa aid [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1298.46s)]
*  I can only imagine so I mean we're only a week in and it's not again [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1303.02s)]
*  You know the the issue with the usa id is not even that it's um, it's not so much that it's there's there's fraud or [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1307.26s)]
*  An abuse it's not like there's like oh, there's this waste [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1315.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? And that's the thing about the usaid is that [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1317.8999999999999s)]
*  It's the cia front [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1321.9799999999998s)]
*  It's like that's the whole game funds [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1324.9399999999998s)]
*  Yes, that's it's the whole game. It's for it's for development. You know what I mean? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1327.34s)]
*  It's like the national endowment for democracy, right? We're just democracy promoting aka [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1331.9s)]
*  Overthrowing regimes that we don't like and the usaid I know they were big [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1339.72s)]
*  You know like the the thing I know about them the most is that they were the ones who pumped five billion dollars into ukraine between [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1344.38s)]
*  1991 and 2014 [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1351.0s)]
*  They were pumping in and what were they doing with the money that they were pumping in there? Well, they're establishing [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1353.42s)]
*  Independent media, that's what they call it [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1359.64s)]
*  Independent media, right and helping these ngo's and all this shit the same organs that ended up fomenting [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1363.32s)]
*  the the madon revolution and so it's like it which by the way overthrew a [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1370.78s)]
*  democratically elected government didn't stop the national endowment for democracy from pouring money into that protest that the that yanukovych was [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1376.3600000000001s)]
*  democratically elected as I've bet you many times by the way elections verified by the eu and it's so it's not as if it's not [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1384.2800000000002s)]
*  Even like the west is claiming that the elections weren't legitimate. You know what I mean? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1390.38s)]
*  Like it's just that's the way this game works. And so what they do constantly, you know [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1394.7800000000002s)]
*  Mike benz was just talking about this the other day or he was like there's nothing that the usaid does that isn't a cia [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1399.98s)]
*  Up like even if they're just doing something that might seem kind of like aid like oh [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1407.74s)]
*  They're just helping to irrigate these crops in this country somewhere [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1413.98s)]
*  It's like yeah [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1418.22s)]
*  Because we want other resources that they have what what it is. They have a 50 billion dollar budget [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1419.42s)]
*  I believe double check me on that number but really is a 50 billion dollar budget that the usaid has and [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1425.74s)]
*  They're just in the game of empire. That's what it's about [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1432.14s)]
*  It's not about this idea of like oh helping people here and there like that's all bullshit [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1436.38s)]
*  It's about controlling the world. There's always strings attached [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1440.8600000000001s)]
*  There's always a goal in mind and it's never you know, like I mean like it really doesn't take too much [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1445.18s)]
*  to to notice this stuff, but you know [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1451.26s)]
*  when you're let's say when you're as [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1455.0200000000002s)]
*  deeply connected with say [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1458.3600000000001s)]
*  saudi arabia [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1462.1200000000001s)]
*  and israel [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1463.74s)]
*  Don't tell me you're overthrowing some other government over human rights abuses. It's a fuck out of here [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1465.98s)]
*  Are you you know what i'm saying? Like don't tell me you were overthrowing [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1472.46s)]
*  Momar kaddafi because you were very concerned about the human rights abuses and that's why we support [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1476.22s)]
*  The israeli war cabinet and the house of sod like get out of here. This is too ridiculous [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1482.46s)]
*  It's like how stupid would you have to be to not see through that immediately? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1488.54s)]
*  You know, oh that's our you know our real problem [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1493.02s)]
*  With uh, this is why we had to overthrow [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1496.62s)]
*  milosevic [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1499.6399999999999s)]
*  Because he was ethnically cleansing people [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1500.86s)]
*  Yet we have to support israel in their effort to ethnically cleanse people. Come on [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1504.3s)]
*  Well, i'm gonna venture to say I don't think the real issue there is ethnic cleansing [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1509.18s)]
*  I think it's something else [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1514.62s)]
*  Right, like I think it's about oh. Oh milosevic was aligned with russia. Okay [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1516.46s)]
*  Now it's making a little bit more sense. So this isn't about democracy promotion. It's not about human rights [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1523.1s)]
*  It's about empire. It's about ruling the world [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1529.5s)]
*  This is you know, like it's it's like in the same way that every company wants to make more money [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1533.74s)]
*  Every company wants to expand every government wants to expand every government wants to get bigger and bigger [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1540.54s)]
*  And america is the most powerful government in the history of the world and that's not enough for them [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1546.78s)]
*  They would like more [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1551.8200000000002s)]
*  That's all that it's about so the real [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1553.74s)]
*  Freak out is that that could be revealed [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1556.6200000000001s)]
*  And then people have a whole different look [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1559.98s)]
*  This is the the the essence of why the kennedy files have been sealed for this long [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1562.0600000000002s)]
*  and by the way [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1567.02s)]
*  I should get ahead of this on record because i've just I you know, because when this comes out [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1567.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm sure there'll be people who look back and go like ah see there was nothing to it [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1574.14s)]
*  I don't think anything's going to be major is going to be revealed by these declassified documents [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1578.38s)]
*  I know I don't believe that like they got enough time to clean them up [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1582.46s)]
*  After holding them for 40 years the fact that they can't just be brought out of their file and released [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1586.3000000000002s)]
*  Yes, the president says they need to be released is insane [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1591.5800000000002s)]
*  right, but listen for anybody out there that [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1594.6200000000001s)]
*  It's not like there's a document out there going the cia killed kennedy [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1598.0600000000002s)]
*  And then they just left this document in there for all these decades [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1602.5400000000002s)]
*  And then they're like we sure do hope a president never gets elected who decides to declassify these things [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1606.06s)]
*  but the reason why there's been so much secrecy over the kennedy assassination is like [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1611.5s)]
*  And look, I mean there's people who have done much deeper dives on this than me [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1618.94s)]
*  And it's but aside from world war two [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1623.18s)]
*  There's probably been more books and more research done on the kennedy assassination than like any other topic [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1625.82s)]
*  But all you have to do is know some very basic things about it and it's so obviously a cover-up [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1632.38s)]
*  It's just so ridiculously obvious like if you just know like a few key pieces of information [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1637.98s)]
*  like you know that like [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1644.3000000000002s)]
*  Okay, like dude, I mean first off just looking at it on paper. How the hell anybody believe the story where you go [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1646.3000000000002s)]
*  It was a lone gunman [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1651.74s)]
*  Who then happened to be assassinated by another lone gunman? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1654.46s)]
*  I mean, that's insane. And then oh by the way, the first lone gunman was also working for the cia [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1657.02s)]
*  Don't let that fuck with you too much. Don't like don't even overthink that he also by the way at the height of the cold war [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1662.86s)]
*  Just went and popped into russia for a little bit and then popped back here like it's just and then [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1669.34s)]
*  You know if you just know that uh jack kennedy had fired the head of the cia [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1675.58s)]
*  Shortly before his assassination and that that fired head of the cia [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1681.34s)]
*  Was put on the warren commission to investigate what happened in his assassination. I mean, I think I think [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1687.58s)]
*  Just having those points down would be like, okay. My working assumption now is this is a conspiracy [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1694.3799999999999s)]
*  Like like now the onus is on you to prove it [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1701.8999999999999s)]
*  That this wasn't a conspiracy [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1704.3799999999999s)]
*  But the reason why this has to has to be kept secret for all of these years isn't because um, anyone's like protecting their own ass [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1706.3799999999999s)]
*  Nobody's alive anymore. I mean and if they are they're ancient, you know what I mean? Um, it it's because [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1711.98s)]
*  Like the similar thing I was saying with the usaid it's because like if you figured that out [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1720.62s)]
*  You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1725.58s)]
*  It's because [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1728.22s)]
*  Like the similar thing I was saying with the usaid it's because like if you figure that out [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1730.46s)]
*  That's just such a juicy secret that you can't let the american people all know that because once you know [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1735.1000000000001s)]
*  that the cia [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1742.0600000000002s)]
*  Murdered the sitting president of the united states of america. Well, then this whole country isn't what you thought it was anymore [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1744.22s)]
*  That's the only next conclusion. You're like, oh [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1752.14s)]
*  And every normie out there is like, oh, okay. Well now I have to totally reevaluate what I what I think about everything [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1754.8600000000001s)]
*  um, and then [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1762.22s)]
*  One of the next logical questions might be like hey, so what year did it stop being like that? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1764.46s)]
*  You know, and then you realize pretty quickly. Oh [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1770.7800000000002s)]
*  that is [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1774.14s)]
*  Some year in the future maybe but that year has not come yet [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1775.5800000000002s)]
*  Um [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1778.94s)]
*  So anyway, that is it's just very very very interesting time for people like us who have cared about these issues for quite a long [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1779.82s)]
*  while and kind of uh, just a lot of the things that are happening right now and again, i'm not trying to oversell it, you know [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1786.22s)]
*  there's there's bad that comes with donald trump and I he I [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1792.3799999999999s)]
*  Guarantee he's going to disappoint at some point in the next four years [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1797.3999999999999s)]
*  Probably at multiple points and i'm not at all claiming that like the establishment has been overthrown [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1801.98s)]
*  Or that permanent washington isn't still running the show [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1808.22s)]
*  But there are so many of these things [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1811.74s)]
*  just [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1815.26s)]
*  Seemed impossible [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1816.7s)]
*  Not very long ago [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1818.7800000000002s)]
*  like it just seemed like so much of this was never going to happen and so much of it is happening now and that's that's very encouraging and [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1820.38s)]

*  Part of the problem. All right, let's get back into the show [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1899.76s)]
*  Um, I should okay a couple things that we should address actually i'm just going to real quickly [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1903.44s)]
*  Double check the news on this. Um, but it bobby kennedy did pass [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1910.8s)]
*  um [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1916.64s)]
*  Uh the senate committee vote [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1917.92s)]
*  Um, so he he passed the senate senate committee, uh, i'm the the finance committee [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1920.72s)]
*  vote so he was confirmed by them and now I guess it kicks it over to a uh, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1927.1200000000001s)]
*  To the senate vote so that should be in later today from the reports that i'm seeing [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1932.48s)]
*  Uh, it's it's looking like he's going to be confirmed by a very small margin [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1938.8s)]
*  Uh, you never know until the time comes you never know [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1944.16s)]
*  What you know when you're dealing with these small margins? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1948.0s)]
*  All you need is a couple of senators to kind of do the wrong thing. Um, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1951.6s)]
*  Tulsi is in a similar situation. I'm hearing that she's probably going to be confirmed [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1956.32s)]
*  But that it's a razor thin margin and again, these are like, you know, if you remember john mccain famously [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1960.56s)]
*  Uh voting down the repeal of obamacare [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1966.72s)]
*  all it takes [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1970.32s)]
*  Is like one or two of the republican senators to fall in line and just go no [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1971.9199999999998s)]
*  We're not going to do this. I'm not counting any chickens before they're hatched on this one, but [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1978.08s)]
*  That's the latest of where we are and you know for the for the rest of the show [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1984.24s)]
*  Well, i'll check a couple more times and let you know if there's an update there [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1988.08s)]
*  um, okay, let's uh [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1992.08s)]
*  Let's see what uh, what should we go to next year because I had a few [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=1995.2s)]
*  So i'm just kind of debating on which one what did we have here we had the um, this is okay [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2000.88s)]
*  Let's go to the elizabeth warren video because that's on the topic of bobby kennedy. Um, and I believe this was her [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2004.88s)]
*  reacting to him [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2011.9s)]
*  um [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2014.16s)]
*  Passing the senate finance committee [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2015.68s)]
*  um [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2018.32s)]
*  So so this is elizabeth warren [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2020.0s)]
*  Reacting to bobby kennedy passing the initial senate finance committee, uh vote here she is [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2022.3s)]
*  Stated this is not only about a private company that gets sued and has to pay out [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2030.08s)]
*  vaccine manufacturers [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2036.86s)]
*  Often operate on very slim profit margins if they get sued [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2038.88s)]
*  repeatedly and successfully [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2045.18s)]
*  They simply move out of the vaccine space we've already seen this happen with vaccines in the past [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2047.98s)]
*  20 years ago. We watched vaccines just move away if they did not have protection from these kinds of lawsuits [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2055.98s)]
*  The consequence of mr. Kennedy's ability to make those lawsuits easier [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2064.62s)]
*  Is also the ability to shut down access and manufacturing for vaccines for every one of us and I think that's a [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2070.62s)]
*  stated [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2079.48s)]
*  All right [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2081.2599999999998s)]
*  Now rob, I gotta say this comes off as a little dishonest to me [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2082.7s)]
*  and I just [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2087.98s)]
*  I'm shocked to see dishonesty out of elizabeth warren. It's really a betrayal of her native american heritage [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2089.58s)]
*  um [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2097.1s)]
*  This is um [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2098.46s)]
*  You know, they're very honest people they pride themselves. Uh, their word is their bond. Um [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2100.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, rob, I don't know dude you ever take a moment to think about [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2105.82s)]
*  How tough it is out for these pharmaceutical companies? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2109.6600000000003s)]
*  you know big pharma's operating on razor thin profit motor like [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2113.34s)]
*  uh, you know [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2117.9s)]
*  Isn't it wild? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2119.82s)]
*  This is [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2121.9s)]
*  a defense [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2122.94s)]
*  of a [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2124.86s)]
*  This is elizabeth warren we're talking about and the issue we're talking about is giant corporations [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2126.7000000000003s)]
*  Being able to be sued for injuring people [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2133.5800000000004s)]
*  and elizabeth warren [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2137.5s)]
*  Is on the side of the giant corporations and is making the argument that like there's um [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2140.0600000000004s)]
*  You know the the person who always wants the wealthy to pay their fair share and is always concerned about big money or whatever [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2147.6600000000003s)]
*  She's making the argument that this could disincentivize them from further production [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2154.94s)]
*  and therefore we can't have the threat of lawsuits like [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2161.66s)]
*  What is it? It's just wild. Nothing exposes how phony people are than when they totally go against their own [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2165.9s)]
*  stated worldview [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2175.1s)]
*  Just because they don't well, I don't know [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2177.58s)]
*  I mean it seems like trying to protect these big companies, but again, I mean, I don't know rob [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2181.42s)]
*  I don't know what you think about this, but I just kind of go like, okay [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2186.14s)]
*  Well, like what's the arc if you're making the argument that the lawsuits are frivolous or that like they weren't really injured [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2190.46s)]
*  Well, then the argument would be to tighten up the legal system and be like yeah [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2197.18s)]
*  You shouldn't be able to sue a company if they haven't actually caused any harm. That is kind of already the case [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2200.62s)]
*  It's pretty hard to sue a giant company like like really think about this right you're a vaccine injured person [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2206.2999999999997s)]
*  you're trying to take on like [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2212.38s)]
*  Pfizer [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2214.94s)]
*  you know [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2216.2999999999997s)]
*  Probably they got a few more bucks to throw at lawyers than you do [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2218.22s)]
*  And it's kind of it's already pretty difficult to prove vaccine injuries [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2221.74s)]
*  That's one of the messed up things about vaccine injuries is that it's very easy to say like hey, you know [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2225.58s)]
*  This happened to you, but how can you prove that it was from the vaccine could have been from something else? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2232.46s)]
*  And I know a lot of people I know several people very well [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2237.02s)]
*  who have had like [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2242.3s)]
*  heart issues [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2244.62s)]
*  since covid and [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2245.98s)]
*  You know the suspicion is that like yeah [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2248.54s)]
*  I mean, I don't know this person got double vaccinated and then took two boosters and all of a sudden, you know [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2251.26s)]
*  A 44 year old perfectly healthy person is having heart issues [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2257.5s)]
*  That seems to me like but I can't prove that that's what it was [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2261.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like I saw that person eat a lot of chicken nuggets that weekend [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2264.86s)]
*  Yeah, right. Right. So who knows for sure, but it does seem like a likely culprit, but [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2268.7s)]
*  it [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2273.98s)]
*  If the argument here really is right that [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2274.94s)]
*  They well listen [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2278.54s)]
*  If you had to pay out every time these vaccines injured somebody [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2280.54s)]
*  Then it wouldn't be profitable enough to make the vaccines. I don't think that's the winning argument you think it is [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2284.54s)]
*  because that would kind of [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2291.5s)]
*  Suggest that like the vaccines may not be worth it [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2293.34s)]
*  Right, like isn't that the lot isn't that the information that you would get from this economic reality? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2297.26s)]
*  That it's like this is a math equation [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2304.06s)]
*  If you're telling me that having to compensate people for all of the harm that this product causes [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2306.2200000000003s)]
*  Would then make it not worth it to produce this product then that is the economy telling you [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2311.8999999999996s)]
*  It's not worth it to produce this product [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2318.14s)]
*  Kind of like if college is so expensive that you can never pay off the loans [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2321.2599999999998s)]
*  That kind of lets you know that college isn't worth it at that price [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2325.58s)]
*  Right. Am I missing something rob? What do you think? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2329.2599999999998s)]
*  uh, well [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2332.8599999999997s)]
*  I got a hot take which is uh, and you guys can check out tomorrow's on your mouth because i'm going to play this clip [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2335.42s)]
*  But I happen to agree with elizabeth warren that uh rfk junior should have to divest his financial stake in these lawsuits [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2339.18s)]
*  um [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2346.7799999999997s)]
*  And uh, but I believe I believe he said he would well he's passing it on to his son [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2347.66s)]
*  And the problem with that is that it's not a true divestment [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2353.3399999999997s)]
*  But on the other side of it [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2357.66s)]
*  I don't know that you can really hold politicians to the standard that your own relatives can't possibly be profiting from [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2359.5s)]
*  any of the auxiliary [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2365.66s)]
*  Things of what you do because i'm sure that there's not a single senator congressman [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2367.8199999999997s)]
*  Who doesn't have a kid in some sort of an agency that you know it you know, I it's uh, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2373.2599999999998s)]
*  That's a tough standard but speaking more specifically to the clip that you just played and i've broken this down before on the show [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2378.3799999999997s)]
*  um that removing vaccine liability [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2385.3399999999997s)]
*  Removes the market mechanisms to figure out whether or not these products are safe. Yeah, and so it just doesn't make sense [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2389.1s)]
*  Specifically because if they did not have those protections it would be absorbed in the cost of the vaccines [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2396.68s)]
*  And then people who are if it if it serves the greater good that everyone needs to be vaccinated [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2402.86s)]
*  So then there's no reason why we wouldn't pay into a fund where the people that are injured by them get paid out [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2407.18s)]
*  And the easiest way to collect those funds is let's say there's a vaccine and i'm going to give it to 100 million people [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2412.2999999999997s)]
*  And one of the 100 million people is going to lose their life [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2417.9s)]
*  Well, then great instead of charging a dollar charge two dollars now you can pay out 100 million dollars to that family [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2421.58s)]
*  Or you can change up the math you can decide what that value is [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2427.1000000000004s)]
*  but the point i'm just saying is it's actually very easy to [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2429.9s)]
*  Compensate the people that will be vaccine injured and then it also creates a market mechanism by which if a vaccine is not [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2433.6400000000003s)]
*  Overwhelmingly good then it's not worth producing [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2441.96s)]
*  Like can you please explain to me why their product is so good? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2445.1000000000004s)]
*  But it can only exist on the market if they can't be held accountable for when it doesn't work the way that it's supposed to [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2449.42s)]
*  Then how can the product be that like or why are their margins that thin? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2456.94s)]
*  Why if their product is so good and everybody needs it? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2461.98s)]
*  Why does it have such thin profit margins? I thought that this is a usually revolutionary technologies have room for profit [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2465.18s)]
*  Is it other legislation that the government created that they can't make the profit that they need to do like [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2472.62s)]
*  And so now you got to overcompensate for that distortion by not giving them liability and is that better? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2478.14s)]
*  Is that a better system? So think about the claim. I mean, yeah, imagine imagine I was selling computers [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2483.18s)]
*  And I I started with the claim that I was like listen rob. This is a perfect computer [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2489.8199999999997s)]
*  It's never going to blow up and and kill you [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2495.98s)]
*  um, I do need [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2499.42s)]
*  to uh enshrine in the law that I cannot be sued if this blows up and kills you though [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2501.66s)]
*  You know what? I mean like it's it's like wait a minute. Hold on first. Your claim is that this isn't happening [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2507.2599999999998s)]
*  Then your claim is that well and and then I go oh and by the way if I don't have liability protection over that [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2512.7799999999997s)]
*  Then it wouldn't even be worth it for me. I wouldn't even be able to sell this computer to you. Like come on [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2518.14s)]
*  Yeah, can't you see through this? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2523.02s)]
*  And then uh, there was also a good stat of uh, which give me a second I can uh, I can pull this up [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2526.62s)]
*  But elizabeth warren I think is in [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2532.06s)]
*  The top 10 senate list of who receives money from pharmaceutical companies here. I can give you the exact number right here [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2534.86s)]
*  Uh, she comes in third at 1.2 million dollars [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2541.58s)]
*  There you go [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2546.86s)]
*  Well, i'm sure that has nothing to do with her position on this whatsoever [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2547.98s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is tax network usa [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2553.42s)]

*  Getting ahead of this is the smart move but never never contact the irs alone [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2575.1s)]
*  Turn it over to the team at tax network usa because not all tax resolution companies are the same [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2580.54s)]
*  Tax network usa has a preferred direct line to the irs [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2586.3s)]
*  This means that they know which agents to deal with and which ones to avoid [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2590.62s)]
*  Tax network usa has proven strategies that are designed to settle your tax problems in your favor [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2594.86s)]

*  Talk with one of their strategists. It's free [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2608.78s)]
*  Stop the threatening letters stop looking over your shoulder and put your irs troubles behind you once and for all call them at [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2611.5s)]
*  1-800-958-1000 or visit tn usa.com [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2619.7999999999997s)]
*  Smith that's tn usa.com [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2624.94s)]
*  Slash smith. All right, let's get back into the show [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2628.14s)]
*  um [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2631.1s)]
*  All right. The other thing that I do have to uh, we got to at least mention quickly [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2632.46s)]
*  Is that uh at least a closing according to a disclose dot tv [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2637.5s)]
*  um [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2642.3s)]
*  And this is as of two hours ago [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2643.5s)]
*  Uh, the white house is preparing an executive order to abolish the federal department of education [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2645.58s)]
*  um, and they they say this is uh nbc news is where they got it from so [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2652.22s)]
*  How about that? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2658.7s)]
*  Um, where will the kids go to get the shit kicked out of them by bullies? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2661.9s)]
*  Well, of course this isn't you know abolishing the department of education wouldn't even be abolishing public school [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2664.78s)]
*  It would simply be kind of kicking it back to the states and not having washington dc [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2672.2200000000003s)]
*  um, you know, uh centralized the the control of education and the um [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2677.82s)]
*  What's the word that i'm i'm looking through the curriculum? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2685.02s)]
*  uh, it is a first of all just because a few people and I know particularly that this is uh, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2687.98s)]
*  I've seen some libertarians who are saying this [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2695.1000000000004s)]
*  It is true that doing this through an executive order is not as ideal [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2697.82s)]
*  As doing this through an act of congress [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2703.5800000000004s)]
*  You know the concern being another democrat could come right back in and then just undo all of trump's executive orders. Um [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2707.02s)]
*  While that is true [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2714.2200000000003s)]
*  It is still preferable to not doing it at all [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2715.82s)]
*  So this is I don't know why i'm i'm telling you i'm gonna have to get out of the game of making this [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2719.42s)]
*  Exact point because I just make it too much that's starting to drive me crazy. You know what I mean? Like it's like [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2724.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes, okay [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2729.8199999999997s)]
*  By the way thomas massie has just introduced legislation into the congress to do this [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2730.8599999999997s)]
*  so [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2736.8599999999997s)]
*  What the move here would be to do it through executive order immediately and then really champion [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2737.74s)]
*  codifying it into law through uh, um the congress but [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2744.04s)]
*  This would just be [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2748.62s)]
*  Such a remarkable win for the country [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2750.46s)]
*  I mean just a a win for education a win for uh, the taxpayer [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2753.6600000000003s)]
*  There's just nothing but wasted money and and totally at the expense of children's education to have this [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2759.7400000000002s)]
*  ridiculous socialist model of [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2767.48s)]
*  centralized control over the indoctrination of children [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2771.2400000000002s)]
*  Like why it makes no sense and by the way, I will go a step further and say [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2775.76s)]
*  Public school in general makes no sense. You know [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2781.6800000000003s)]
*  There's it it's really funny because there's kind of like these things [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2785.1200000000003s)]
*  This is to take it back to libertarianism 101 for a second here [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2789.52s)]
*  But there are so many of these things that like because we're used to the government doing it [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2793.44s)]
*  People just take it for granted that the government does it and then if you're against the government doing it [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2798.8s)]
*  They're like, well, you must be against the service, you know, like it like if there was um [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2803.92s)]
*  if there was like the the [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2809.92s)]
*  department of shoes [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2812.54s)]
*  In you know in dc that we make all the shoes in the country, which you know [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2814.72s)]
*  It sounds kind of goofy but like socialist countries actually had things like this [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2819.44s)]
*  You know what? I mean like they had centralized you know, like in the soviet union [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2822.72s)]
*  You could only get that one crappy car or whatever, you know, like there were experiments like this but [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2826.16s)]
*  It so you have this department of shoes and they make all the shoes and all americans have the exact same shoes [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2831.52s)]
*  And obviously the government's making them. So it's like the crummiest pair of uncomfortable shoes [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2838.0s)]
*  And then you were like, hey [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2843.04s)]
*  I think we should abolish this department of shoes and just let the market take care of this and then someone's like [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2844.08s)]
*  Oh, so you're against people having shoes on their feet [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2848.88s)]
*  You think everyone should just walk around barefoot and it's like no, that's not exactly my claim [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2851.92s)]
*  Now when I use the example of shoes [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2856.7200000000003s)]
*  Nobody thinks that way because we already have it completely decentralized and if you may notice [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2859.36s)]
*  Everybody's got shoes on their feet like notice that next time you're outside [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2864.8s)]
*  Even drive through a really poor neighborhood and people have shoes on their feet. Okay, there's some exceptions to this [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2868.7200000000003s)]
*  Generally speaking though. It's not a major issue of like getting shoes to people, you know [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2874.7200000000003s)]
*  Because the market takes care of it as as with everything the market provides [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2879.84s)]
*  A better quality product at a cheaper price that is more tailored to what the consumer actually wants [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2885.36s)]
*  yet somehow [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2891.52s)]
*  When it comes to education [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2893.36s)]
*  There there is this idea that the government must do it because and look I can understand on some level where people feel like [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2895.68s)]
*  Well, look, we want to make sure that every kid is provided with [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2903.44s)]
*  Education, but again, you could make the same argument with shoes and say well [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2907.34s)]
*  We have to make sure that everyone is provided shoes and the truth is like [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2910.88s)]
*  Once you take an example like shoes you realize that you're like, okay [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2915.76s)]
*  Yeah [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2919.36s)]
*  But even if our concern is that everyone is provided with these or that if somebody's so poor that they can't [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2919.52s)]
*  Get shoes. They can't afford them. We want to make sure someone gives that to them [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2925.6800000000003s)]
*  That you can't jump from that to therefore. It must be centralized in washington dc [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2929.92s)]
*  You just be like yeah, we could have charities do that. We could raise money for that [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2934.8s)]
*  You know what? I mean like we could have you know, the companies themselves can [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2938.88s)]
*  Do things like ask you if you want to pay a dollar more when you get your shoes because that goes toward the shoes of less [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2943.2000000000003s)]
*  Fortunate people like there's just lots of other options and likewise with education when you think about it [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2948.4s)]
*  Uh, you think about public education government schools? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2954.88s)]
*  The idea that you're going hey, there are these like [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2960.1600000000003s)]
*  There are the there's poor people [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2964.7200000000003s)]
*  And they can't afford school so the government comes in and gives it to them [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2967.3599999999997s)]
*  That is just not what happens. That's not actually true [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2971.2s)]
*  um, the the truth is that when in all of these neighbors even in like poor communities in poor neighborhoods and poor towns [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2975.9199999999996s)]
*  They the people there are paying taxes [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2985.4399999999996s)]
*  They're paying for the schools and you could say like maybe these people [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2988.64s)]
*  Are maybe they're they're unemployed or maybe they make so little money that they don't really pay any federal income taxes [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=2993.76s)]
*  But what's paying for the schools is the property taxes and all of them are paying that either directly or indirectly [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3000.08s)]
*  You know, like if you even if you rent an apartment [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3006.4s)]
*  You are paying for the property tax because that has to be [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3010.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, that has to be factored in to the rent price [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3014.48s)]
*  You know, like if if uh, if if somebody is paying [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3018.64s)]
*  You know five hundred dollars a month and a landlord [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3022.08s)]
*  Let's say just to keep the numbers easier say they're paying a thousand dollars a month for uh for their mortgage [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3024.7999999999997s)]
*  and then another two hundred dollars a month for the [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3030.4s)]
*  Property tax well, they've got to charge you at least [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3034.16s)]
*  1201 to make a profit off that it's not a business. Otherwise, it's a charity [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3037.42s)]
*  And so you're paying for the property tax [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3041.8399999999997s)]
*  So really what the government is doing is stealing your money from you and then coming in [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3044.7999999999997s)]
*  Paying a whole bunch of bureaucrats six-figure salaries and then with the crumbs that are remaining giving you these government schools [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3050.4s)]
*  and again if your if your argument was that um [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3058.08s)]
*  You know like well the the you know, there are some people who just can't afford to educate their children [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3063.12s)]
*  We must have the government come in and do this [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3068.32s)]
*  Ask yourself a follow-up question. How's the government doing at that? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3071.44s)]
*  You know, is it like is it could you say right now that like um, you know in america [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3075.2s)]
*  We have some poor neighborhoods. We have some high crime areas, but at least they they're all getting a great education in their government schools [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3081.8399999999997s)]
*  No, they can't even read at grade level. They're graduating illiterate kids. It's just the wildest failure [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3089.52s)]
*  It's every bit as much of a failure is that shitty soviet car that everyone makes fun of I can't remember the name of it [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3096.08s)]
*  um [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3102.72s)]
*  and so it's just you know the whole thing when you really think about it, it's like the [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3103.76s)]
*  The task [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3109.2000000000003s)]
*  Is so doable like what are we really talking about when you talk about school? You're talking about what? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3110.6400000000003s)]
*  Teaching kids reading writing and arithmetic maybe as they get older a little bit of english and history [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3116.7200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like what? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3122.0s)]
*  This is totally doable [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3125.2000000000003s)]
*  Communities can come together and do this [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3127.26s)]
*  This does not need to come from washington dc and have orders barked at you know, like from [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3129.6000000000004s)]
*  bureaucrats in dc [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3136.86s)]
*  Uh, and and we've had an experiment in this it's been it the department of education has not been around that long [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3138.48s)]
*  Um, I mean, you know, I say that maybe that's my age speaking [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3145.52s)]
*  But it's been I think it was under jimmy carter [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3148.5600000000004s)]
*  I want to say it's in the 70s. I think the late 70s is when the department of education was created and [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3150.6400000000003s)]
*  So we've been running an experiment [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3156.6400000000003s)]
*  We've done this for about 50 years. Does anybody here think does anyone think the country's gotten smarter over these 50 years? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3158.7999999999997s)]
*  Does anyone think the country is better educated now than they were back then? I mean I [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3165.52s)]
*  you know, I you ever see like where they'll have like those old like um high school tests from like [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3170.4s)]
*  1920 and you're like, whoa, this is what they were asking the kids back then [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3177.42s)]
*  We were a much smarter country before we went to this bullshit socialist indoctrination model [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3181.8399999999997s)]
*  And so this is a great step in that direction and again just another signal that donald trump [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3187.68s)]
*  Might actually mean business this time and kind of want to do some big bold things and again [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3194.88s)]
*  between doge and this move and the usa id stuff and like it's like [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3202.16s)]
*  It's not just that he wants to do big legacy building things [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3208.16s)]
*  but it's like he wants to do big legacy building things and he sees the way to do that as [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3211.6s)]
*  Like draining the swamp cutting the government exposing the corruption everybody every president always wants to do big legacy building things [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3217.6s)]
*  That's why george w bush wanted. Um [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3225.6s)]
*  In 2008 at the bucarus summit. That's why he wanted to give ukraine a full map a full member action [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3228.32s)]
*  program [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3236.4s)]
*  Um, then he didn't end up getting that they just made the promise that they'd bring him in but they said that was it scott [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3237.44s)]
*  Details it in his book provoked very well, but that's he was just like well, this is for my legacy [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3242.64s)]
*  The war in iraq didn't work out. So i'm gonna do something big [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3248.48s)]
*  And there was angela merkel who was like, you know, this really might piss off the russians. You maybe don't want to do this [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3252.4s)]
*  um, but anyway, uh, so this is a very I don't know what else to say, but it's a very positive move. Um, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3257.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, I could say the other thing by the way, which is to me is the compromise position. Um, but like corey [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3264.96s)]
*  De angelo's has been the guy who's really pushed this for many many years now and had some real success in it now [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3271.44s)]
*  My my position would just be abolish government schools [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3277.04s)]
*  Let people do it, you know, like people can the the unbelievable task of like teaching a kid how to read is something that human [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3281.04s)]
*  beings are actually capable of figuring out and did figure out for [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3288.16s)]
*  Thousands of years before it was done in washington dc. Um [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3292.72s)]
*  But the you know his whole like school choice thing [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3296.88s)]
*  Is I it's almost impossible to argue against like the and essentially what what the school choice? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3301.1200000000003s)]
*  Idea is is that you basically just look at so you could look at um [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3308.5600000000004s)]
*  How much money say and say given in a state? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3314.8s)]
*  There's a certain amount of money that they spend to educate the kids. So there's a certain number like per student per year [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3317.84s)]
*  Per student per year. It's outrageously high. I think in in in new york city [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3324.16s)]
*  I think it was 20 grand per student per year was the cost of of educating kids [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3328.88s)]
*  And so corey de angelo's and other school choice advocates just say, okay, so you're spending [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3334.4s)]
*  20 grand per student per year. Here's what we're going to do [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3340.72s)]
*  You're just going to give that as a voucher to the parents [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3344.88s)]
*  Okay [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3348.08s)]
*  They get this voucher that's worth 20 grand a year and they can choose which school to use it at [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3349.04s)]
*  And now you'd have a situation where you empower the parents rather than empowering the teachers union [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3354.72s)]
*  Rather than empowering dc and you let the parents [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3360.64s)]
*  Have the chips and the schools have to compete now [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3364.08s)]
*  Over getting the parents to give them their voucher because they get 20 grand for each parent who gives them their voucher [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3367.92s)]
*  And so you immediately would just introduce market forces back into school [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3373.52s)]
*  and now at least the schools would have to [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3378.7200000000003s)]
*  Demonstrate some value now the school goes [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3382.0s)]
*  Hey, everyone in our school is reading it at grade level and there's very little bullying or there's very little violence and there's very [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3385.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like they have the same the same thing that private schools do right now [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3391.84s)]
*  Right, which is why wealthy people send their kids to private schools when they have the option to [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3397.1200000000003s)]
*  Um [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3403.52s)]
*  It just introduced those market forces into school for everybody and like there's no reason why if you know [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3404.72s)]
*  It's it's so disgusting when you think about it that it's like the people [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3411.12s)]
*  Who you know? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3416.0s)]
*  Okay, like me, you know the people who are able to send their kids to like the elite schools that are very expensive [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3418.24s)]
*  They're able to do that and yet these people are forced [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3424.96s)]
*  They don't have the resources that that some others have and yet they're forced to pay this [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3428.4s)]
*  And that they don't even get control of it [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3433.92s)]
*  You know, it's like the fact that new york city is spending 20 grand per student per year [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3436.32s)]
*  Why shouldn't you let the parent now the parent has like real money that they can go and be in the same position [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3442.0800000000004s)]
*  They can be as privileged as the people who get to send their kids to private school where they have the chips [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3448.2400000000002s)]
*  They're the one with the money and you have to work for them and you have to work to [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3453.7599999999998s)]
*  to keep their uh [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3458.24s)]
*  To keep their business. It's such a better model than what we have right now [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3460.16s)]
*  So there's just a lot of different things that can be done in education even short of the ideal [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3464.48s)]
*  Which would just be to abolish government schools [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3469.92s)]
*  but anyway [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3474.08s)]
*  long [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3476.08s)]
*  Long story short. This is a very good move anything you want to add rob. We'll we'll wrap up on that [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3477.28s)]
*  Uh prosecute façade prosecute façade. There we go. That was a nice we really bookended [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3482.08s)]

*  I'll i'll bring equipment with me or rob [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3497.52s)]
*  I should say i'll bring rob with me and count on him to bring equipment with him [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zun29qjMaPM&t=3499.76s)]
