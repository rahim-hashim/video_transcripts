**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04)
*  What's up, what's up? Hello everybody. Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the fire Bernstein. How are you doing today? Good, sir. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=11.8s)]
*  You know, I slept on my neck weird last night and I don't like being old. If we have to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=16.9s)]
*  start pitching words to get the baby blood, I'm in just as someone in the deep state can [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=22.64s)]
*  reach out and let me know. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=26.42s)]
*  It's all, it's really all it takes to change your mind. Yeah, it is a thing, dude. Getting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=28.64s)]
*  old. I do think like for me it was there. There was something it's probably around your [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=32.28s)]
*  age. It's like mid thirties is like when you start just like, you just like slowly start [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=37.64s)]
*  noticing like, oh, like, you know, like something hurts and you're like, oh yeah, it'll get [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=43.52s)]
*  better. It'll go away. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  It doesn't. I'm doing the Frankenstein wall today of, er, and there's like things like [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  if you fuck up your neck or fuck up your back or something like that, whereas like in your [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=56.44s)]
*  twenties it'd be like, ah, I was stupid that I did that. But then like when you get closer [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=60.4s)]
*  to 40, it's more like, ah, dude, I just fucked up like the next few weeks. Like the like [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=65.84s)]
*  this is going to suck now for a while. That's fun. But you know, you're smarter and stuff. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=72.2s)]
*  So that's cool. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=76.42s)]
*  I guess that's the, uh, yep. I'm smart enough to learn no more porn on the pillow with the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=78.18s)]
*  this and then you got to go to your desk like an adult. I guess I have a recent age. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=82.52s)]
*  I just learned to make these adjustments. We run a classier show and you guys want to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=87.96s)]
*  hear the news. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=93.84s)]
*  It's it is true. It's just, it's so much more, um, dignified to hurt yourself during sex. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=94.84s)]
*  If it makes sense that like the real thing. Uh, okay. Oh, by the way, let's start off [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=100.44s)]
*  just some quick plugs before we get into the meat of today's episode. Um, we, we're going [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=105.32s)]
*  to be in Boston, uh, coming up very soon. Looking forward to that. Come on out, Boston. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=111.88s)]
*  Um, we always, we always, uh, fill up the shows in Boston. So if you want to come get [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=116.6s)]
*  them now, cause these shows will sell out, uh, comicdavidsmith.com and we're, we're traveling [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=120.92s)]
*  all over the place for the rest of the year. So come, come see us there. And then Rob, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=125.66s)]
*  you got some, some gigs coming up, I believe. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=129.38s)]
*  I've got a steamboat and now I'm confused cause I got it wrong the last time. Idaho [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  and Iowa. That's all kind of the same state to me. I think it's an Idaho. I don't know. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=136.72s)]
*  Go to my website, robburnsteincomedy.com. I got two dates coming up and one of them's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=141.04s)]
*  in a state that starts with an I, and I'm really looking forward to being there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=145.04s)]
*  There you go. Uh, also I should, uh, reminder. I know I've told you guys, I'm, I'm debating, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=148.68s)]
*  uh, Alex Norway. Uh, I just still, I will learn his name by the time we debate, uh, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=153.72s)]
*  debating, uh, uh, immigration at the SoHo forum. The SoHo forum.org is the website to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=159.6s)]
*  go if you want to come see it live, if you're in the New York city area, also little teaser [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=167.32s)]
*  for you. Uh, got some big ones coming up. Not going to tell you what they are, but, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=172.32s)]
*  uh, we've got a few, few big, big shows coming up that I'm very excited to do. Um, so a couple [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  years ago when you said that it was very obvious and now there's a couple different options [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=185.04s)]
*  on the table. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=189.28s)]
*  Yes, it's, uh, well, one of them's the obvious one. That's all I'll say. And then, uh, and, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=190.6s)]
*  and then a couple, one, uh, one of them, I'm doing a tomorrow, doing a big show that I've [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=197.4s)]
*  never done before. So very excited, uh, to go do that. Um, not sure. I'm not sure when [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=201.44s)]
*  it's coming out, but we're recording it tomorrow. So probably soon. Uh, okay. So there's a few [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=207.08s)]
*  things going on. Uh, one of the things that I wanted to talk about on, on the show that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=212.72s)]
*  I don't, we may have briefly mentioned it, but I don't think we've really given it too [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=218.16s)]
*  much attention, but I do find this to be very interesting. Um, because it's such, it's such [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  a comment on kind of the, the moment that we're living in. And obviously there's all [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=226.72s)]
*  these kind of major themes of 2025 so far. And one of, one of the major ones being the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=230.56s)]
*  disastrous state of the democratic party. And obviously this has to do with many factors. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=237.8s)]
*  But really the, you know, losing the propaganda apparatus of the corporate media is probably [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=244.52s)]
*  the biggest one. It's not just that they lost an election. It's that they lost the mechanism [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=251.1s)]
*  by which they win elections. And so anyway, so the topic that I'm thinking about is, uh, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=257.06s)]
*  which I'm curious if you've watched any of it, but have you seen Gavin Newsom has started [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=263.96s)]
*  a podcast? I've seen clips. Yeah, same with me. I've just seen clips. I'm not going to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=268.36s)]
*  sit down and watch an episode of Gavin Newsom. Um, but it is, it's, look, it's just as somebody [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=272.96s)]
*  who was, I mean, I'm not like first generation of podcasters. Maybe I'd be like second generation. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  Um, there were people who were at it before me, but for somebody who was, um, I, you know, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=287.24s)]
*  I, I'm trying to think like around when I first, cause I, I was doing part of the problem [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  in my apartment in Brooklyn in 2012. I know that, um, so as before even we went to stand [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=300.42s)]
*  up New York labs and before, but I had done skanks and I had done hammer fisting originally. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=306.7s)]
*  So that, that would have to have been around 2009, 2010, um, that first started speaking, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=314.26s)]
*  you know, having conversations that we were recording and then putting on the internet. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=322.3s)]
*  And so it's just, you know, at this point now, you know, back then it was like a few [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  comedians had podcasts, but it wasn't, it certainly wasn't like a thing that everybody [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  had and it was kind of a weird fit. It was a thing you'd almost have to explain to somebody [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=337.54s)]
*  that, but to see now just as someone who's just been in this for a while, that the move [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=342.06s)]
*  for the darling of the democratic party, the guy who kind of all of the democratic, you [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=349.26s)]
*  know, big wigs wanted to run for president, but couldn't either convince him to, or couldn't [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=354.54s)]
*  maneuver around Kamala Harris, um, to see that as he's clearly, I mean, I don't think [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=359.22s)]
*  this is too much of a leap to say clearly building toward a 28 potential run. Just imagine [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=366.06s)]
*  Rob how crazy it is that like the move is, well, you're going to have to go start a podcast [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=372.66s)]
*  and it is the correct move. I'm not even like criticizing him for that. Like that is the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=378.42s)]
*  thing to go do now. And that in itself is just so wild to me. And I just like, I love [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=381.9s)]
*  that. You know, it's, I think it's great as awful as he is. How crazy is it that that's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=387.5s)]
*  now what the, the ruling class has to do in order to get somewhere is, you know, and obviously [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=391.85999999999996s)]
*  it's a different version, but it's like, wait, they have to do what me and Lewis did in 2010. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  Like that's what they're there. But yes, that is the move. Um, so anyway, that's just kind [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=405.5s)]
*  of interesting in my mind. But before we get into it, cause I wanted to play a couple [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=410.5s)]
*  clips, uh, um, from he had, um, uh, what's his name? Uh, Tim waltz on his show, the, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=413.62s)]
*  uh, vice presidential candidate in the last election. I thought it was, it's kind of interesting [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=421.06s)]
*  to me, but of the, like, I'm just curious to you were like of the clips you've seen, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=425.2s)]
*  what do you think of this move? Gavin Newsom getting out there on a podcast. What do you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=429.74s)]
*  think about him being the democratic, you know, uh, potential nominee or any of that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=433.66s)]
*  stuff? All right. I got a lot on this. So, all right, let's have it. You know, there [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=439.26s)]
*  was a time in this world where you had to put on a suit to look like you were in the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=442.9s)]
*  professional class and go and get a job. And this speaks to the degration of the news networks [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=446.86s)]
*  where it used to be in order to be treated seriously, you needed to have a, an academic [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=452.09999999999997s)]
*  standing or you needed to look like you're in this beautiful studio. And that's why people [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  took you seriously. And those guys so eroded their credibility that suddenly doing the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=461.62s)]
*  makeshift thing that we all did because we couldn't afford to be in the big news studios and [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=466.86s)]
*  we weren't given those opportunities. But then we brought something different to the market, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=471.09999999999997s)]
*  which was truth. And now this is almost the suit and tie of truth. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=474.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, dude, it's such a good point, Rob. Yes, not. He's not in the big studio. He's doing [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=478.18s)]
*  the makeshift thing, which almost signals to people, oh, this, this might be truthful. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=483.3s)]
*  So that's one element. Then the next element, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just keep that thought in [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=487.24s)]
*  mind, because that's such a good point. And it does. It's like, it's like in the 90s, when [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=491.64000000000004s)]
*  billionaires started wearing t shirts and jeans, like what it all it all of a sudden became a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=496.8s)]
*  thing where Steve Jobs would give his his presentations just in a t shirt and jeans. It's [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=502.12s)]
*  almost like, oh, you have to like assume the aesthetic of the regular guy in order to like [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  talk to the regular guy. And there's just something that's a really interesting observation [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=514.16s)]
*  really is something to that that they now have to almost like abandon the cable newsy [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=517.72s)]
*  looking background, because our our monkey brains have just associated that with liar so much that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=523.72s)]
*  you just come off as a liar if you're in that environment at all. Sorry, continue. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=531.0s)]
*  And then there's there's two more qualities to it. The next is I think, in part, Donald Trump [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=535.32s)]
*  became president because he's incredible at television and television is a talent. I think [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=540.76s)]
*  that goes all the way back to I think it was when JFK beat Nixon, because he looked good and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=546.2s)]
*  Nelson wouldn't wear makeup. And so there there is a quality to the way that we consume information [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=551.4s)]
*  now. Now, ideally, you would just be a great governor, and you would go sell look at how well [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=556.92s)]
*  I've done in my state. And that would be the way and go to sell yourself. But that's not the he's [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=562.36s)]
*  a terrible governor. That's not the skill set that he has. And so as we come into the next election [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=566.92s)]
*  cycle, and you basically have to be great at radio now, because that's going to be the new place that [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=571.64s)]
*  you go to to try and sell yourself. It's it's almost smart to get good at radio, because and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=575.88s)]
*  I think that might be why Michelle Obama is trying to launch a podcast to which she's terrible. And [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=582.84s)]
*  it's it's it's unbelievable how bad it is. And maybe maybe we could delve into that one another [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=587.56s)]
*  episode because it's shocking. And you know, it's we could even talk about it a little bit today, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=592.28s)]
*  because it is interesting how much you know, podcasting is I know I used when we were going [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=597.64s)]
*  back and forth with Jonah Goldberg, I use the the metaphor of like fighting and how the old school [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=605.08s)]
*  people found out they couldn't fight in the UFC. But there is something about it that is kind of [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=610.12s)]
*  similar in a way. Maybe it's just that I'm a fan of both the two things. So I see the parallels. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=615.32s)]
*  But like, there's, there's something where it's like revealing of what you really got. Now you [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=620.6s)]
*  could talk a tough game or something like that. But let me see you in a fight. Let me see when [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=625.96s)]
*  you're hurt and you're tired. And then you really test character. There is something about podcasting [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=629.96s)]
*  that like actually tests, like it just it separates the wheat from the chip. Like, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=636.52s)]
*  you're like, what do you really have? What do you really have to say? Let me get let me get into [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=641.96s)]
*  your mind and see if you actually have something here. And for all the talk over these years of [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=647.08s)]
*  how somehow it was always so ridiculous, but that Michelle Obama was like the dream scenario that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=652.2s)]
*  she would come and run for president or something. Hey, you just watch her. And again, I've only seen [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=657.56s)]
*  some of the clips, but it is like, she is boring. She is totally she's nasty. She's got like a real [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=661.8s)]
*  kind of like bitter thing to her. And she's vapid. Like, there's just like, I don't know, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=673.16s)]
*  it was very interesting. And the other thing that's so interesting about that is the numbers have [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=678.76s)]
*  just been abysmal. Well, you see her as she's getting like, she's I don't know, she had like a [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=682.52s)]
*  video that had like 40,000 downloads or views on YouTube or whatever or something. And you're like, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=687.56s)]
*  what this fucking Michelle Obama? Really? She can't put together a couple hundred thousand [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=692.04s)]
*  views on an episode. Anyway, sorry, continue. But it is very interesting. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=697.48s)]
*  And just on that topic, it's odd how much her brother looks like a lady shaved her way. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=701.64s)]
*  It's just so backwards that apparently that's a man and she's a lady. But I guess just bad genetics. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=706.12s)]
*  Going back to going back to Gavin Newsom, I think in this media climate, it's good to practice [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=715.0s)]
*  podcasting. If you want to be in politics, I think it's probably a necessary tool. I don't agree with [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=721.0s)]
*  a single one of Gavin Newsom's policies. I think he's an evil and bad person. With that said, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=726.12s)]
*  he is a fantastic salesperson and a fantastic liar. And there's kind of a rule in sales. Don't [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=731.96s)]
*  fear the phone. And there's like a human nature. If things aren't going well, you don't want to [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  talk to your customers. But there's a signal and people the most the people with devil skills are [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=743.1600000000001s)]
*  the best at this. When things aren't going well, you'll see more of them because it kind of [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=750.76s)]
*  showcases the confidence that they're still willing to take your calls or still be in front [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=755.08s)]
*  of the cameras and saying everything's going great. So Gavin Newsom's actually very smart and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=758.6s)]
*  very skilled that he's willing and unlike anyone else in the Democratic Party, and we're going to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=764.2s)]
*  see in this clip, he's willing to talk to people with very different points of views. And he's [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=768.6s)]
*  willing to engage with those topics. And it's a very smart sales and persuasion technique that [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=774.52s)]
*  he's willing to actually engage and get in front of this stuff and not go and hide after you have [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=781.4s)]
*  these fires, fires, incidents. Yeah, I look, I mean, I think that's exactly right. And there is, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=786.44s)]
*  look, you can't deny he's got he's incredibly talented. And he's a talented politician. Now, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=793.08s)]
*  I completely agree with you. And I think that kind of almost goes without saying. Yes, obviously, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=803.8000000000001s)]
*  his policies have been a disaster. I mean, he's been a truly, he's been a uniquely terrible [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=809.08s)]
*  governor. Like what he's done with the state of California is as bad a job as I could think of [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=816.84s)]
*  any governor doing with any state. But like, there is something, you know, he's an interesting [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=823.8s)]
*  figure, because he is in a way he is like a traditional politician. And a very good one, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=829.0s)]
*  like a very good traditional politician. I think the way I look at it is kind of like, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=840.28s)]
*  in my lifetime, I think pretty undeniably, the most talented politicians have been Bill Clinton [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=848.28s)]
*  and Barack Obama. For people, Bill Clinton lost a step. I think he did too many drugs when he was [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=855.88s)]
*  young. And it kind of fucked him up later in life. Like he doesn't, he doesn't have it anymore. But [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=862.12s)]
*  for people who, like are around my age, like if you remember the 90s, I mean, he was just like, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=868.4399999999999s)]
*  the guy, I mean, he just charmed the pants off of everybody, then rip some pants off of some people [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=876.76s)]
*  against their will. But that's another story for another day. But he was just incredibly smooth. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=883.08s)]
*  And he had this like, very, like unique ability. You know, I mean, I wasn't alive for like, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=888.9200000000001s)]
*  Jack Kennedy. And people would say similar things about him. And maybe for his time, you know, like [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=896.12s)]
*  1960 is just such a different culture and a different time that it may be it was, but it [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=902.44s)]
*  wasn't like what Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton could go on like, at the time, right? It was almost like, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=907.1600000000001s)]
*  if you think about the version of going on a podcast, at the time, what Bill Clinton would [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=912.28s)]
*  do is like go on MTV, and just get the kids like into what he was doing. He was really like just [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=917.16s)]
*  incredible. And very, very good, not just good at like giving a speech. But really good at interacting, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=923.88s)]
*  really good at like winning people over and being charming. And then Barack Obama was never quite as [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=933.3199999999999s)]
*  good at the interacting as Bill Clinton was. But his speech giving like blew him out of the water. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=939.88s)]
*  I mean, he was just in he was truly like in his prime, Barack Obama was a master orator, like [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=946.52s)]
*  just on another level, incredible, and wrote a lot of his own speeches to I mean, I know he had he [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=955.96s)]
*  had speech writers as they all do, but he wrote a lot of his own speeches and they were like, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=962.2s)]
*  excellent, excellent speeches. Gavin Newsom can literally be standing in front of a state on fire [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=966.04s)]
*  and going we're doing the best possible job of any buddy who's ever stood here. He's got that Trump [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=971.16s)]
*  quality. Well, well, style of mind. Trump in a way, the way I look at it is like, I think Bill [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=976.12s)]
*  Clinton, Barack Obama were the best politicians of my life. Trump is like an anti politician, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=982.6s)]
*  almost, which is I'm not saying there aren't similarities between the two, but it's like, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=988.52s)]
*  he's a whole different thing. He decided like, I'm not going to do that thing, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=992.9200000000001s)]
*  that I'm not going to do the politician thing. I'm just Donald Trump. Now, Gavin Newsom is like, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=997.32s)]
*  he's a very talented traditional politician. I don't exactly know, in this current market, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1003.72s)]
*  the current culture of the United States of America, is there a market for a traditional [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1012.76s)]
*  politician? I'm not so sure of that. It's like, much like you said with the idea that the cable [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1016.9200000000001s)]
*  news look has just been so degraded that people don't want to see that anymore. I think that [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1023.96s)]
*  might be true for the traditional politician too. However, when you see Gavin Newsom, and especially [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1029.8s)]
*  when you contrast it with who else the Democrats have, you kind of got to take that guy seriously. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1036.8400000000001s)]
*  You're like, okay, no, listen, this guy is both in terms of IQ, in terms of just rhetorical abilities, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1044.36s)]
*  he's levels above the rest of these guys. There's really no one else the Democrats have [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1056.9199999999998s)]
*  who's at that level. That's been clear the more we've seen of all these Democrats. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1061.8s)]
*  I will say that, as I said at the beginning, and as you put quite well, there's no question this is [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1068.3600000000001s)]
*  the right move. From a political point of view, it's like, yeah, dude, you got to get on podcasts, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1076.0400000000002s)]
*  you got to argue with people on the other side, you got to be talking about the current thing, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1080.8400000000001s)]
*  you got to be trying to sell some type of compelling message. There's no question that that's [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1086.0400000000002s)]
*  there. The glaring issue you have is, like as you said, Rob, just the disaster that is California, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1092.44s)]
*  and the wildfires are almost the least of it at this point. I mean, it's a big thing, but [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1103.3200000000002s)]
*  it's the disaster that is the state of California, where people have, on his watch, people have been [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1107.56s)]
*  fleeing the state by the hundreds of thousands. When it comes to a situation with a country [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1118.04s)]
*  ours, where you have these United States and there is freedom of movement between all of them, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1127.08s)]
*  there's just no better indicator of your success or failure. People voting with their feet is the [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1134.84s)]
*  most powerful endorsement or vice versa of a state. If you're doing a great job, people flood [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1142.84s)]
*  in. If you're doing a terrible job, people flood out, and people are flooding out of California, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1149.72s)]
*  and for obvious reasons. All you have to do is go to a major city in California, and you'd be like, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1154.12s)]
*  oh, that's why people are leaving, because of that. Anyway, the other issue that they have is that [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1161.3999999999999s)]
*  it does seem to me that there's a lack of substance issue with Gavin Newsom, and at least [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1169.72s)]
*  it seems to me from all the clips I've seen, the major problem that he has is that it's like [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1180.04s)]
*  he's a very nicely wrapped present, but there is nothing inside. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1186.52s)]
*  And a bad track record. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1195.56s)]
*  A bad track record. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1197.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a bad track record, and then he's really got no, there doesn't seem to be any real [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1198.2s)]
*  argument that he's there to make. And so that's an issue too. But anyway, so this is all fascinating [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1203.32s)]
*  to me. And of course, the conversation that is dominant in the Democratic Party right now, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1210.6s)]
*  which is the kind of like, what do we do from here talk? I also just find it very interesting [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1217.0s)]
*  how they're just, they're at such a, they have such an inability to grapple with what actually [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1224.3600000000001s)]
*  just happened and why it just happened. And it's interesting to see them spin their wheels. So [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1229.96s)]
*  anyway, let's go to this clip from the Gavin Newsom podcast. I believe it's called Meet [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1236.0400000000002s)]
*  Gavin Newsom. Am I right about that? Anyway, let's go check out that clip. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1241.64s)]
*  Have they figured it out that the identity piece of this is more important than the actual substance [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1248.68s)]
*  behind it? Well, they've been doing it for decades. I mean, we've, we've, we've saw the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1255.16s)]
*  welfare of Queens. They've seen the Southern strategy. We've seen it over and over. It's an [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1258.28s)]
*  old playbook and we're as dumb as we want to be that we allow them to do this with CRT and ESG, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1261.96s)]
*  DEI and every three letter word. And then they demonize people. Yeah, demonize and they weaponize [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1266.68s)]
*  grievance. They other people, they talk down to people, past people, they humiliate people, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1271.3200000000002s)]
*  they weaponize difficult issues. But the problem line is, and I think it goes back to what we [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1275.8s)]
*  began with is, and I applaud you for this, is we cannot continue to be on the defense reacting to [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1280.52s)]
*  this. We gotta go on the offense. We gotta meet people where they are. But I also think this, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1286.9199999999998s)]
*  and this is where, you know, it's already here. It's, isn't it like, is it, you get what I'm saying [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1291.6399999999999s)]
*  when I say it's like a beautifully wrapped present, but there's no gift inside. It's just already [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1300.6s)]
*  like, what, what is this? This, this is empty slogan earring. Like there's no actual comment [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1305.24s)]
*  being made here. We can't play defense. We gotta play offense and we gotta meet people where they're [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1312.1200000000001s)]
*  at. What, what does any of that mean? Like, I'm sorry, maybe I'm the dumb one here. Speak slower [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1316.28s)]
*  so I can understand. What does any of that mean? What are you saying? Oh, it's identity that matters [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1323.08s)]
*  and they weaponize it and they humiliate people and they've like, again, this is like, it sounds [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1330.04s)]
*  like a James Lindsay defining the woke, right? And then you give a definition that applies to [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1335.8799999999999s)]
*  everybody, you know, well, they're, they're awakening to an injustice and they want to [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1342.12s)]
*  put themselves in a position of power. Like, yeah, that's politics. What do we, isn't it wild? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1348.2s)]
*  I mean, by the way, you know, you have two of the, this conversation is happening between two of [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1354.6799999999998s)]
*  the most aggressive lockdown governors and the, the two of the governors who were the biggest [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1362.12s)]
*  champions of black lives matter. And you're, you're talking about how they use identity [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1369.7199999999998s)]
*  and they demonize others and attempt to humiliate them. They use important issues to demonize others. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1375.9599999999998s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. Like I have, I have some mild memories of being unvaccinated in 2021 and 22. And I felt [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1382.76s)]
*  like the finger was pointed at us a little bit. But anyway, it's just, this is the point I'm making. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1393.0s)]
*  It's like the, one of the things it's like the, the podcasting, the podcast world didn't just blow up [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1398.6s)]
*  because it was on the internet instead of being on the TV. I mean, that is part of it about, you know, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1410.44s)]
*  like people are on their, their phones and their computers more and they're on televisions less, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1416.68s)]
*  but it was also that there was just substantive conversations being had. And you know, people can, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1421.8s)]
*  you can mock the bro podcast vibe or whatever. And there's like part of that's fair. You know, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1430.04s)]
*  it is, there's no question. It's, it's kind of like, there's a, there's a bro energy to a lot of [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1436.76s)]
*  the popular podcasts, but there's also just like organic, substantive conversations that are [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1441.64s)]
*  happening. And this is just, it's too weird and nothing like you got to say something. I don't [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1449.16s)]
*  know. Any thoughts on this, Robert, you want to jump back in? I agree with you that in the first [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1456.12s)]
*  half of this, he absolutely says nothing of substance, but the second half I thought was [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1460.36s)]
*  interesting. Yes. Yes. All right. Let's keep playing. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1464.28s)]
*  Conversation I'm trying to have is you got to respect people you disagree with even it can't [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1468.44s)]
*  just dismiss people. This is, well, this, this motion of their ass, I do, but I don't know if [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1474.68s)]
*  we're going to fall into that place where we want to, okay, we challenge you to do a, you know, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1484.68s)]
*  a WWE fight here type of thing. Pause it one more time. Cause I do just want to make this point. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1489.16s)]
*  There is, and I find this to be fascinating, particularly after the years of pushing the, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1495.64s)]
*  the gender stuff, but there is a, there's a realization amongst Democrats that they are [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1503.96s)]
*  two beta and that they need, I mean, literally, I think I, I want to say who was it. It was Van [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1511.8s)]
*  Jones. I believe I heard on CNN the other day explicitly say we need alphas on our side. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1519.88s)]
*  There's just, even the Democrats eventually recognized that, oh yeah, Donald Trump is out [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1528.6000000000001s)]
*  alpha in us. That's a big component to what's going on here, which I don't know how that wasn't [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1537.08s)]
*  obvious to everybody. It literally was like, I had a huge chunk on it in my, my first comedy [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1542.6s)]
*  hour special Libertas about how Donald Trump just out alphaed everybody. Like that was so obvious [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1548.12s)]
*  right away. But anyway, they finally realized this. It's very strange coming from, you know, like [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1553.56s)]
*  after they've pushed all the stuff they've pushed over the last 10, 15 years, but just a little [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1561.48s)]
*  piece of advice, maybe you don't project like alpha male energy or like dominant male energy [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1567.56s)]
*  by saying, I am now going to project dominant male energy. You have to just do it. You can't sit there [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1577.96s)]
*  and say, it's too like, I think I could kick their ass. Like now, see now this just comes off as like, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1586.1200000000001s)]
*  like you're a try hard or something like that. It's like, no, that's not actually it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1591.96s)]
*  You could win a dance off. Quite possibly. Honestly, I'm, don't feel that comfortable with [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1596.68s)]
*  this toxic masculinity being exhibited by him. It really, I mean, the fact that he'll threaten [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1603.0s)]
*  physical violence to try and solve political problems. I mean, what happened to tampons to [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1608.28s)]
*  boys? I thought that's what we were about. I mean, really, it's just very, it's just going [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1613.08s)]
*  to be very difficult for Democrats to transition, no pun intended, from all of the stuff they've [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1617.8799999999999s)]
*  been talking about to this now. Like we're going to be alpha men or something. I don't know. I just [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1625.8799999999999s)]
*  find this, but it is interesting to me that they've at least recognized that they've realized like, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1631.6399999999999s)]
*  oh, there's a problem here that we don't, it's not, and part of it is just looking at the numbers. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1636.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, they are just hemorrhaging men, you know, and it's a lot more than the fact that it was [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1642.04s)]
*  Kamala Harris, like was that it was a woman running for president this year. It was true. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1649.6399999999999s)]
*  According to the polls under Joe Biden as well. And I think it would have been true if Joe Biden [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1654.12s)]
*  had run or just about any Democrat had run. It's like men across all age groups, across all [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1658.92s)]
*  ethnicities and races and, and you know, like men have just walked away from Democrats. And it's [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1665.72s)]
*  for such obvious reasons. I mean, it's just not, it's not a, an environment where any man is going [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1673.96s)]
*  to feel comfortable, or at least any like traditionally masculine man is just not going [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1682.76s)]
*  to feel comfortable there. It's everything. Everything is about feelings and you know, about [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1688.3600000000001s)]
*  kind of, I don't know, like safety over adventurism, like everything is just, there's [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1694.44s)]
*  just something like, even in the policies that I just like adamantly disagree with Donald Trump [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1703.16s)]
*  about, there's always something masculine to them. There's always something, you know, we're going [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1707.72s)]
*  to take Greenland or whatever, you know, it's like, there's something there. And they've, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1712.04s)]
*  they've openly been talking about toxic masculinity for years and lecturing young boys and let, you [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1717.72s)]
*  know, it's just, it's, it's been a disaster for them. So they recognize that to some degree, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1723.48s)]
*  like we got to win these men back over, but then just sitting here again, I know I've used this [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1728.28s)]
*  example before, but it's just like, when I hear Tim Walz talking about how he could kick anyone's [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1733.08s)]
*  ass, it just, to me, it sounds, it's like that scene in the 40 year old Virgin when he's describing [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1737.88s)]
*  what a boob feels like. Like, it's just like, I know you're saying the thing that you think is [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1745.16s)]
*  the thing to say now, but you clearly have no experience in this department at all. All right, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1751.64s)]
*  let's keep playing. Actually, actually, I think it's one of the reasons we're losing so many men. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1757.0800000000002s)]
*  And again, it's multi-ethnic. It's not just white men. We're losing them. We're losing them to these [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1764.6000000000001s)]
*  guys online. We're losing them people that I'm bringing on this podcast as well. That's why I [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1769.4s)]
*  brought these are bad guys, though. These are bad guys, but they exist and we could deny they exist. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1773.0800000000002s)]
*  Not only they exist, they persist and they're actually influencing young kids every single day. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1779.56s)]
*  How do we push some of those guys back under a rock? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1784.6s)]
*  I think we have to first understand what their motivations are. I think we have to understand [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1787.32s)]
*  what they're actually doing. You don't think that's racism and misogyny? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1791.72s)]
*  I think there's a lot of that, but I don't think it's exclusively that. When you talk to a guy like [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1794.84s)]
*  Steve, he talks about work. I mean, this is the part that was like, actually most interesting to me, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1798.28s)]
*  is that the... Because it just shows you it's such a... It's the mentality of the old order. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1805.4s)]
*  This is what Tim Walz's idea. How do we push them back under a rock? How do we take them out? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1816.04s)]
*  This is the mentality that the Democrats have. This is the mentality that [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1823.4s)]
*  the government has had for a very long time. It's like, that's it. Okay, they're a problem, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1828.7600000000002s)]
*  so how do we eliminate them? What's the plan here? Censorship? You know what I mean? What do we do? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1835.0800000000002s)]
*  That's the goal. They're bad people. How do we get rid of them? It's like what Gavin Newsom [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1839.48s)]
*  is a few steps ahead of Walz on this is that he's like... At least he's recognizing like, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1846.3600000000001s)]
*  oh yeah, no, the answer is we can't. The answer is we can't push them back under a rock. We do [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1853.0800000000002s)]
*  not have that ability to do that. It's not even an ideological question. It's a reality-based question. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1859.64s)]
*  Can you do that or can you not? It'd be like, whatever. You're not in a position to do that. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1868.68s)]
*  And then, Gavin Newsom is kind of suggesting like, well, you have to kind of... [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1878.36s)]
*  It's like coming to the most obvious conclusion so many years too late, but he's like, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1885.8799999999999s)]
*  I think maybe you'd have to address their arguments. I think maybe you'd have to deal [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1890.28s)]
*  with their grievances and maybe have a response to some of the points that they make. And Tim Walz [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1895.0s)]
*  is like, but they're racists and sexists. It's like, wait, they're racists and sexists. They [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1901.8s)]
*  go under the rock. Listen, that did work for a remarkably long period of time. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1907.56s)]
*  I don't think it's working anymore. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1916.44s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. What do you think, Rob? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1980.28s)]
*  I agree with everything you just said. That was the most interesting part of it because [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1983.8000000000002s)]
*  Tim Walz is literally saying, hey, what happens to the old playbook where we call these people [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1987.24s)]
*  mean people and then we censor them and then we don't contend with any of their ideas? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1992.6000000000001s)]
*  And Gavin Newsom is actually contending with reality, which the Democrats are particularly [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=1997.4s)]
*  not good at, which is why they'll tell you that we're winning the Ukraine war, which will why they [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2002.76s)]
*  will tell you that it's better for your health to not go to work, not have your kids in school, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2007.96s)]
*  and not to see your loved ones and to wear masks. Because Democrats, they like to take a narrative, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2012.44s)]
*  pick the narrative and then shame you if you don't agree with him. And they did that for [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2017.96s)]
*  how many years? That was the last 10 years was shaming everyone that didn't agree with their [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2023.0s)]
*  opinion and then censoring them and trying to pretend like you were an evil person if you [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2028.04s)]
*  didn't go with the democratic narrative. And so that's all Tim Walz knows. And he's sitting here [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2031.3200000000002s)]
*  and he's going Newsom. You're not playing by the book. You're actually giving these people [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2035.8s)]
*  their day to share their opinion. You're legitimizing them. We got to do everything [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2039.72s)]
*  that we can to push them back under the rock. But Newsom, like I said, he's actually better at sales [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2043.16s)]
*  and he knows he got to answer the phone. You can't fear it. And so we have to actually have these [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2049.0s)]
*  conversations. And if you've ever seen two people auditioning to try and be a part of the next [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2053.64s)]
*  election, I mean, Newsom is clearly more favorable than Tim Walz, who's trying to pull the Kamala [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2057.96s)]
*  Harris playbook of, well, I'll just preach that the other people are evil. Yeah, that didn't work. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2064.92s)]
*  And you're not going to sell that. It doesn't work. Newsom's at least. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2070.12s)]
*  Yes, I agree with you. You know, there's no like conceivable path from where Tim Walz is to being [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2074.04s)]
*  the democratic nominee next time. Because he just, he can't be the VP candidate on such a [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2080.6800000000003s)]
*  spectacular failure of a ticket and then get from there. But even if you could. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2085.96s)]
*  Haven't seen his interpretive dances yet. And well, that is a good boy. That is a good boy. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2091.24s)]
*  Like it's always sunny when what's his name finally comes out of the closet and Frank goes, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2094.92s)]
*  I get it. So, you know, maybe he just hasn't had a moment to express himself and the way he really [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2098.6s)]
*  knows how in a way that would be genuine and the rest of America would go, now I get that guy. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2103.96s)]
*  Well, you do. Well, listen, interpretive dance wild card aside, you do see just the, the, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2109.24s)]
*  the difference in skill and intelligence. And this is what I was kind of saying about Gavin Newsom. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2117.72s)]
*  I mean, it's just like, yes, there's just levels above. But listen, the point you made, and I think [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2123.08s)]
*  we had, I think we, we had an episode recently that was titled like the left versus reality [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2127.08s)]
*  or something like that. And there's no, there is no question about it. And I think there's something [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2132.52s)]
*  at the, like, it's at the very heart of kind of the left right divide, right wing people, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2139.32s)]
*  it's kind of built into their worldview that we, we have constraints due to reality, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2148.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, and that that's something that you have to contend with. You can't just wish that away. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2158.76s)]
*  Whereas the left wing worldview is always kind of built more on a utopian vision. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2163.8s)]
*  egalitarianism in itself is a kind of utopian vision. And like most utopian visions, when put [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2171.2400000000002s)]
*  into practice, they're actually terrifying nightmares. But there is something where it's [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2177.5600000000004s)]
*  right, like, you know, I think the example, the example we were talking about in that episode was, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2182.2000000000003s)]
*  like IQ science. And it's just, it's amazing to see leftist reactions to IQ science being presented [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2187.6400000000003s)]
*  to them. And like, look, it's uncomfortable, but you know, and it's not like the IQ, the best [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2195.0s)]
*  science on IQ tells us things that we would all probably wish weren't the case. You know, like, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2204.6000000000004s)]
*  it would be nicer if the average IQ was the same in every racial group. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2213.96s)]
*  But it's not. And then you it almost like I don't remember getting into this. It's never been like [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2219.96s)]
*  an area that I specialize in or like talk about a lot. But I remember getting into arguments about [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2226.84s)]
*  this with like woke libertarians, you know, like a few years ago, and I got and there's just something [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2231.4s)]
*  interesting about like, and perhaps it's like a personality trait type of thing. But there's [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2237.2400000000002s)]
*  something about like, I find it to be like a maturity test in a lot of ways. But when you come [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2243.4s)]
*  across information that's like, shit, I really wish it wasn't that way. But this is what reality is. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2250.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like a question of how do you deal with that? Do you just stick your head in the sand and pretend [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2257.7200000000003s)]
*  that's not real? You just like, Nope, sorry, that challenges my worldview. And so I'm going to ignore [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2261.88s)]
*  that. Or do you go like, Okay, shit, well, we got to grapple with that. Now, I have to incorporate [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2268.52s)]
*  that into my, you know, view of things. And the look, I mean, you know, you gave a good example of [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2273.0s)]
*  the we're winning the war in Ukraine. But even like, I got to say all that the transgender stuff, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2280.28s)]
*  I mean, it's like the most obvious test of all of this. And again, that doesn't mean you have to say, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2287.16s)]
*  like, there is a way in which you could be an advocate for transgender people, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2293.64s)]
*  and still come to terms with reality. Right? Like you, you could sit here and be like, Hey, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2301.64s)]
*  man, like adults should be allowed to live their life however they want to. Even if you're making [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2306.7599999999998s)]
*  the argument for children, you know, you could make that argument, I don't agree with that. But [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2312.12s)]
*  you could make the argument that it's like, ah, people are better if they're allowed to live their [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2315.48s)]
*  lives in these ways. But to leftist so often, it's not just that. They also then have to just deny the [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2319.56s)]
*  reality of it. trans women are women. If you're like, Oh, that's not a biological male. You're a [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2328.68s)]
*  bigot. You're a horrible person. It's like, wait, what? Like, it's just, there's such a mental [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2334.7599999999998s)]
*  forget even how you feel about trans any transition, forget how you feel about that. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2340.2s)]
*  I'm just saying, there's a difference between people who just recognize what's in our control [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2346.2799999999997s)]
*  and what's out of our control. What is real? Like, what is real is that like you were [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2351.08s)]
*  biologically born a sex, and you don't get to change that any more than you get to change [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2356.84s)]
*  your species. You can pretend like you can do it, but like you're not actually doing it. It's [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2362.1200000000003s)]
*  just so obvious. And anyway, there is just something about that, that like the inability [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2367.48s)]
*  to deal with reality. And what you're what you're seeing here, as you put it, is that at least Gavin [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2375.48s)]
*  Newsom is attempting, he's at least attempting to like, let me try. Okay, let's just play the last [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2380.04s)]
*  couple moments of this. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2387.32s)]
*  Working folks, and he talks about how we hollowed out the industry for this country. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2389.08s)]
*  But he didn't understand that. But so we can dismiss the notion of election denialism, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2394.44s)]
*  we could completely dismiss what he did on January six. But I don't think you can dismiss [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2399.96s)]
*  what he's saying reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, remind me a lot of what [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2405.16s)]
*  Democrats said 20, 30 years ago. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2408.76s)]
*  All right. So anyway, they're at the final, but I mean, you really do just see how like, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2413.0s)]
*  how helpless Tim Walz is to in this conversation, that he goes, he goes, you know, Steve Bannon's [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2418.1200000000003s)]
*  coming here, and however you feel about him, he's got like a pitch to the working class. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2423.96s)]
*  And he's got an argument for how the government has betrayed them and what the plan is to get, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2428.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, things back for them. And he goes, but he denied the election. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2432.76s)]
*  Like he's just he can't get out of this like old box. Like you're trapped in this old world. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2436.6s)]
*  And that is over, dude. Like that's just not how it works anymore. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2442.84s)]
*  It's, it's, it's, to me, very interesting to watch who can who can adapt and who can't. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2448.2s)]
*  That really is what it all comes down to. Any any final thoughts on Gavin Newsom's podcast [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2456.84s)]
*  there or any of the stuff, Rob? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2462.68s)]
*  I like that he's doing it because as all of the joy reads and everyone else gets [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2464.6000000000004s)]
*  clean out of cable media, at least we got a new person to get some clips from and criticize. So [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2468.76s)]
*  lucky for us, there'll be more people spewing absolute nonsense on new platforms and we'll [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2475.1600000000003s)]
*  be able to tackle it. Yeah. Well, look, I mean, I try it's a weird feeling almost in a way. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2480.44s)]
*  I don't think we've ever really been quite here before, but I am more hesitant than ever. Like [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2486.84s)]
*  when I'm finding clips, I'll see all the time just someone on CNN or someone on MSNBC saying [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2493.4s)]
*  the most retarded thing ever. Then it almost it's gotten to a point where it does. It starts to feel [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2498.6800000000003s)]
*  beneath this show to be debunking that. It's like, what am I, you know, like, what am I even doing? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2504.36s)]
*  No one's watching it. Maybe you got to get on Newsom's show and take a soul. Just take them [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2511.1600000000003s)]
*  out of the race. Maybe that can be the next trophy for for the Dave Smith soul collection. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2514.92s)]
*  Dude, I'd do that anytime. I'm not sure he would, but I would I would do I would do Gavin Newsom's [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2521.48s)]
*  podcast in a heartbeat. I would love it. And he had he did have Charlie Kirk on. That's true. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2527.2400000000002s)]
*  I do think that Charlie Kirk and I'm not saying anything bad about Charlie. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2533.48s)]
*  Because I like him and he's he's been cool to me and I've done his show a couple times and I [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2539.0s)]
*  enjoy doing it. I think he's a smart guy. Like I respect him. I do think that, you know, there was [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2544.44s)]
*  a I really appreciated this. I took it as a compliment, although it wasn't exactly a [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2550.12s)]
*  compliment. But I also did think there was something that was kind of inaccurate assessment. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2555.72s)]
*  So Patchbit David, I think I'm almost 99 percent sure it was Patchbit David was on Tucker Carlson's [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2560.7599999999998s)]
*  podcast and it was ahead of the Cuomo debate. Like the debate had been announced, but we hadn't done [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2568.2799999999997s)]
*  it yet. And I think that was the topic that came up. But I came up and I think Pat asked Tucker [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2575.0s)]
*  something like, oh, how do you think that's going to go or how do you think? And Tucker said he goes, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2585.08s)]
*  the thing about Dave is that he's totally unencumbered. Like there aren't he doesn't [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2590.6s)]
*  have anything that he's not allowed to say. You know, like there's no and I think what he was [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2599.08s)]
*  just getting at is that there's no I'm kind of in a unique position where I like I make my money [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2604.36s)]
*  from the podcast and from touring on the road. There is no donor. There is no like I mean, I have [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2612.84s)]
*  we have sponsors on the show, but there's like zero pressure that comes from the sponsors we have. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2624.84s)]
*  And you know this, you know, as well as anyone, Rob, because you know, for years were working with [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2630.12s)]
*  some of these sponsors. But there's nobody there's there's not it is. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2635.72s)]
*  And literally, as I'm talking to you and Natalie or the people on my team here on the show, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2641.64s)]
*  you know this, it's inconceivable that one of our sponsors would put pressure on us over the [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2646.52s)]
*  content of our show and that that would have any results other than, oh, OK, go fuck yourself. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2652.92s)]
*  You're not a sponsor on my show anymore. There's just no there's no like this is the idea that [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2658.12s)]
*  like, you know, like crowd health is going to jump on me and be like, hey, Dave, you know, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2663.4s)]
*  this thing you said, first off, most people like crowd health. Most of them are on board. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2667.88s)]
*  And this great company, by the way, but they're on board because they like what we do. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2671.88s)]
*  Like this, you know what I mean? Like it's so and I think when Tucker said that there was something [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2675.0s)]
*  about that that hit home with me, like I don't have I have no concern about like the billionaire [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2679.0s)]
*  that I have to meet with next month and whether we're going to get our check to keep going for [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2687.0s)]
*  the next year. This is just something that happens. It's the nature of not government. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2691.24s)]
*  It's the nature of just like the world when you get an entity that's as large as like [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2695.96s)]
*  Turning Point USA or something like that. And so I don't. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2700.36s)]
*  In other words, what you know, I'm not going to the cocktail parties. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2705.48s)]
*  I don't go to any cocktail parties. I don't even go to the gas digital parties. I would love [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2710.28s)]
*  probably to do those. But I just got little kids. I'm busy. But like I just I don't there's nothing [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2714.6s)]
*  that would be taken away from me if I crossed this line. It's like whatever. I'm just in a unique [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2721.3199999999997s)]
*  position where I just get to tell the truth. And I've kind of built my career to be that way [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2727.88s)]
*  because that's what I like to do. And so there is just it's a it's a safer proposition for Gavin [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2731.16s)]
*  Newsom to have Charlie Kirk on than it would be to have me on. Like there's just if you [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2740.84s)]
*  I mean if I you know it it would be like Chris Cuomo, you know, like it's to me there's and [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2748.92s)]
*  even though I'd probably you know like the war and peace is probably like my number one issue [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2755.88s)]
*  that I care about the most like lockdown. No one's I'm not I'm more furious at lockdown [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2761.88s)]
*  governors than I am at anybody else. And there'd be you know the truth is me saying this out loud [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2768.12s)]
*  probably guarantees that I'll never be on the show. But it's a long shot anyway. So I don't care. But [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2774.12s)]
*  I'd go in with the mentality I went in with Cuomo like I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking ruin you. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2779.08s)]
*  Not just like I mean I guess I can't like ruin you exactly. But this will be an albatross around [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2785.3199999999997s)]
*  your neck for the rest of your public days. Like this will be something that it's like ah but [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2790.2s)]
*  remember when that guy took your fucking soul is you know like that's that's what it would be. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2794.12s)]
*  And I don't think Charlie Kirk went in with that attitude. You know what I'm saying? Like it's just [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2799.7999999999997s)]
*  a different I'm a different animal in that way. And that's not to say I'm better or smarter or [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2803.7999999999997s)]
*  anything like that. It's just we're we're different people in different positions and we have different [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2809.96s)]
*  styles. So anyway I don't think that's going to happen. But man I would do that in a second. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2815.72s)]
*  Man would I love to do that. Okay so the other thing by the way is speaking of so what I will [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2820.04s)]
*  find for the shows now is like okay so like this like again okay so Joy Reid is gone but like [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2824.2s)]
*  whoever the next stupid lady at MSNBC is I'm finding it I'm having a tougher and tougher time [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2830.2s)]
*  justifying like playing a clip of them because you're just like no one watched this no one takes [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2835.64s)]
*  this seriously. It's kind of low-hanging fruit. But when Gavin Newsom is now starting a podcast [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2840.44s)]
*  and looks like the 2028 front runner that's worth you know what I mean like taking on. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2847.08s)]
*  Likewise to set up this next clip when the most powerful Democrat in the Senate is going on the [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2852.44s)]
*  view I still think that's legitimate to a legitimate target because this is somebody with [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2858.36s)]
*  actual political power and he is kind of the de facto leader or the co-leader I guess it's [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2864.12s)]
*  him and Nancy Pelosi are still kind of the leaders of the Democratic Party which is [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2871.24s)]
*  remarkable in a sense. It's really and I know this is a point that you've made many times Rob [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2876.68s)]
*  but it's really something about DC where like in almost any other area of life you simply cannot [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2881.72s)]
*  fail as catastrophically as Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi have failed and just continue on. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2893.8s)]
*  Like I mean like there's no company where there wouldn't be a shake-up no matter how high up it [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2900.76s)]
*  is. I mean this could be the CEO or the CFO of a company if they failed this spectacular we're [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2906.6s)]
*  looking for a new CEO you know like that's it. In a marriage if you fail this spectacularly [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2911.56s)]
*  it ends in divorce. I mean there's just nothing in life where there aren't some repercussions [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2918.52s)]
*  except for in DC where you can just fail and fail and fail and fail and you know you could [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2924.76s)]
*  and then still be outraged if anyone suggests you leave. It's still be what do you mean you're [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2930.1200000000003s)]
*  going to cut the Department of Education? What? Like Department of Education? What? Like we spend [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2934.92s)]
*  so much goddamn money on education and our kids can't read and they're like still you can't cut [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2940.28s)]
*  us. Anyway all right guys let's take a moment to thank our sponsor Monetary Metals an amazing [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2945.5600000000004s)]
*  company that I've been telling you guys about for a while now you really got to check them out. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2951.48s)]
*  If you own gold you've probably been pretty happy to see prices hitting an all-time high [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2955.8s)]
*  last year but your gold can do more than just sit there waiting for the price to go up it can also [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2960.84s)]

*  double-digit returns in their bond offerings. All interest payments are made in ounces of gold and [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2977.72s)]
*  silver stored in your account free of charge. So you just think about this a lot of people own gold [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2983.3999999999996s)]
*  and silver for a variety of reasons but oftentimes people own this I think most of the time people [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2989.3999999999996s)]
*  own it and they're being charged storage fees for it and they're not earning anything off it and now [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=2996.8399999999997s)]
*  with Monetary Metals not only are you earning off of your precious metals but you're earning [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3001.7999999999997s)]

*  Murphy and Brian Schatz we have you know Democrats are learning to do the digital social media much [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3048.36s)]
*  better than we did before I put Cory Booker and Tina Smith in charge and then we have Bernie going [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3055.32s)]
*  out to Republican areas and doing rallies and rallying so we have a load of talent in our caucus [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3061.4s)]
*  and I'll tell you one thing we are totally united in one already pause it already because and then [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3067.7200000000003s)]
*  just go back a little bit because I want to get that next statement in there but dude to just say [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3073.0s)]
*  I have a load of talent and then to rattle off the most pathetic list of names I mean it's just like [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3079.8s)]
*  talk about not contending with reality oh yeah you've got we've so much talent I mean we could [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3088.04s)]
*  throw Cory Booker at him if we needed to Cory Booker dude what did that guy get when he ran [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3093.16s)]
*  for president anything was he at one was he at one percent in the polls it's uh it's worse than [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3099.64s)]
*  that I mean I've said it that the Democrats uh listen we'll see they might uh do all right [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3107.48s)]
*  depending on how bad Trump does uh but at the moment they have nobody on their bench and the [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3112.92s)]
*  fact that they have Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders trying to be out there selling the [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3117.8s)]
*  Democratic message just speaks to currently how doomed they are but when you start talking about [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3122.12s)]
*  their social media presence and we played some of the horrific clips that they had over the last [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3127.56s)]
*  couple weeks Cory Booker had a particularly bad one where he wrote that script where everyone [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3131.64s)]
*  here's the thing like they're trying for all the talk that they did of Donald Trump and the dignity [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3137.08s)]
*  of the office now they're trying to be cool and like throwing curse words but it just doesn't [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3140.68s)]
*  match their style and it doesn't fit for them and also the internet has picked up on oh everyone's [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3144.9199999999996s)]
*  reading the exact same script what is this uh and so it was something I think the line was like that [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3149.56s)]
*  shit just won't stand or something just uh it was not good and Cory Booker had to come forward [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3154.6s)]
*  afterwards and go yeah I wrote that and so the fact that that's the name being thrown out there [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3159.96s)]
*  right now of oh I got this guy and he's running our social media strategy talk about not adapting [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3164.44s)]
*  of that you can't find a single marketing company with the millions I mean the fact that uh I guess [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3170.04s)]
*  it speaks to the hundred what was it uh 1.2 billion dollars that Kamala Harris spent not [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3175.32s)]
*  being re-elected and how much the marketing companies failed her in trying to put together [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3181.0s)]
*  a strategy and what she paid to digital marketing companies but to sit here right now right after [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3184.68s)]
*  Cory Booker had a big swing and a miss and go don't worry our bench is doing okay we're getting [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3189.48s)]
*  we're gonna the social media thing that the kids like and I've got Cory Booker working on it [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3194.44s)]
*  just sounds like such a it's like the guy trying to flip a burger that's got a piece of cheese on [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3199.32s)]
*  it in the oven's not on you don't you do not know how to do this yeah there's uh look this is an [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3202.92s)]
*  element to it that it's like you just it's like it's not as simple as like we've got to be on [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3208.84s)]
*  social media because it's like you could go viral on social media in a bad way you know what I mean [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3215.48s)]
*  like there's there's a difference between going viral and something that's that's helpful and [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3222.44s)]
*  something that's disastrous you know like um like you know Kamala Harris had a ton of things that [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3226.68s)]
*  went viral during the election when she said on the view that she couldn't think of anything that [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3232.2799999999997s)]
*  she would have done differently than Joe Biden that went viral it also destroyed any chance she [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3238.3599999999997s)]
*  had if she had any chance of winning the election um and it just it gives off it's such um it just [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3243.64s)]
*  gives off such imposter energy like it's it's like oh you're you know say what you will about [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3251.24s)]
*  Donald Trump but he was always being Donald Trump it wasn't like there was some other Donald Trump [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3259.8799999999997s)]
*  and he was trying to be just like that and you know there is it's like they're going and and [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3266.52s)]
*  doing things that are like they'll be doing like an internet viral trend but it was like a trend [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3273.3999999999996s)]
*  three years ago and then they come out and do it and you're like I don't know that's all wrong [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3280.84s)]
*  like that's not how this works so yes anyway it is it is just delusional I mean maybe this is just [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3285.32s)]
*  what he has to say and he knows the truth but it is delusional to be like we have this strong bench [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3291.2400000000002s)]
*  and they're really connecting with social media and all this shit the truth is that even you know [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3296.1200000000003s)]
*  even amongst things like like okay there's that call her daddy podcast and I don't know exactly [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3302.44s)]
*  you know I literally I saw some of the episode of Kamala Harris I've never watched that podcast [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3308.04s)]
*  before I don't really think it's for me um but from what I understand it does get a lot of views [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3312.2799999999997s)]
*  and so it's like it's a big show but even amongst people who watch that show [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3317.48s)]
*  it's not necessarily moving the needle that Kamala Harris went on it you know and something like say [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3324.2799999999997s)]
*  for example like Taylor Swift is undeniably huge you know she's the biggest like uh musician I think [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3330.12s)]
*  ever I think she I think her last tour was like the biggest tour in history um but her telling [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3336.76s)]
*  people to vote for Kamala Harris didn't move the needle at all and so it's like there's the truth [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3343.88s)]
*  is that the Democrats are just you kind of can't overstate it they're getting annihilated in the [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3350.76s)]
*  podcast social media game just and just destroy so for him to sit here and say ah we've gotten [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3359.5600000000004s)]
*  better and we got Cory books out there doing it's like yeah come on dude this is total bullshit [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3365.64s)]
*  all right let's uh let's play the uh some more rally so we have a load of talent in our caucus [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3370.92s)]
*  and I'll tell you one thing we are totally united in one thing many things but one thing above all [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3378.3599999999997s)]
*  we are united in going after Trump and showing the American people that he is making the middle [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3384.68s)]
*  class pay for the tax cuts on the rich right today we're doing it on Medicaid you know we're [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3391.24s)]
*  good yeah let's pause it the fact that you would take your entire party to just unite um to [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3396.6s)]
*  undermine another person that's not a very good message how about united on trying to make a [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3402.3599999999997s)]
*  better life for the working class and so there's it it's just the wrong message you're not supposed [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3408.12s)]
*  to be in front of us talking about the team sport aspect and we're just here to undermine that guy [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3413.64s)]
*  it's it's so stupid and and yes okay he could he did kind of tie it to like going after Trump and [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3418.92s)]
*  then it almost seemed like he felt that he needed to say and how he's making the middle class pay [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3426.76s)]
*  for the tax cuts or something like that but like it is so stupid I mean it's so opposite like [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3431.8s)]
*  like he the the move is that we're all united to make life better for the working class to make [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3440.44s)]
*  life better for middle class Americans to make like that's what you're united in or even even [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3449.96s)]
*  united in something like to get free health care or to get you know whatever something that makes [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3455.96s)]
*  people's lives materially better to be we're all united like in opposing Donald Trump [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3461.56s)]
*  what first of all yeah we know that's not new that's the thing that got you here like what [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3468.92s)]
*  what is that obviously you all oppose Donald Trump but like for your whole thing it does just come [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3478.6000000000004s)]
*  off which is the truth which is like undeniably the truth and this again as we we mentioned was [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3485.56s)]
*  one of the most powerful and it was a rhetorical trick but it was one of the most powerful moments [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3492.1200000000003s)]
*  of Donald Trump's state of the union speech which was very well received by the American people [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3497.56s)]
*  but his most part where he goes I could do anything and these guys are gonna book you know and when [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3502.44s)]
*  you take on first of all he's pointing that out it's also undeniably true that people just hate [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3507.64s)]
*  Donald Trump so much that they're going to oppose him the people who hate him are going to oppose [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3515.0s)]
*  him no matter what he does but for Chuck Schumer to actually say that it's like oh so now you're [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3518.2799999999997s)]
*  putting yourself in a position where we're playing politics and like you said team sports [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3523.24s)]
*  and so what we're just going to oppose Donald Trump even if he does something that's good for [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3529.0s)]
*  the country now in terms of the substance I mean I guess he's about to get into it so we can with [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3533.08s)]
*  you know what I'll save that and then we could respond to this but in terms of the argument here [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3539.8799999999997s)]
*  he's laying out is that the middle class are going to have to pay for the tax cuts for the rich again [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3543.3199999999997s)]
*  just the same old message I mean it's it's unbelievable like it's [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3548.36s)]
*  could you like tell me any scenario in life where you have a catastrophic failure whether that would [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3553.48s)]
*  be professionally or personally romantically whatever you have a catastrophic failure and [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3560.92s)]
*  then as a result of that you go I think what we should do is continue doing all of the same things [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3567.32s)]
*  like when does that ever make sense and this message of like you know you want tax breaks [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3574.44s)]
*  for the rich and the middle class will have to pay that the rich should pay their fair share type [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3581.48s)]
*  shit is like this is the same is the same exact thing you guys always say this is the new thing [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3585.56s)]
*  we're united in our opposition to Donald Trump and the rich should pay their fair share [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3592.2s)]
*  all right way to deal with the situation you're facing all right let's just play the [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3597.96s)]
*  the next little bit and we'll break that down and then we'll wrap you're going to do it very [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3602.28s)]
*  soon on the tariffs he wants to put these tariffs in it's going to raise you folks the average [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3606.1200000000003s)]
*  family 22 000 a year for these tariffs why is he doing that something so stupid why he wants to [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3611.2400000000002s)]
*  use that money for tax cuts for the billionaires the republican party is a different kettle of [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3618.1200000000003s)]

*  now that we didn't invent you know what i mean like there's always like we we always stand on [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3754.76s)]

*  yeah well it's also the other thing too is that this this idea that you know this has just been [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3843.4s)]
*  true for a long period of time it's uh it's when he you know this this talk about tax cuts for [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3849.0s)]
*  billionaires it's all just made up nonsense it's all fucking nonsense is that billionaires don't [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3857.72s)]

*  there were many years where warren buffett didn't have a salary i think a lot of the richest people [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3878.28s)]

*  this idea that the democrats like to like you know because if you say it like that [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3952.2s)]
*  like the way it really is the way it works then you're more likely to be like oh [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMbvgJWl04&t=3956.44s)]
