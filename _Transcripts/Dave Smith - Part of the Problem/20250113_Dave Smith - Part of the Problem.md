*  Tampa a lot of stuff coming up [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=119.28s)]
*  This year so a lot to be excited about what? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=121.64s)]
*  Missing from our list of places so far is Los Angeles. We have no dates there [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=125.24s)]
*  I'm gonna I think we want to figure out what's going on with this situation before we go back. You know I was saying [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=131.32s)]
*  I don't know did I talk about this on the members only episode a little bit possibly, but so I do weirdly because [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=138.4s)]
*  You know LA and New York were always for many years like the two centers of stand-up comedy [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=146.68s)]
*  Those those were the capitals of stand-up comedy with everything else being like it was always [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=153.32s)]
*  Like UFC and pride back in the day or something like that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=159.76s)]
*  It's there's these two, you know, it was like the LA comedy scene in the New York comedy scene [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=163.0s)]
*  They could debate which one was the best but everything else was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=167.66s)]
*  Objectively the second tier. There's comedy scenes around the country, but it was always New York and LA were the top two ones now [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=171.8s)]
*  that's changed a little bit post pandemic and rise of the internet and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=178.8s)]
*  Austin became like a major one. So it's a little different now, but [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  Just because of that like I know a lot of people in LA [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=187.56s)]
*  I just know a lot of people who live out there [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  I know a lot of people who have been affected by these fires [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  The thing is that all of the comedians in LA got so goddamn successful [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  everyone I know who's been affected by this is like a multimillionaire and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  Like that still sucks [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=209.44s)]
*  It sucks to have your house burned down or if they have to evacuate your house [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  It's really hard to sell to the general public that you better feel bad for this person worth 50 million dollars [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=216.36s)]
*  That just kind of sucks all the people in LA with the biggest microphones are worth tens of millions of dollars [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=223.36s)]
*  And so all anyone's seeing is a bunch of rich people crying about their stuff [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  Which is sad, but it doesn't move the needle [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=234.60000000000002s)]
*  You need poor people crying. You want to really get you want to really move the needle here? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=238.24s)]
*  We need to see some pores which there are plenty of but nobody wants to hear from them anyway [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=242.68s)]
*  I don't I mean, I don't know if you have any hot takes on the LA fires [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  I will say look I have [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=255.36s)]
*  Zero like [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=259.2s)]
*  deep knowledge about any of the underlying issues of what led to these fires like I [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=261.36s)]
*  Know about as much as Donald Trump knows and I don't want to sound like him [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=267.88s)]
*  I go Rob [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=271.52s)]
*  There's all these leaves and they got a rake them [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=272.68s)]
*  They got a rake the leaves, but they didn't rake the leaves because they're a bunch of Democrats and Democrats don't rake leaves [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=274.44s)]
*  But it it does seem like a pretty blatant enormous failure of government [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=280.56s)]
*  We could get into some of this stuff a little bit. I I will say it is I was laying the other night [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=287.0s)]
*  I was putting my son to bed [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=293.04s)]
*  He's three and he makes me lay on the floor just like my daughter did at that age [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  It makes me lay on the floor next to him like he's in his bed [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=300.6s)]
*  And I have to lay down on the floor until he falls asleep [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=303.72s)]
*  And then I can crawl out of a room in my own house is that's what it is to be a grown man with children [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  But so I'm sitting there on the floor and I just like have one earbud in so I can't really do nothing [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  But like listen to something on my phone, you know [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  But so I was just going through [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  The the clips of all the different like officials in California and I understand there's a tragic situation [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=322.96s)]
*  I feel that I know I'm sure we have listeners who are out in LA if anybody's affected by this [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=329.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. You have to go through that. It's horrible [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=333.56s)]
*  But listening to first of all, everyone's a lesbian [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=336.24s)]
*  It's like lesbian all the way up to Gavin Newsom. I have nothing against lesbians our producer Natalie here dabbles [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  I have no problem with them. I don't know if fire safety is necessarily they're calling but [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=346.86s)]
*  Whatever [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=352.08s)]
*  But it's just every and every one of them is just scrambling to throw the other one under the bus [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  It's truly unbelievable [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=359.0s)]
*  Like they talked to what this one woman who's like on the fire department and they're kind of like what do you do? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=360.8s)]
*  And these fires aren't golfing everything and she's like, hey listen if we get to the fire hydrant and there's no water there [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=365.58s)]
*  That's not our problem. We don't do the water [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=371.2s)]
*  You got to talk to the water department about that and then the water department's like you got to talk to the Indians about that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=373.64s)]
*  I mean we had all the water but the Indians that that it all it makes its way up to Gavin Newsom [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=378.68s)]
*  but he's finally just like I think it's climate change and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump's misinformation or something like that is just they're all struggling to blame everything they can [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=386.84s)]
*  when the basic reality seems pretty clear Rob, which is like that the biggest state government in [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=392.24s)]
*  the United States of America, you know, so like [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=399.56s)]
*  The United States of America's federal government is the biggest government in the history of the world [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=403.47999999999996s)]
*  California has the biggest state government it within the United States [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=408.23999999999995s)]
*  Los Angeles is the biggest city within that state, right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=413.84s)]
*  And so even when you have a government, I mean the the government of California spends more than many nations do every single year and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=417.67999999999995s)]
*  Yet still they can't complete the most basic services and I think there actually seems to be a relationship there [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=426.28s)]
*  Where the larger government grows the more the most basic [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=433.04s)]
*  services that we would all assume would just be the things government would take care of like say a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=437.8s)]
*  Fire, you know the fire department or something like that their services like just fall off a cliff [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=442.92s)]
*  Anyway, I want to play this clip from Gavin Newsom, but any thoughts on any of this stuff Rob [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=450.92s)]
*  Yeah, the government they're the abusive boyfriend and part of their pitch is hey, baby in an emergency [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=455.24s)]
*  I'm gonna be here for you. Yeah, you're not good for planning for yourself [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=461.4s)]
*  So let me have all the money because I'm better at preparing for emergencies and I'm gonna take care of you, baby [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=465.2s)]
*  And then the second you have an emergency the abusive boyfriend who doesn't have a job. Yeah, you know doesn't [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=471.64s)]
*  Let me manage the finances [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm better with the money than you are and if I have the money then I'll make sure that you got the health care and if [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  There's ever ever an emergency. I'm gonna stash this that we're ready for an emergency and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=486.0s)]
*  I mean if you're a [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=490.84000000000003s)]
*  Person who was living in a 30 million dollar house and you didn't trust the government to build your kitchen [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  You didn't trust the government to do your plumbing [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=498.12s)]
*  You didn't trust the government to have the water in your sinks and now all of a sudden you're dealing with [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=499.8s)]
*  Rationing because government doesn't actually have the resources for the fire department. You must start rethinking [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=504.84000000000003s)]
*  Hey, why was I relying on government for that one? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=510.48s)]
*  Why was one of the most important things in this area of fire prevention? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=513.24s)]
*  Something that I was relying on the government for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=517.44s)]
*  And the the big the big storyline of which I also don't have this fully validated [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=520.32s)]
*  But it's been reported in the New York Post and elsewhere is that a lot of water gets flushed into the ocean and that's apparently [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  To save some some little teeny tiny fish. I don't know why that's important [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  It's been even Gavin Newsom is admitted to the fact that there isn't enough fire [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=537.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean not enough water available [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=541.48s)]
*  For the people that are trying to fight the fires and yes, they've put a lot of money into apparently refilling [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  The reservoirs or whatever supposed to exist for that that would speak to mismanagement [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=551.8s)]
*  Whatever money's been spent not helping the homeless. I mean [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=556.6s)]
*  Huge money spent on the homeless, I mean like it and and without solving the problem [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=563.4s)]
*  You know like without like huge money spent and yet still if you go to San Francisco or you go to Los Angeles [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=568.96s)]
*  Or you go to San Diego or any of this time the homeless are all over the place [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  And so it's and of course it's become this like crazy [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=578.0s)]
*  racket where there's all these people making like five hundred grand six hundred grand a year because they're managing the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  oversight of the homeless, you know plant and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=587.76s)]
*  Nothing, you know, and I will say I do just like as I mentioned before I do just find this to be a major theme [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  That is [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=597.6s)]
*  in many ways it's [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=599.0s)]
*  Fascinating and I think it's it's a human characteristic because all of this is the work of human beings after all but like [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=601.2800000000001s)]
*  We talk about it all the time generally speaking with the United States of America [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=608.6s)]
*  But when you have this, you know, you have this gigantic government that's spending well over six trillion dollars a year [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=613.24s)]
*  Just the biggest most powerful [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=620.6s)]
*  Organization in the history of the world and they're doing all of these things like, you know, they're under Joe Biden [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=623.24s)]
*  You know [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=629.16s)]
*  They're trying to set up a Ministry of Truth in the Department of Homeland Security and they're you know, they're they're regulating what big tech companies [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  Can say and they're they're micromanaging colored revolutions in the furthest corners of Eastern Europe and they're deciding whether the regime in [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=637.36s)]
*  Somalia is fit to rule or whether we have to overthrow that regime and whether you know, it'll just [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=645.76s)]
*  Taking on the world and then meanwhile the most basic functions of government [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=651.68s)]
*  You know, we can't protect our borders win our wars balance our budgets [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=657.56s)]
*  You know like the simple things that you would immediately any like Joe six pack would be like well [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=661.8s)]
*  What does government do it would be like? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=668.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know they do the roads and the courts and the cops, you know [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  Like the most basic things you're failing on all of those while you're trying to like, you know [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=673.16s)]
*  Put a man on the moon, you know in I don't mean that literally but [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=678.8199999999999s)]
*  either way in California you have this situation where [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=683.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, the government is demanding that we switch to electric cars and we be build high-speed rail [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=689.02s)]
*  And they're good [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=696.26s)]
*  You know what? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=697.26s)]
*  I mean, it's like the biggest government that wants to micromanage every single issue and then when it comes down to the most basic [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=697.74s)]
*  Functions of government like are your streets clean? Are there people defecating in your streets? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=704.18s)]
*  Are there you know what? I mean in again to your point in Los Angeles [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=709.4599999999999s)]
*  It's not as if these fires were like [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=712.5799999999999s)]
*  Something that came out of the blue that nobody could have foreseen [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=715.78s)]
*  This was the problem that you would be concerned with, you know [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=719.14s)]
*  Like this this should have been at the top of Gavin Newsom's list every single day when he gets to his desk [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=722.9799999999999s)]
*  Every single day when he gets to his desk like this is the dynamic here you're in a desert [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=729.94s)]
*  It's incredibly dry when fires start. They're very difficult to contain [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=735.62s)]
*  and [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=740.74s)]
*  and you know, obviously it's a [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=742.02s)]
*  It's it's just one of those examples where [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=746.58s)]
*  much like with a lot of these things it's like you just [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=749.7s)]
*  I mean, this is obviously the most like blatant example, but [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=753.46s)]
*  You can propagandize people and fool them and stuff, but you can't convince them their city's not on fire when their city's on fire [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=757.38s)]
*  That's just even even regular people can figure that shit out and they certainly seem to have figured this out people are furious [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=764.58s)]
*  Go ahead. That's a level of extreme negligence that you don't have the water [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=772.74s)]
*  I mean if I if I owned a building that had sprinklers [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=777.62s)]
*  For a fire in what's an industrial plant that could very easily set fire and I had advanced sprinkler system [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=781.16s)]
*  And I just didn't attach the water line to it or I skipped on the water line bill or whatever [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=787.8s)]
*  Or I was so stupid that if I had to turn off the electricity in the building, that's not another power source [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=793.3199999999999s)]
*  That's negligence [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=799.0s)]
*  Yeah, it sure it sure does seem like a whoopsie [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=801.0s)]
*  Seems like something you might want to might want to figure out [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=803.72s)]
*  Um here let's play this clip of uh, gavin newsome here because I I do [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=806.6800000000001s)]
*  Perhaps one of the more interesting politics that now is not the time to point out my failures. It never it's it never is [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=812.6s)]
*  Um, this it's so funny, man. It's always that's isn't that always the case though, right? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=819.96s)]
*  Now is never the time to think about how I failed all of you guys and then later also won't be the time [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=824.6s)]
*  But let's get to later and then we'll discuss it [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=830.2s)]
*  I do think one of the most interesting angles on this is like what this ultimately is going to mean. I mean look [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=833.24s)]
*  you [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=839.8s)]
*  You can't ignore the fact that this comes here. Let me sound like kamala harris for a second these fires happened [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=842.12s)]
*  in context [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=849.72s)]
*  And what is that context? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=851.56s)]
*  But it is it is hard to ignore the context of which this is all happening. Okay, you have had [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=854.52s)]
*  obviously the you know the trump winning the election [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=859.8s)]
*  uh the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=865.64s)]
*  Just crashing and burning of joe biden and kamala harris. You have the corporate media in shambles [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=867.16s)]
*  You have wokeism kind of on the retreat in a way that even just a couple of years ago would have seemed like very you know [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=874.04s)]
*  It would have seemed crazy, you know for this to be happening [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=882.92s)]
*  You know for this to be happening in this short a timeline, uh, you have trudeau stepping down now, you know, there's just [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=885.24s)]
*  it's like blow after blow after blow and [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=893.0s)]
*  California is just [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=896.82s)]
*  There's politically speaking. There's almost no way to spin this [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=898.44s)]
*  I mean, yes, donald trump just won the election [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=901.5600000000001s)]
*  But joe biden is president of the united states of america gavin newsome is the you know [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=903.64s)]
*  It's the president the governor the mayor the the head of the fire department [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=909.16s)]
*  I mean it's democrats all the way up and down like there are no republican fingerprints on this [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=914.2s)]
*  That's not at all to say that republicans if in power may not have mismanaged things in a in a similar fashion and there have been [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=920.04s)]
*  uh republican areas where things were very mismanaged, you know, you can think of uh, texas and the uh, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=927.08s)]
*  The ice storm thing that they had there [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=932.28s)]
*  But that was a little bit different because it's like well texas never gets weather like this [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=934.92s)]
*  Fires in california aren't some crazy thing that this never happens. But regardless in this example [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=940.12s)]
*  It's just democrats all the way up and down and the incompetence just like is so obvious the optics of this are just all so [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=946.12s)]
*  Terrible that I do wonder if gavin newsome can survive this [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=953.62s)]
*  Um, i'm not i'm not sure about that. So we will see [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=958.4399999999999s)]
*  Um, anyway, let's uh, did you want to add something or you want to go to the i'm gonna guess that this has to be the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=962.8399999999999s)]
*  End of his career [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=968.12s)]
*  I think that this is just uh [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=969.56s)]
*  There's nothing hidden. It's not happening underground. It's not a fiscal policy that will result in failure down the line [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=972.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not a couple people that aren't getting the health care that they need [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=978.76s)]
*  Uh, you your job your example in the example that you just used right? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=982.04s)]
*  It's like if some some chick has like an abusive boyfriend who doesn't work and just kind of lives off of her [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=987.1600000000001s)]
*  But like the promise is oh, but i'll protect you or something like that [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=993.96s)]
*  And then some other guy comes up and just mugs her right in front of this boyfriend and he does nothing [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=997.08s)]
*  You're like, oh but dude that was your claim like that you had to do that [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  You bring nothing else to the table, you know like for for government to not be able to do the most basic [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1008.44s)]
*  fundamental duty of [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1016.18s)]
*  Government or what's viewed as the most basic fundamental duty of government? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1018.2s)]
*  It's a very tough thing to survive for like you can't protect me from fires that might come [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1021.88s)]
*  Jesus, you can't make sure that the fire department has water [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1027.08s)]
*  Uh, that's tough. Um, all right, let's let's play the interview and then I think there'll be some stuff here to to discuss [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1030.84s)]
*  I want to know the answers. So i'm the governor of california want to know the answer [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1037.88s)]
*  I've got that question. I can't tell you about how many people what happened [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1041.4s)]
*  My own team saying what happened and I want to get the answers and I wasn't getting happy can't [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1045.0s)]
*  I wasn't getting straight answers. Yeah, I watched the press conference. I met with some of those leaders [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1048.36s)]
*  We had my team start talking to local leaders saying what's going on our state? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1052.92s)]
*  We're getting straight answers. I was getting different answers [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1056.52s)]
*  When you start getting different answers, then i'm not getting the actual story and and they're assessing it and I get that as well [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1059.24s)]
*  You have to a little bit of grace back to the point. We're in this emergency environment and everything else [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1064.52s)]
*  Yeah, he's cooked [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1069.6399999999999s)]
*  What I love about this is that he's basically describing is I have to go talk to these other politicians and it's like talking to myself [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1071.1599999999999s)]
*  Yep, and so what do you know? I can't get an actual answer. Nobody's at fault [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1078.52s)]
*  This guy's saying it's that guy's fault. This guy's saying it's that guy's fault [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1082.52s)]
*  and uh [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1086.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, uh, he's got no way to sell this because he's on top. He's in charge and there was missing water from hoses [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1087.24s)]
*  Yeah, there are look man. There is something about it's like that old phrase the buck stops here [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1095.1599999999999s)]
*  There is just something about being a leader [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1101.48s)]
*  Where in the time of a crisis to come out and go I want to know too, man [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1104.6s)]
*  You know just like all you guys want to know though. I want to know too [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1110.36s)]
*  It's like dude people are looking at you [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1113.1599999999999s)]
*  They want to know and so they're looking at you to give them the answer and for you to say [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1114.6s)]
*  oh i'm going around and asking my team and they're telling me a whole lot of bullshit [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1118.36s)]
*  is [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1122.6799999999998s)]
*  That is just devastating. I mean that is just not good enough. You got to have something better than that [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1123.8799999999999s)]
*  And this is um, you know imagine like you're in this situation where you have to like evacuate your home with the things you have [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1130.0400000000002s)]
*  On your back because there's no time to even you know, uh, even think about bringing more stuff or packing a bag [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1137.24s)]
*  This is what your governor's telling you [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1143.96s)]
*  Like don't don't worry. He wants to know too [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1146.44s)]
*  That is rough, um also it's like you can't [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1150.92s)]
*  There is something about like throwing your team under the bus [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1156.44s)]
*  that is always I mean, this is like the [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1160.92s)]
*  This is the telltale sign [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1165.48s)]
*  Of failed leadership. I mean when you start throwing your own team under the bus and then saying oh i'm here on all these different [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1167.96s)]
*  You know contradictory things from them. It's like, okay. Well, first of all [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1173.8000000000002s)]
*  You hired your team [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1177.96s)]
*  That's on you [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1180.44s)]
*  That's on you [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1182.0400000000002s)]
*  You were supposed to put the people in place who would give you the answers, you know [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1183.4s)]
*  Um that you can't just sit there and say oh, I mean look at these guys [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1187.64s)]
*  Look at these clowns don't seem to know what's going on. That is a reflection of you and your leadership and your decision making so [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1192.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty honest come forward and go. Hey, we messed up [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1198.7600000000002s)]
*  We invested in lesbians and uh, it turns out that there are gender roles [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1201.96s)]
*  And uh certain jobs are just better done by other groups of people. Uh, we've seen it in professional sports [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1206.1200000000001s)]
*  And we made an error over here. So I promise we will clear all the lesbians out of the manly jobs in california [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1211.96s)]
*  Well, look to be clear, right? It's like look and this is the problem with affirmative action or dei [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1218.0400000000002s)]
*  Any of this type of stuff when you start making the emphasis that we're gonna hire, you know [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1223.72s)]
*  Uh people from different racial racial groups or or different sexes or whatever. It's like, okay [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1230.1200000000001s)]
*  So they wanted to get a lot of women [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1236.0400000000002s)]
*  into [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1238.2s)]
*  firefighting [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1239.7s)]
*  But what women are you gonna get? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1241.24s)]
*  Right like so so this is where you're getting like, you know [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1244.44s)]
*  You're gonna get the most masculine women in the same way that like if you were if your goal was to get a lot of men [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1247.64s)]
*  to be [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1254.04s)]
*  Nurses and preschool teachers you're gonna get the most feminine men. I mean that just typically speak [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1255.24s)]
*  I'm not saying in every single case but broadly that's what's gonna happen now that isn't in itself necessarily a problem [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1260.6s)]
*  I don't think like [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1268.1200000000001s)]
*  Dude, if there if there's some lesbian out there who? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1269.96s)]
*  Is just like the best candidate or any position then put them in that position and that's great [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1273.88s)]
*  The problem is that when you prioritize? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1279.88s)]
*  diversity over job performance [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1283.54s)]
*  Like one of the when those things butt heads [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1287.24s)]
*  The question is which one are you going to go with? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1291.24s)]
*  right, so if if you want like [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1293.88s)]
*  If you want to get more of a demographic that are that are unlikely to go into that field [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1298.5200000000002s)]
*  The the practical way to do that is always going to be to lower standards [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1305.0s)]
*  And so that's what ends up happening and that you pass over people who would have been better for this job [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1309.4s)]
*  Because your priority is diversity rather than simply who's the best for this job? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1314.3600000000001s)]
*  I swear you saw what some of these dykes look like you would have thought they were qualified, too [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1320.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, right [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1325.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, maybe but look, I mean as anyone knows I mean you can you know [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1327.1599999999999s)]
*  There's lots of examples that people like to go to like um [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1331.0s)]
*  Like surgeons and pilots, you know, uh are always the good ones. But listen if you if you or somebody you love [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1334.6799999999998s)]
*  Um has to have you know a risky surgery [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1342.36s)]
*  Believe you'll find out very quickly that you do not care [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1345.96s)]
*  And even like the most racist like even a member of the clue clucks clan in that moment does not care [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1351.0s)]
*  What race or gender? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1357.1599999999999s)]
*  Their their surgeon is you want the best you want the person with the best track record, you know the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1359.1599999999999s)]
*  Like that's it. That's who you want [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1365.6399999999999s)]
*  and [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1368.04s)]
*  Anytime that you start putting other criteria in [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1369.1599999999999s)]
*  You muddy those waters to some degree [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1374.28s)]
*  and that that's really um, what's so devastating about the dei stuff is that like positions like these like [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1376.84s)]
*  Until and it's different than being like a surgeon or a pilot where it's so obviously in front of your face every single time [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1386.04s)]
*  You do your job like people will die if you fail at this job [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1392.2s)]
*  But positions like this that maybe just seem like political appointments when the emergency strikes become every bit as important [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1396.12s)]
*  As as those maybe even more. Um, so anyway, let's uh, let's keep playing with the [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1404.28s)]
*  Gavin Newsom [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1409.8s)]
*  I just want to determine the facts, but no one has any patience anymore in this weaponized back to the grievance of trump [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1411.8s)]
*  Everyone else there's immediacy and lies travel the proverbial world and it's hard states literally unless you have back [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1419.32s)]
*  I mean, it's literally and then that was not the time for urgency. It's on fire, dude [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1427.56s)]
*  When is the time for it? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1432.04s)]
*  And and to try to tie it back to like trump or the misinformation or something out there [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1433.96s)]
*  I mean i've seen this by the way, it's it's like [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1439.32s)]
*  and again, this is [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1442.52s)]
*  It's it's it's funny because the internet has become like a convenient distraction for so many of these people [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1444.6799999999998s)]
*  Uh, it's like when you know, I see like there was this video [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1451.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you saw but there was a uh, like a I mean, I don't know if it's ai or how you do this [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1454.52s)]
*  Stuff, but there's a video of the hollywood hills sign burning [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1459.1599999999999s)]
*  Um, it's not real that wasn't on fire [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1463.6399999999999s)]
*  But they put a video out of it and it got shared a bunch of times and it's like, okay [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1466.52s)]
*  Yeah, there's misinformation out there. But like what? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1469.56s)]
*  The city is on fire like that's the real crisis here [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1472.9199999999998s)]
*  So what are we talking about with all of this like just like you're starting to blame people like is that really the problem? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1476.1999999999998s)]
*  Is that really the problem we need to focus on here? There's misinformation or whatever [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1483.0s)]
*  it's like they're always just trying to divert from their own responsibility and it's a [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1487.1599999999999s)]
*  A pathetic attempt to do so [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1492.28s)]
*  Um, yeah, let's let's finish it [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1494.68s)]
*  Those facts and you can communicate them soberly and so that's what we're trying to achieve as relates this [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1497.8799999999999s)]
*  But I have 10 other things we're doing concurrently as well [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1502.36s)]
*  I mean across the board on recovery [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1505.24s)]

*  With the white house within literally 36 hours [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1513.56s)]
*  To get 100 reimbursement for folks out here. We've been working concurrently in all of these areas [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1517.16s)]
*  We're doing executive orders as I speak as it relates to recovery and land use dealing with speculation and fraud and trying to address issues [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1522.3600000000001s)]

*  businesses all of this in real time again [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1535.88s)]
*  As the state even though this is not a state responsibility or to support the city and the county that are overwhelmed at this moment [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1538.8400000000001s)]
*  There you go rub [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1549.16s)]
*  Doesn't that make you feel better? It's actually just charity from him. Hey, baby [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1551.24s)]
*  I don't I don't this isn't my responsibility and I don't even need to work on this but out of the goodness of my heart [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1554.3600000000001s)]
*  Uh, even though it's not a state responsibility. We're gonna do our best to pitch in and figure out who's to blame. That's not me [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1559.96s)]
*  I'm on the phone. I'm writing executive orders. I'm juggling a lot of things right now. I mean [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1568.68s)]
*  Just this is really bad dude. And yeah, I gotta say I I don't think he survives this [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1575.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, I don't know man. We'll see but I mean, you know, it is [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1580.52s)]
*  California and california is as solidly blue as any part of the united states of america [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1584.74s)]
*  But this has got to be a bridge too far [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1592.52s)]
*  I mean you got to have something better to say than that [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1595.96s)]
*  during this situation and the kind of like uh [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1599.56s)]
*  the really [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1603.0800000000002s)]
*  And and it's not just gavin newsome i've seen do it a couple times [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1604.68s)]
*  But i've seen several other people in the media and then other democrats in california the attempt to like blame donald trump [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1607.4s)]
*  Which they've done a couple times like gavin newsome saying, you know [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1614.68s)]
*  like he wanted trump to come out there because he's worried he'll withhold aid or something like that and you're like [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1618.76s)]
*  dude, this is just [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1624.6000000000001s)]
*  I know you guys like to blame trump for everything, but this is like [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1626.2800000000002s)]
*  This one that is a real stretch [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1629.88s)]
*  That is a real stretch to try to somehow say it's his fault or whatever shift the focus onto what he's done wrong [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  Good luck. Good luck with that. Anyway, hope any uh part of the problem listeners out in los angeles are doing okay [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1639.64s)]
*  And uh, yeah, we'll see we'll see how long [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1647.0800000000002s)]
*  This goes and how much devastation there is doesn't look good from what i've been reading [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1650.44s)]
*  um, all right, let's switch gears because I did want to talk a bit about the um, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1655.0800000000002s)]
*  The continued [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1660.92s)]
*  rebranding of the zuck [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1663.46s)]
*  Which uh, of course we we discussed this on our last episode and and mark zuckerberg's announcement that twitter would now [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1666.6000000000001s)]
*  include [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1675.0s)]
*  Being able to say stuff [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1676.44s)]
*  Which is a nice feature for a social media platform [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1678.76s)]
*  um, of course zuckerberg followed this up by going on the joe rogan experience which was um, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1682.04s)]
*  I thought a very interesting interview that a lot of uh, some interesting details came out of we're gonna play one of the clips [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1689.0s)]
*  In a second here. Um, I watched most of it. I did not finish the entire thing [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1695.24s)]
*  What did you think of of what you watched of it or did you watch the whole thing rob or did you watch part of it? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1701.0s)]
*  Uh, well, I love joe rogan. What's that smile? What's your evil smile about? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1706.52s)]
*  I love joe rogan. I love the joe rogan podcast, but that's correct [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1711.8s)]
*  That is the correct answer when zuckerberg said the first time [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1715.8s)]
*  Whatever his new candid answer of uh, I built the only reason you build these companies is not for money [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1719.72s)]
*  But to give everybody a voice [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1725.64s)]
*  I was like I cannot listen to this horseshit. And so I caught a couple of the clips later [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1727.72s)]
*  Uh in which he does, uh admit to the extent that he felt threatened by the biden administration [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1732.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't give the guy a pass. I I mean, you know, yeah listen you're out [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1738.44s)]
*  You're trying to save your business and you're a bitch and uh, you fell for the last administration [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1742.12s)]
*  You tried to play ball with them as they removed our freedoms [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1747.1599999999999s)]
*  And uh, everyone was worse off for it and we all know what you did and now you're trying to rebrand and I guess [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1749.9599999999998s)]
*  Good for you trying to run your business and trying to rebrand but i'm on the sidelines going [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1755.7199999999998s)]
*  Hey, you're a fucking bitch, dude, and not just that [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1760.04s)]
*  You'll sell us out the next time if you can as well. You don't stand for anything and your product sucks [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1762.6s)]
*  Uh, can I if if I could first listen first of all [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1768.92s)]
*  I do tend to agree with you [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1773.32s)]
*  um, and [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1775.32s)]
*  As I mentioned in the last episode I struggle with this one this a little bit because I wanna I want to be able to take [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1776.76s)]
*  the win [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1783.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, and I don't want to be like I I never want to be um pessimistic [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1784.44s)]
*  I don't like cynicism and pessimism and I I [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1788.92s)]
*  You know, so like when a good thing happens, it's like, okay, this is good [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1793.0s)]
*  But it's impossible to not point out that every time this guy addresses [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1795.96s)]
*  His conversion it's never even presented as a conversion or even presented like he never [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1801.32s)]
*  Acknowledges his part in any of it and that really [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1808.26s)]
*  Bothers me and rubs me the wrong way [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1812.2s)]
*  Okay [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1813.8s)]
*  I do want to make this point by the way because I think I found a way to make this all about me [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1814.04s)]
*  And I always like to do that if I can um, no i'm i'm [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1818.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1822.04s)]
*  Speaking tongue in cheek obviously, but this is uh, I doubt I had anything to do with this at all [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1823.24s)]
*  But I will say there was a little bit of an interesting dynamic that I was thinking about which I did not [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1828.04s)]
*  think about on the last episode when we were talking about this, but so [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1833.0s)]
*  It was asked. Um [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1837.0s)]
*  Donald it was asked to donald trump if his threats [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1839.56s)]
*  To facebook if he thought had anything to do with this and donald trump said probably [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1844.04s)]
*  Um, and then stephen miller, uh in an interview recently [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1849.88s)]
*  talked about how zuckerberg came to mar a lago and how he talked to him and like all of this stuff and [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1854.52s)]
*  It did I just literally remembering this but if you recall [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1860.6s)]
*  When I went on tuckers show the uh, the last time [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1865.56s)]
*  I did a whole thing of like giving advice to donald trump about what I think he should do [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1869.64s)]
*  And this was one of my top pieces of advice that donald trump should be threatening the shit [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1874.84s)]
*  Out of google. Uh, now I didn't say facebook. I believe I said google, but you know this close enough [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1881.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, but that now I will say because i've seen this [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1887.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, by the way, i'm not saying trump took my advice on that [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1892.04s)]
*  I mean, i'm sure i'm not the only person who thought of this [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1894.92s)]
*  But I did think that that was his best way to play it was to just be like hey look [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1897.8799999999999s)]
*  You were in a situation there where it was a coin flip according to the polls of who was going to win the election [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1902.0400000000002s)]
*  Donald trump, what are you going to do? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1907.4s)]
*  You know google's doing all this funny business facebook did all this stuff last time [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1909.72s)]
*  Your only game here is to threaten them that like if I get back in there [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1913.96s)]
*  I'm going to ruin you if you interfere in this election at all and then make them too scared of that [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1918.3600000000001s)]
*  And it does seem like there's at least a reasonable chance that that had a real impact. I I think [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1923.96s)]
*  Zuckerberg clearly is courting favor with the new administration the same way [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1929.88s)]
*  He was courting favor with the old administration now you could certainly point out that [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1934.68s)]
*  In 2020 trump was president and he was still willing to go to bat for the other side. So [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1940.44s)]
*  Who exactly knows? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1946.52s)]
*  But I did see some people on on social media and stuff saying like oh like kind of calling out, uh [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1948.68s)]
*  Hypocrisy here, I guess like saying like oh you guys had such a problem with the government bullying social media platforms in the past [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1954.92s)]
*  But now when it's donald trump doing it you seem to be happy about it or whatever. I would just say that you know [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1962.44s)]
*  look like from [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1969.24s)]
*  My point of view as a you know as a radical libertarian [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1971.32s)]
*  I would say yeah, the government shouldn't be involved in any of this stuff. There should be no government involvement in in [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1976.2s)]
*  Big tech or any private business or anything that's like communications and stuff like that way the government should have no role in this whatsoever [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1982.8400000000001s)]
*  however [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1990.52s)]
*  Given that the first intervention happened already and if the threat is [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1991.88s)]
*  If you censor people were going to do this, I would see that being much preferable to a government threatening big tech [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=1998.28s)]
*  Companies to get them to censor people, you know [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2006.3600000000001s)]
*  It's kind of like when when people used to say like, oh, you know [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2009.48s)]
*  Uh gavin or not kevin is uh ron de santos banning private businesses from having vaccine mandates isn't libertarian [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2013.16s)]
*  It's like yeah, that's true [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2020.2s)]
*  But this whole thing was you know what I mean? Like the the entire thing was created by the government to begin with so like [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2021.16s)]
*  I'd rather a government intervention. That's at least like cleaning up the last government intervention or [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2028.44s)]
*  In this case just the threat of a government intervention to get you to stop interfering in elections [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2034.36s)]
*  And more importantly even than that to me is just to stop interfering with americans being able to communicate with one another [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2040.6s)]
*  So anyway [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2047.3999999999999s)]
*  I 100 support in the context of time [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2048.6s)]
*  Which is always continuing [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2053.56s)]
*  I do in this context absolutely support donald trump threatening [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2056.36s)]
*  Big tech companies that if they get in bed with the government to interfere in elections [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2061.4s)]
*  There will be consequences for that if that's what brought zuckerberg to this moment [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2067.16s)]
*  Well played I say [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2072.84s)]
*  All right, it's it it's in part that and I think we're also we're done with the whole esg score thing the payday [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2076.36s)]
*  That was supposed to come isn't isn't coming. We didn't revolutionize to full socialism [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2082.52s)]
*  You are going to have to somewhat contend in the market and actually [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2087.7400000000002s)]
*  Offer people free speech that they want to be on your platforms [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2091.26s)]
*  And so some of these businesses are having to repivot because the biden administration and all that didn't win and it's washing away. It's over [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2094.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that it does seem to be the case. Uh here. Let's go. Let's play this clip [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2103.42s)]
*  which I did think was the most interesting one of um, the [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2108.1400000000003s)]
*  Mark zuckerberg on the joe rogan experience [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2112.86s)]
*  And then the [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2115.02s)]
*  basically these people from the biden administration [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2116.94s)]
*  would [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2120.62s)]
*  Call up our team and like scream at them and curse and it's like these documents are it's all kind of out there [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2121.58s)]
*  Do you record any of those phone calls? I don't know. I don't think I don't think we've but but I think I want to listen [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2127.98s)]
*  I mean their emails the emails are published. It's all it's all kind of out there [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2133.18s)]
*  and um [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2137.34s)]
*  and they're like [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2138.78s)]
*  And basically it just got to this point where we were like no we're not gonna we're not gonna take down things that are true [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2140.46s)]
*  That's ridiculous. Um, they wanted us to take down this meme of leonardo. DiCaprio looking at a tv talking about how 10 years from now [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2146.14s)]
*  or something [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2153.82s)]
*  um, you know, you're gonna see an ad that says okay if you took a covid vaccine you're eligible, you know, you know like [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2154.86s)]
*  for for this kind of payment like this sort of like [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2162.14s)]
*  Class action lawsuit type meme and they're like no you have to take that down [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2165.26s)]
*  We said no, we're not gonna we're not gonna take down humor and satire [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2169.18s)]
*  We're not gonna take down things that are that are true [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2172.2200000000003s)]
*  and then at some point, um [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2175.7400000000002s)]
*  I guess uh [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2177.82s)]
*  I don't flipped a bit. I mean biden when he was he gave some statement at some point [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2180.38s)]
*  I don't know if it's a press conference or to some journalists where he basically was like these guys are killing people [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2184.38s)]
*  and and um [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2189.02s)]
*  and [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2191.34s)]
*  I don't know then like [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2193.42s)]
*  All these different agencies and branches of government basically just like started investigating coming after our company. It was it was brutal [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2195.2599999999998s)]
*  It was brutal [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2201.8199999999997s)]
*  Wow [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2203.1s)]
*  All right. So look [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2204.94s)]
*  To say here, I thought this really summed it up. It was interesting to hear uh zuckerberg say that [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2207.5s)]
*  um [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2213.18s)]
*  The thing and I know you're going to agree with me already on this rep [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2214.22s)]
*  but the thing that's infuriating about this and the reason why it is [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2217.2599999999998s)]
*  Again, I i'm always a big believer. Okay, let me put it this way. Okay, um [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2222.54s)]
*  so darrell cooper [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2229.02s)]
*  Uh who is um the as tucker carlson called him the most important historian in america today [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2231.1s)]
*  um, he's if darrell of course was is a friend of mine and was a guest on this show and what I always kept recommending [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2237.58s)]
*  To people to check out as he made this amazing series on the history of israel and palestine [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2243.98s)]
*  Uh that before the creation of the state of israel, which it's called the fear and loathing in the new jerusalem [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2249.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's on the martyr made podcast. It is so good. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It's like 26 hours long [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2256.94s)]
*  It's essentially a book on tape [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2263.5s)]
*  um, but it's so captivating and it's just [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2265.5s)]
*  filled with great history and it's a really interesting story by the way for most people, uh, just a little aside note, but [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2268.46s)]
*  It actually it most it made me more sympathetic to the israelis than I was coming into it or [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2275.7400000000002s)]
*  Zionist settlers because this is before the creation of of israel. It's it's not like a one-sided story [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2282.0400000000004s)]
*  It's just it's it's a retelling of the very interesting and complex history of the region. Anyway [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2287.98s)]
*  at the end of the this this series [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2294.7000000000003s)]
*  So you're 26 hours into it now and he's gone deep from the very beginning of of zionism all the way till I think it ends [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2298.62s)]
*  in 1947 like, you know world war two is over and the the creation of I think it I think [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2305.3399999999997s)]
*  I think it takes you through the un partition recommendation. Um, so [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2311.8999999999996s)]
*  But at the end of it, so you you've gone through 26 hours of this guy giving you like this in-depth [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2317.2599999999998s)]
*  very interesting and very brutal and bloody history of the region and [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2322.14s)]
*  What he talks about at the end [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2327.66s)]
*  Is how in order for peace, you know to ever be achieved there there has to be a recognition [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2330.62s)]
*  And an apology for some of the things that have happened in the past kind of on both sides [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2337.18s)]
*  And he goes look like you could you could say that this is overly, you know [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2342.14s)]
*  I don't know like naive or pie in the sky or something [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2345.98s)]
*  But he gets into this story about how there were um, there are these guys he knows he was a military guy [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2348.8599999999997s)]
*  Um, and how there are these guys who would go? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2353.98s)]
*  um [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2356.8599999999997s)]
*  essentially [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2358.3799999999997s)]
*  on [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2359.74s)]
*  like these missions to pay off [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2360.7s)]
*  people who we killed [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2364.4599999999996s)]
*  Or family members of people who we killed so like when there's like, you know [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2366.4599999999996s)]
*  Some you know, we we you know drone bomb some village in iraq or yemen or wherever [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2370.2999999999997s)]
*  And a few, you know 13 innocent people get killed. Well, the military will send some people there with a check [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2377.66s)]
*  And an apology which is very like crude in a way. You have to put a price on someone's nephew that you just killed [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2385.2599999999998s)]
*  And he was like he so he's talking to his buddy who did that [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2393.9s)]
*  And he was like Jesus that must be tough because like people must be so insulted and infuriated [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2398.94s)]
*  That you did this to that, you know, you're coming like you just like oh, sorry. We killed your kid. Anyway, here's a check [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2405.1s)]
*  And he said that his friend told him that that very rarely happens. They were very rarely very upset usually [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2411.9s)]
*  um [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2419.02s)]
*  they were just [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2419.98s)]
*  And even more even more so than the check [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2422.22s)]
*  Usually they really appreciated that someone was acknowledging that what happened to them happened and it was wrong [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2425.26s)]
*  and [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2432.46s)]
*  anyway, the point i'm making here is just that [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2433.42s)]
*  the [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2437.58s)]
*  Apologies are powerful things [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2439.26s)]
*  and if zuckerberg were to get on here and just kind of admit to his role in it and be like [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2441.66s)]
*  I just really feel bad that I played this role in it, you know, I think it would be much easier for someone like you [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2448.22s)]
*  Rob to hear it and go like all right good for this guy [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2454.62s)]
*  You know, I gave the example on the last show we were talking about it if there was like, you know [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2458.38s)]
*  Like, you know, you found out your wife or your husband was like having an affair for years and like [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2462.7s)]
*  Like maybe they're like for this analogy to fit this part [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2469.02s)]
*  Like they're having an affair for years and then the person's like I want you to leave your your husband and come run away with me [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2472.54s)]
*  And they say no, they're not going to do that and they come back [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2478.46s)]
*  But then as they're telling the story they were like and then he was like come run away with me [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2481.02s)]
*  And I was just like i'm not gonna do that. That's crazy [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2486.06s)]
*  you're like [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2489.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but what about the years before that? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2490.78s)]
*  You know, it's like zuckerberg is telling this story and he's going the government asked him to do it [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2493.6600000000003s)]
*  And then the government asked us to censor the truth and we were just like no [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2498.54s)]
*  We're not gonna do that [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2503.34s)]
*  And you're like [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2505.02s)]
*  Yeah after years of doing it [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2506.06s)]
*  Like no, sorry, that's not the story [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2509.1s)]
*  The story isn't that the government asked you to censor the truth [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2511.58s)]
*  But you refused because you're committed to free speech [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2514.3s)]
*  The story is the government asked you to censor the truth [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2517.1s)]
*  You said yes, sir, daddy government and proceeded to do it for eight years [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2519.9s)]
*  For eight years [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2526.14s)]
*  The worst of it was in 2020 and it continued all the way he just changed the policy last week rob [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2528.22s)]
*  Last week. Okay, the worst of it started in 2020, but it really started in 2017 [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2534.46s)]
*  He was doing it all through that time 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 22 23 24 [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2539.8199999999997s)]
*  Going into 2025 he stopped so sorry [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2547.74s)]
*  You can't tell that story and the story be the government asked us to censor the truth [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2552.06s)]
*  And we were like what? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2557.2599999999998s)]
*  No, we're not gonna do that. No, no [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2559.02s)]
*  What happened was that the government asked you to censor the truth. You said yes, sir [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2561.42s)]
*  You did it for eight straight years [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2565.2599999999998s)]
*  then [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2567.5s)]
*  That was soundly rejected by the american people and donald trump is now on his way to return into the white house [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2568.38s)]
*  And then you said all right, we're gonna let people tell the truth again [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2575.18s)]
*  Let's just let's just get it straight, right? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2579.98s)]
*  You know what? I mean rob like this is just like what actually happened here [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2583.42s)]
*  and [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2586.7s)]
*  at least from my perspective if the goal is to like [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2587.9s)]
*  Rehabilitate mark zuckerberg's image or if the goal is to rehabilitate the image of instagram and facebook [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2592.6s)]
*  That isn't doing it for me because it's just you're you're [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2600.7s)]
*  Sturking all responsibility [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2605.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? And like you you do have at least some and by the way [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2607.1s)]
*  I think there's also a way that zuckerberg could have said this [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2611.1s)]
*  To me and you particularly that would have gotten us to go like, okay fine [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2614.54s)]
*  Like if you've been like listen, man [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2619.9s)]
*  You don't understand the enormous pressure and I didn't really wake up to this myself [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2621.02s)]
*  Until kind of recently and I feel bad about what I participated in but like the government was telling me this and I just [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2625.26s)]
*  Can't you know like there's a way to say it, but this is just a like [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2631.02s)]
*  This is bad history. You know what? I mean? It's not true that it if this had happened [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2634.86s)]
*  Let's say by the way, he never engaged in the censorship [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2640.46s)]
*  The government came to him and said we want you to censor the truth and he said no like exactly [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2643.02s)]
*  But we were having this conversation in 2016 [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2647.1000000000004s)]
*  And he was just blowing the whistle and being like just so you guys know this is what the government's telling me [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2649.9s)]
*  But I said no we'd be lauding this guy as a hero [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2653.82s)]
*  Okay [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2656.86s)]
*  The problem is he's yada yada yada in over the eight years where he did censor the american people [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2657.6600000000003s)]
*  And I don't feel like the right thing to do is to just let that slide [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2663.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't know name [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2667.6600000000003s)]
*  names [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2669.34s)]
*  Yes, it's the I said on the last episode [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2671.5s)]
*  It's the same as the quomo thing when you leave cnn and then all of a sudden you're like, oh now i'm doing real journalism [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2673.5s)]
*  Well, then you gotta let us know what was keeping you from doing it the last time [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2677.9s)]
*  You gotta name some names that you didn't admit that you weren't doing it [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2681.42s)]
*  Yeah, and tell us them and tell us the mechanisms and the pay and all the reasons that you weren't so that maybe we can cleanse [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2684.86s)]
*  Whatever systems are in place that are keeping people from doing real journalism or in this case [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2691.98s)]
*  If uh government came around and they intimidated you into taking over your business that you were no longer an honest business [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2696.7799999999997s)]
*  name names [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2704.22s)]
*  And that's the only way to cleanse it [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2705.58s)]
*  And do something brave 100% [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2708.06s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is sheath underwear [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2710.06s)]
*  The best pair of boxer briefs you will ever own [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2715.2599999999998s)]
*  I love sheath underwear the only underwear that I ever wear [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2718.4599999999996s)]
*  The I threw out all my other pairs of boxer briefs because these are the best they're made with moisture wicking technology [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2721.66s)]
*  You just feel these things but even before you put them on just feel them in your hands and you're like, oh, yeah [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2727.74s)]

*  Leaving that aside [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2772.2999999999997s)]
*  And even though I don't know [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2776.14s)]

*  Meme what it's with the one meme that floated by that for some reason it probably right [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2782.06s)]

*  Just not completely removed and the idea that they weren't censoring when the fact checkers or whatever the covid team was [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2790.7799999999997s)]

*  CIA clean-up team that had to go oversee Facebook and to make sure that none of the true information [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2801.58s)]
*  Was going to be available on the platform. Yeah, the real story here, by the way goes all the way back to [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2807.02s)]
*  Cambridge analytical and fay and donald trump winning the first time and him being called in front of congress and that's why [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2813.74s)]
*  Actually tell the story you can we can showcase what the deep state did to the internet and educate the public [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2820.14s)]
*  To to the degree of censorship and socialism that we actually have here [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2826.78s)]
*  And the story is really fascinating. It's like oh the guy who wasn't supposed to win [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2831.18s)]
*  Won and he leveraged social media in order to do it and the government decided [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2835.66s)]
*  Well, we got to plug up that hole and then for eight years you helped them plug up that hole [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2840.06s)]
*  I mean like honestly, you can't you kind of can't overstate [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2845.3399999999997s)]
*  How consequential that was we have no idea what this country would look like if we had maintained freedom on the internet for those eight [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2849.1s)]
*  years, it's like [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2855.1s)]
*  different for sure [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2857.18s)]
*  Okay, that being said [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2859.18s)]
*  Look a lot of the stuff that he just said there [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2861.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm, not sure if all of it but a lot of it certainly was in the emails that that jim jordan, you know was able to get [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2863.1s)]
*  Um that have all been are all part of the public record now [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2870.06s)]
*  It still really is remarkable to hear the head of two of the biggest [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2874.46s)]
*  Social media sites [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2882.94s)]
*  Blatantly say this and I gotta say I do as was you know [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2884.7s)]
*  As we've said for a while. I do think it's like [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2890.14s)]
*  You know like we we have this dynamic all the time on the show rob. It's really unbelievable [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2893.98s)]
*  it's unbelievable how many times the um [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2899.1s)]
*  the [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2902.8599999999997s)]
*  The establishment, um, or just the the truth comes out [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2903.8199999999997s)]
*  um [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2908.7s)]
*  A year a year and a half two and a half years three years after we were talking about it on this show [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2909.98s)]
*  You know like now it's just the thing that you're allowed to talk about and now it's just the thing that we all admit is true [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2915.42s)]
*  That we were talking about when we were talking about it. It was like oh, this is a conspiracy theory or something like that [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2921.42s)]
*  Yeah, I was mentioning on the um [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2927.02s)]
*  The members only episode when they were trashing me on the reason round table [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2929.34s)]
*  Uh, this is two years ago now or I guess more than two years ago because I wasn't in this house yet [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2934.86s)]
*  So two and a half three years ago something like that and they were trashing me when I was saying when I was saying that [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2939.8199999999997s)]
*  Libertarians who go oh, it's a private company [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2945.64s)]
*  They can censor people if they want to we're idiots and we're completely missing the point because I was like this is clearly the government [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2947.58s)]
*  Who's doing this? It's not facebook who's censoring people [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2953.58s)]
*  It's the government censoring people and then they were trashing me on the reason round table and the cath uh, catherine [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2956.2999999999997s)]
*  Ward or whatever her name is was like [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2962.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, I guess dave can't tell the difference between the government and twitter dave doesn't know the difference between facebook and the government [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2964.94s)]
*  It's like hmm. I think you don't know the difference actually [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2971.82s)]
*  Um, but so anyway, it's nice to hear this like officially admitted and officially said [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2975.7400000000002s)]
*  I will say this [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2980.78s)]
*  In the spirit of not wanting to be pessimistic as I mentioned earlier [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2983.7400000000002s)]
*  I think here's a white pill for you. Okay. Here's the case for optimism [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2988.6200000000003s)]
*  How crazy is it? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2994.0s)]
*  That as I said before this most powerful of governments the most powerful government in the history of the world, you know [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=2995.8399999999997s)]
*  um [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3003.04s)]
*  Who's involved in just wars and you know regime changes and covert operations and all of this they really cared that much [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3004.16s)]
*  about a meme [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3013.2s)]
*  See that to me is actually really encouraging [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3015.2s)]
*  Like they were worried about a meme that was talking about how there's going to be a future class action lawsuit against the [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3018.8199999999997s)]
*  COVID vaccine and they couldn't allow that to happen [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3025.94s)]
*  That I think there's actually something really encouraging about the fact that they see satire as being such a threat to them [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3029.62s)]
*  It's like they know their policy is so ridiculous. They know their propaganda is so thin that they can't even allow [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3036.98s)]
*  For people to be able to mock it and the reason why that's so encouraging is because it kind of [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3044.9s)]
*  Look, it seems to indicate [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3051.54s)]
*  That they believe we have a real fighting chance [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3053.7000000000003s)]
*  You know what? I mean, like they believe that if we're allowed to do that, it's a threat to their ability to rule [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3057.2200000000003s)]
*  That I just find tremendously encouraging [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3064.82s)]
*  You get what i'm saying? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3067.86s)]
*  Yep, I mean we've said the example million times but it's the emperor with no clothes [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3070.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so they can't have anyone possibly pointing out. Hey, that's a fumbling. Oh man. That guy has dementia [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3074.34s)]
*  Hey, this new vaccine hasn't been tested. Hey, I don't I don't understand why I need it if it's supposed to protect you [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3079.54s)]
*  So then why am I danger if i'm leaving? Yeah, their lies are so big and so bold. They can't have any criticism [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3085.86s)]
*  and uh, that's why uh, elon musk [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3092.1s)]
*  Though I don't have a full picture of him at least the twitter [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3094.82s)]
*  restored freedom of speech to the internet and [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3098.1800000000003s)]
*  Completely eroded their game plan because what they're doing only works if they have full scale censorship [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3100.88s)]
*  It's like truth is like a leak in a building or something, you know [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3106.7400000000002s)]
*  If there's uh, if you don't plug the hole the water's coming through [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3109.94s)]
*  100 that's exactly right and I find that very encouraging especially seeing as how they these holes are now unplugged [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3113.44s)]
*  And it seems like we at least have some freedom of speech on the internet some not perfect [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3120.34s)]
*  But a lot more than we had before and I think that gives us a fighting shot to really [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3124.1800000000003s)]
*  Counter the propaganda and deprogram as many people as we can [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3128.82s)]
*  Um, okay. I did I wanted to play one more clip, uh before we get out of here [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3133.5400000000004s)]
*  Which is this one has been going super viral over the last few days. Here is uh, barack obama [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3138.02s)]
*  and donald trump [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3144.02s)]
*  hanging out [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3146.02s)]
*  At uh, jimmy carter's funeral, let's roll that [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3147.46s)]
*  President obama there elected in 2008 served two terms and then yielded there to president donald trump [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3156.58s)]
*  All right, I mean that's all that it is [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3165.54s)]
*  Now people are making a lot out of this but it is I suppose it does kind of say something right that [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3168.26s)]
*  It's like one more example of like, you know, you guys told us he was hitler you told us democracy was on the ballot [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3176.18s)]
*  It sure does seem like you didn't really believe any of that [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3183.3799999999997s)]
*  Sure does seem like george carlin said it's a big club and you ain't in it and there is um such a there is such a [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3188.2599999999998s)]
*  WWF, um [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3197.2s)]
*  Quality to politics where you really do have these guys who like when the cameras come on they act like they're mortal enemies [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3200.16s)]
*  but then [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3208.3999999999996s)]
*  They're having dinner together their kids are hanging out their friends. Um [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3210.16s)]
*  This is kind of just one more reminder of that [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3215.4399999999996s)]
*  But I don't know. I mean, I don't want to make anything more out of it than that [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3218.7999999999997s)]
*  it was pretty goddamn hilarious to just watch the dynamics between [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3221.6s)]
*  the um [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3226.3999999999996s)]
*  Like look, I i'm not trying to read too much into these little bits of video that we get but if you see the full thing [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3228.32s)]
*  it's like [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3233.92s)]
*  you just see like [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3234.96s)]
*  Trump and obama are are like dudes [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3236.4s)]
*  And they're just like hanging out and they're like, yeah [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3240.0s)]
*  We're you know, we're gonna laugh a little bit bill clinton is sitting right next to hillary clinton [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3241.76s)]
*  And you could just see all over his face [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3246.4s)]
*  He wishes he could be a dude so much like he's like man if I could just shake this one [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3248.1600000000003s)]

*  Um, and then kamala harris is just [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3256.0800000000004s)]
*  Furious man, and she's there's the one point where they actually get her looking over her shoulder [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3259.34s)]
*  And she just sees obama and trump laughing with each other and it was just I mean it was just perfection [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3264.1600000000003s)]

*  It's uh, but I I did notice bill in the background reading his pamphlet just being like look normal look normal [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3275.6800000000003s)]

*  Um, okay, so I did want to say there's that footage do you remember from the bush senior [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3283.36s)]
*  I think when he died and there was the spooky envelopes that they all got [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3289.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. That's right. I forgot about that [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3293.2s)]
*  Um, well, I did want to mention this so I was uh, so I was on pierce morgan show [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3296.4s)]
*  Uh few days ago and they never or they shouldn't say never but they almost never do this [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3300.88s)]
*  Um, but they they sent me the topics [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3306.56s)]
*  That we're going to talk about on the show usually they don't [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3309.04s)]
*  They usually they don't send me who's on the panel what the topics are. You don't know you just show up and you're in [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3311.7599999999998s)]
*  the middle of like a thing [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3315.92s)]
*  um, but [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3317.68s)]
*  So I one of the topics [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3319.7599999999998s)]
*  Was the legacy of jimmy carter? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3322.32s)]
*  And I was like, oh, yes [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3325.2799999999997s)]
*  I love this topic because [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3327.36s)]
*  I actually have something to say about this and not too many people do [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3329.7599999999998s)]
*  And like I so anyway, so i'm sitting there now if you go watch this appearance this most recent appearance and this um [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3334.16s)]
*  Toward the end of it. I'm kind of quiet like they're they're talking about tommy robinson and the um, the the [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3340.72s)]
*  Like muslim gang rapes in the uk that I guess were covered up for many years [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3348.64s)]
*  It's just not a topic. I know that much about [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3353.68s)]
*  And I don't really know anything about tommy robinson and then like, you know [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3356.0s)]
*  They're arguing over whether he's a good guy or a bad guy and I don't but i'm just sitting there in my mind [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3360.16s)]
*  Because i'm like, well next topic is jimmy carter [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3364.24s)]
*  And i'm really excited to talk about that [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3367.52s)]
*  And then they just never came to jimmy carter [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3370.3999999999996s)]
*  And pierce just ended the show and I was like, oh man, that sucks. I thought that was a way more interesting topic. Um [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3372.64s)]
*  So anyway, let me just say this here [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3379.6s)]
*  um, and of course, this is nothing like this, you know, it's it's like [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3381.6s)]
*  Like [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3385.44s)]
*  Our camp the the libertarian guys particularly led by uh, the great scott horton [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3387.44s)]
*  And his book enough already the first chapter is about jimmy carter [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3392.7200000000003s)]
*  I highly recommend people read chapter one of enough already and then the rest of the book for that matter [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3396.2400000000002s)]
*  but it has been interesting to me in in the week since uh, jimmy carter's funeral that [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3401.44s)]
*  Whenever anybody brings him up [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3407.92s)]
*  Nobody seems to actually talk about what was really impactful and lasting about his presidency, which was an enormously [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3410.32s)]
*  um [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3418.96s)]
*  Consequential presidency, even though he only had four years [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3420.2200000000003s)]
*  Um everybody when they talk about jimmy carter, they just tend to kind of say like [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3423.04s)]
*  It's like, I don't know rob. What's the jimmy carter thing? Well, he was like a really decent honest guy [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3427.28s)]
*  He was a peanut farmer, you know, and then he became president and like really sweet guy [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3430.96s)]
*  Maybe a little bit too liberal and ineffective and that's why he only got four years [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3437.36s)]
*  Then went on to be a real critic of israel for the years after he was president. That's a that's basically what said [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3442.1600000000003s)]
*  What jimmy carter, okay, so [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3450.88s)]
*  Jimmy carter was president. Um until [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3454.4s)]
*  Ronald reagan took office in 1981 january 20th of 1981 [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3458.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh, so jimmy carter was president during [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3463.04s)]
*  1979 and 1980 these were two [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3466.46s)]
*  Enormously important years and really laid the groundwork for all of the disaster in the middle east since then [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3470.54s)]
*  so in [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3478.48s)]
*  1979 [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3480.3s)]
*  You had a revolution in iran and a coup in iraq [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3481.6s)]
*  Um, so the the iranian regime that we know today they they came into power in [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3488.16s)]
*  1979 and saddam hussein [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3495.4199999999996s)]
*  uh came into power in in iraq [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3497.68s)]
*  and then [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3500.3999999999996s)]
*  The same year was the policy of luring the soviets into afghanistan by building up supporting the [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3502.56s)]
*  Mujahideen in afghanistan and of course as most people know at this point this didn't mean just supporting [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3510.9399999999996s)]
*  the afghan [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3516.96s)]
*  Mujahideen this included the foreign arab fighters coming in [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3519.02s)]
*  Including osama ben laden and many of the people who were involved in al qaeda [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3524.6400000000003s)]
*  um, so this was really a jimmy carter policy [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3530.0800000000004s)]
*  to teach [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3534.48s)]
*  osama ben laden [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3536.56s)]
*  How to lure a superpower into an unwinnable war in afghanistan in order to bankrupt them [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3538.2400000000002s)]
*  He was also the one who [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3545.1200000000003s)]
*  essentially [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3547.9s)]
*  greenlit saddam hussein [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3549.1200000000003s)]
*  To go to war with iran [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3551.6000000000004s)]
*  Um this brutal war that broke out in 1980 [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3553.92s)]
*  um something like 500 000 people on both sides died now in the [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3557.1200000000003s)]
*  In this war as this war breaks out in 1980, right? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3563.76s)]
*  So this is the dynamic you also you have the soviet union fighting a war in afghanistan [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3567.1200000000003s)]
*  And you have iraq and iran fighting war with each other and this is it was jimmy carter [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3571.52s)]
*  Under the advice of zabignou brzezinski who yeah the dad of that chick on morning joe who we like to make fun of all the time [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3576.7200000000003s)]
*  Remember that retard. Okay. Well her dad wasn't a retard her dad was a very smart evil guy [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3584.08s)]
*  But under his advice, they are the ones who set up what they called the carter doctrine [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3589.28s)]
*  So after the thing about how crazy this is, you know when you hear about like in syria how we're like, you know [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3595.6s)]
*  We're we're arming al qaeda in syria while we're fighting al qaeda in iraq. You remember how we were doing that for years? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3600.88s)]
*  Okay. Well, this is how crazy this is [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3607.52s)]
*  after they lure the soviets into afghanistan [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3609.68s)]
*  Then they all start getting worried that they're going to take iran next [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3613.84s)]
*  And then the soviet union is going to control the middle east oil supply [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3618.32s)]
*  So jimmy carter is the one who decides to push the carter doctrine which he he um, he first brought up [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3622.32s)]
*  It was early 1980. So it was his state of the union in 1980 and essentially what this doctrine was was to say [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3629.28s)]
*  That the persian gulf is america [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3636.8s)]
*  And if anyone moves on the persian gulf, we will take that as an attack on america now in order to do this [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3640.1600000000003s)]
*  Of course, we're going to have to start building up our bases around the arabian peninsula [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3646.1600000000003s)]
*  And so it was actually jimmy carter who put us on this path that ultimately led to the disastrous terror wars now [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3650.96s)]
*  Obviously i'm not putting all of the blame on jimmy carter [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3658.2400000000002s)]
*  There were a lot of people who came in after him and didn't have to make the decisions they made [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3660.6400000000003s)]
*  But that is the real legacy of the carter administration that he started us on this path that ended in all of these disastrous wars [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3664.8s)]
*  Um, so no jimmy carter was not a good man or a good president and the fact that he said some nice things about [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3673.2000000000003s)]
*  The palestinian people in the years afterward doesn't undo all of that shit [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3678.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay, anyway, just wanted to end on that. All right. Thank you guys very much for listening [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_tpqpe5ig&t=3682.48s)]
