# Dave Smith | HHS Finally Admits the Truth | Part Of The Problem 1270
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE)
*  What's up, what's up everybody. Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the fire Bernstein out on the road, bringing laughter to a sad [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=11.84s)]
*  world. How's the porch torn been going brother? Oh, this was an epic run of porches and I [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=17.2s)]
*  gotta let people know I did a great live pod with Scott Horton last night. It was the conspiracy [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=23.16s)]
*  debunker and I was forcing him to comment on things I think he'd otherwise not comment [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=27.2s)]
*  on and it was a great time. So I'm excited to listen to that. Yeah. I anyways fans of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=31.84s)]
*  the show should go check that out. They'll be out and run your mouth later this week. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=37.64s)]
*  And then I got my largest run of porches coming up with San Jose, Portland, Sandpoint, Idaho. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=40.12s)]
*  Then I'm with then I'm in Reno, Salt Lake City with you and then wise guys, Las Vegas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  That's the only one that's not on the porch tour.com. You can find everything on porch [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=50.8s)]
*  tour.com. Wise guys, Las Vegas is on their website and come party with me in Vegas. People [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=54.88s)]
*  will be there all five hours. So let's lose all of our money in five hours. Get out of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=58.64s)]
*  Vegas. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=64.2s)]
*  Five hours is actually a lot of time. If you really want to gamble with it, you could lose [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=65.2s)]
*  a lot of money in five hours. Well, that's that's great. And then of course, as Rob mentioned, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=69.92s)]
*  we'll be out in Salt Lake City. And then we got a bunch more dates coming up comic davesmith.com [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=74.36s)]
*  for all of that, for all of those ticket links for me and Rob traveling together for the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=79.84s)]
*  rest of the year. All right. Well, I do apologize for the slightly late start time. I was just [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=84.2s)]
*  finishing up an episode of Pierce Morgan and who it was a banger. I was debating some lawyer [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  lady about Israel. And I will tell you there is something something really beautiful is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=97.06s)]
*  happening with Pierce Morgan, where he is just he is over the Israeli bullshit. Like [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=104.44s)]
*  he's actually he's a know what you can see it in him. And like, you know, look, I don't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=112.64s)]
*  I don't know Pierce Morgan like super well, personally. You know, I obviously I've done [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=117.52s)]
*  the show a bunch of times, but you know, I do the show. I've done the show twice with [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=124.2s)]
*  him in person, like when he was in America. And so I hung out, I got to talk to him a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=131.16s)]
*  little bit those two times. And then we've messaged back and forth a few times. But every [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=136.32s)]
*  time I do the show remotely, there's no like conversation. He films them like one after [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=140.32s)]
*  the other after the other. So you come in and film your segment and then you leave. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=144.88s)]
*  So anyway, I say all this to know that I'm not like, I'm not basing this off some insider [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=149.08s)]
*  information, or I was talking to Pierce over lunch, and he was telling me this. I'm just I [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=153.28s)]
*  have the information that everybody has. But you can tell. So Pierce basically through [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=157.68s)]
*  this whole thing was always on the fence. I would say on the fence more in the pro [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=164.16s)]
*  Israel side, like center pro Israel. And I say that just because I think he and I don't [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=170.12s)]
*  even mean this as an insult. I think Pierce is a creature of the legacy media. He came [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=177.36s)]
*  into it with a lot of the biases of the legacy media. He was kind of he was always famous [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=182.36s)]
*  for his first questions. When talking Israel, Palestine would always be something like doesn't [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  Israel have a right to defend itself? Do you condemn Hamas? You know, it was always kind [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=193.56s)]
*  of it. But but he was he would host these debates. And so he's probably hosted more [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  Israel debates than anybody else on this humongous show, where he's getting millions of views [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  on every show. And it's just over the months and now almost going on two years of hosting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=208.88s)]
*  these debates. I he you can very clearly see that he is resentful that the pro Israel side [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=215.6s)]
*  insults his intelligence every time they talk to him. And there was one point today where [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=223.84s)]
*  this woman I was debating and literally I mean, you guys will see it when it comes out. Pierce [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=229.24s)]
*  just cannot stand her bullshit. And so it just became funny because it was like Pierce almost [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=233.24s)]
*  jumped in and was just arguing with her for half the time. But at one point, she just [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=237.84s)]
*  sticks on this thing, which it's unbelievable. You know, Rob, over the years, you do you've [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=242.16s)]
*  done this thing many times where you just play like you almost like play a character [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=246.72s)]
*  of advisor to the regime. And you're like, listen, no, this propaganda won't work. You [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=251.76s)]
*  got to at least say this. But man, could these Hasbra propagandists use one advisor who tells [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=256.96s)]
*  them that, listen, you can't look another sentient adult in the eyes, like assuming [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=265.2s)]
*  they weren't like kicked in the head by a horse and they have a fully functioning brain. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=272.2s)]
*  You can't look them in the eyes and tell them that the reason Israel won't let journalists [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=277.36s)]
*  into Gaza is because they're worried something bad could happen to the journalists. Like [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=282.44s)]
*  you just can't say that to another human being because she tries to argue that and peers [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  is just so infuriated by it. It was beautiful to watch. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=292.04s)]
*  Anyway, Israel accidentally killed them sometimes. They've killed more journalists in this conflict [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=296.92s)]
*  than it like in any other modern war. But they're saying the reason they won't let any [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=302.48s)]
*  Western journalists in is because they're just worried it's dangerous over there. And [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  oh my God, it's just so it's it's a you know, it's almost like you know, I'm like in in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=313.12s)]
*  high school like debate clubs or something like that. You know how the thing is that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  they force you to argue both sides of a topic and you could see where like there's some [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=325.72s)]
*  there's some utility in that exercise for like a 16 year old. You know, it's like I [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  want you you know, I could see that like if you had like a 16 year old who's doing a debate [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=336.26000000000005s)]
*  thing, you're like, I want you to argue the pro choice side and then I want you to argue [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  the pro life side and I want you to steal man each side's arguments. You know, you could [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  see where that's a good like intellectual exercise. There's something about listening to people [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=349.0s)]
*  debate that we're like at a certain point, you're almost like, look, I got to tip my hat to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=355.23999999999995s)]
*  you, because I understand that this is really unfair that I drew the side that has the truth [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  on it. And you drew the side that's based off pure bullshit. And like good for you. You [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  know, maybe this is what I was gonna say. So that fucked up. I shouldn't say. But I was [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=367.32s)]
*  gonna say it maybe it's the Jew in me that really appreciates it. You know, they go like, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=372.96s)]
*  Hey, listen, I admire the way you're trying to argue this bullshit point, and you just [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=377.12s)]
*  cannot do it. But dude, she's arguing at one point that it wasn't fucked up, that Israel [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  didn't allow any food or aid in for three months, because they had already allowed enough [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=387.7s)]
*  aid and food in that it should have been enough calories for all the people of Gaza, but [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=393.64s)]
*  Hamas was hoarding it. But then you're like, so I sat there and I went, Okay, wait a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=397.96s)]
*  minute. So if Hamas is hoarding the food and aid, then you're not depriving them of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=403.06s)]
*  food and aid. Who are you depriving of food and aid? Oh, yeah, the civilian population. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=410.22s)]
*  That's who's left, right? Like if Hamas already has what they need, then keeping it out [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=417.5s)]
*  isn't keeping it out of the hands of Hamas. It's keeping it out of the hands of the babies. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=421.54s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about here? And there's just so many there's just so many [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=426.02s)]
*  things like this. She at one point, she argued that that we know the Hamas, the Gaza [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=429.76s)]
*  Health Ministry numbers are bullshit. And Pierce was like, Well, how do you know? What are [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=437.92s)]
*  the real numbers? And she goes, I don't know. I don't know what the real numbers are. And [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=442.52s)]
*  then she goes, Well, how do you know that their numbers are bullshit? And she goes, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  because Hamas lies. And he goes, Well, how do you know Hamas is lying? And then she goes, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=449.08s)]
*  Well, we know Hamas is lying, because even Hamas revised down their number of dead [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  civilians at one point. And I was just like, No, that's a that's a point in my favor, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=458.92s)]
*  not yours. Like, it's amazing how they like they they try to take that as a wait. So [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=465.08000000000004s)]
*  you're saying it's proof that Hamas lies because they revise their numbers down. Why [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=470.24s)]
*  would they revise their numbers down? That's a point toward them being honest, like [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  against their own interests. They like why wouldn't they just not revise the numbers [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=478.88s)]
*  and keep them artificially high? Why wouldn't they double them or triple them? It's like, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=483.44s)]
*  anyway, it's all just like, it becomes infuriating when you're actually arguing [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  with someone like that. Because you're just like, Oh, you don't even you don't even [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=492.04s)]
*  believe the shit you're saying. You're just like, Look, this is my job. I took on a [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=495.88000000000005s)]
*  client. My client is Israel. I know they're guilty. But the code of a lawyer is fucking [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=501.20000000000005s)]
*  you still have to fucking present the best defense you can even for a guilty client. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=507.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm getting a housekeeping knock, which I've already addressed three times. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=512.96s)]
*  Are you over? Are you in the hotel longer than you're supposed to be? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=518.76s)]
*  Oh, my God, I don't get me. I called ahead, had to get through, said I'm only making [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=523.36s)]
*  the reservation. I got work I got to do made the arrangements. I check in at two in [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  the morning and they're like, Yeah, that's not here. We can't help you out. And had to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=533.24s)]
*  wake up early this morning to go down. They've already knocked on the it's just [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=537.48s)]
*  listen, I've been there. I've been there before. It's also whenever you need special [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=541.96s)]
*  accommodations at a hotel, whenever you call ahead as somebody who's just traveled a [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=546.2s)]
*  lot, whenever you call ahead and you need to make the accommodations, first off, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  you're going to get the nicest lady that's ever worked at that hotel. You know, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  you're going to speak to Helen and Helen is just the nicest lady. She has assured [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=559.84s)]
*  you that they have everything you need. No problem. You can do all of this as soon [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=564.2s)]
*  as you get there. We'll be like, who told you this? Helen? I don't know a Helen. Do [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=569.08s)]
*  you guys know a Helen? Everyone? It does. I've never I've worked here 20 years. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=573.6s)]
*  I've never met Helen and you're like, Oh man, this is they don't have any of it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=577.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay. Anyway, let's get into the show. I'm looking forward to that episode of peers [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  coming out. I think you guys will enjoy it. Never. It's usually it's the day of or [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=586.32s)]
*  the next day. So probably not today or tomorrow. Okay. So let's get into some [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=590.12s)]
*  stuff. One of the topics that we did discuss this a little bit on the members [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  only stream, but there's some new stuff that's come out and it's just, I cannot [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=598.76s)]
*  overstate how much I love that Jake Tapper is going on this goddamn book tour. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  It's just so great. It's just like one of the best it's this it's an obvious [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=611.6s)]
*  attempt at you know, it's a propaganda tour. It's an attempt to alleviate the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=618.84s)]
*  indictment. Is that my using these words, right? But you get what I'm saying. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=627.96s)]
*  It's an attempt to let the corporate press off the hook for the failures of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=630.96s)]
*  not covering the blatantly senile president. It is you would think that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=635.9200000000001s)]
*  right away, like if you were in a smoke filled room, there's some build a bird [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=643.1600000000001s)]
*  meeting or something like that and you were plotting out how do we get the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=648.2s)]
*  people back to CNN or how do we how do we have a limited hangout where we admit [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=651.76s)]
*  that Biden was senile but we you know, don't give up all the information you [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=657.08s)]
*  would think that if this was proposed, someone in that room would have gone [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=661.5200000000001s)]
*  guys, this is not going to work. This is just all all you're going to do is [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=665.5600000000001s)]
*  remind everybody of how senile Joe Biden was and how the entire media covered it [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=669.88s)]
*  up yet. Regardless, they continue this tour. I've enjoyed every inch of it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=675.72s)]
*  Not only is it great, but this is even a shift in the propaganda and spin that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=684.24s)]
*  they're trying to push. So I thought that this was actually the most interesting [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=688.36s)]
*  of the Jake Tapper clips so far. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, he's been doing a whole bunch of shows. I will say that of the ones [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=695.1600000000001s)]
*  that I've seen him do, I thought Megan Kelly gave him a little bit. You know, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=699.48s)]
*  she did a decent enough job, but even her and I say this about Pierce Morgan as [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  well, who I'm very grateful to for platforming me all the time. But I say [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=711.6s)]
*  this about Pierce Morgan, Stephen A Smith was just ridiculous. And with Bill [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=716.0s)]
*  Mar, all of them have just been pathetically soft. I mean, like it is [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=720.36s)]
*  just a guys coming on here and telling you that there was no way we could have [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=724.68s)]
*  known or reported that the emperor was naked. It's just too ridiculous. And [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=729.84s)]
*  they're they're attempting, it seems, to let him get away with that. At least to [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=734.3199999999999s)]
*  some degree. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=738.88s)]
*  I thought Megan Kelly dug in and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=739.84s)]
*  he was good. Yeah, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=741.64s)]
*  she was the best. She was the best. But I guess I guess even with her, I felt like [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=743.12s)]
*  she eventually let it go. And then like let him just get his piece. I mean, she [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  did ask some good questions, but it should be I think it should be even [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=751.84s)]
*  harsher than what she did. She was clearly the best of the of the group. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=754.96s)]
*  All right, let's so this is a clip from Bill Mar's show, where Jake Tapper and [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=759.88s)]
*  as a co author, everybody leaves him out of this conversation. But they were on [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=765.2s)]
*  let's let's go to the clip. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=770.6800000000001s)]
*  Order policy, it seemed like under the bite, and we couldn't admit it was a [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=773.84s)]
*  problem. But can I say and the Democrats? Okay, well, I don't. I think you're [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=777.0s)]
*  complimenting it by calling it a policy. Just not not not to talk about my book [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=780.96s)]
*  again. But one of the things we discovered when we did this book, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  original, so I think pull back a little bit to build a Senator. Senator. Yeah, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=788.2800000000001s)]
*  like just a little bit before then probably and my mistake. This is not his [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=792.9200000000001s)]
*  co author who's on with him. I misremembered this. That was the other [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=796.6800000000001s)]
*  interviews is where he might get sent back. Right? Well, we don't have a great [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=799.52s)]
*  history of sticking by our promises. No, same happened in Vietnam, obviously. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  The Kurds. Yep. Remember the Kurds? promise them a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Although [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=811.28s)]
*  to be fair, we took in a lot of Vietnamese refugees and yes, they're [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=816.52s)]
*  around Northern Virginia today. And they're great contributors to our [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=821.0799999999999s)]
*  society. I mean, let's also not forget what immigrants do. I mean, immigrants [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=824.16s)]
*  founded Google, eBay, right? I mean, they're great contributors to our [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=828.4s)]
*  economy to our society. We are a country of immigrants, right? I think five of [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=833.7199999999999s)]
*  our top 10, but you would pause it already right there. This is there's even [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  I do find this to be something and this is kind of aside from the topics that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=842.68s)]
*  we're going to get into. But don't you Rob, I find this kind of interesting. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=846.76s)]
*  You know, I just had a big immigration debate. So this stuff has kind of been [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=849.72s)]
*  on my mind and also it's just, it's a big topic, but it is interesting where [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=852.88s)]
*  you'll see these things that like proponents of mass immigration and then [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=857.6s)]
*  proponents of immigration restrictions will do on one side or the other. But [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=864.28s)]
*  it's almost like, well, look, if you get to do this on one side, then we get to [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=869.88s)]
*  do this on both. Like you could sit here and say, well, look, there are these, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=873.4s)]
*  you know, like, look, the say the the Southeast Asian immigrants or the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=877.5600000000001s)]
*  Vietnamese immigrants who have come in after the war have been assimilated [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=884.16s)]
*  quite well. And things are going quite good with them. It's like, okay, well, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=888.8s)]
*  which immigrants haven't been assimilated well? Like, are you are you [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=892.5999999999999s)]
*  criticizing the ones who haven't been? Are you you know what I'm saying? Like, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=895.56s)]
*  so then is it also the case that I get like if I I'm just saying, if you get to [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=898.5999999999999s)]
*  brag about the ones who have assimilated well, do I get to like I'm from New [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=903.8s)]
*  York City, do I get to point out Chinatown where literally they have their [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=907.88s)]
*  own language, their own stores, their own they none of those motherfuckers speak [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=911.64s)]
*  the language. Good luck. Go through Chinatown and try to find I mean, the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=915.3599999999999s)]
*  kids do but go through Chinatown and try to find someone over 40 who speaks [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  English like next to impossible. You go into there, they have stores in [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=921.32s)]
*  Mandarin or Cantonese or whatever, like on the rappers. Okay, like if you're [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=925.44s)]
*  going to go, Hey, look, there was immigrants founded Google or something [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  like that. You're like, Okay, how about the ones who did 911? Like, you know [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=934.44s)]
*  what I'm saying? Like they were foreigners who were in the country. And [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=940.12s)]
*  or it's like, you know, the the the immigrants who are criminals, it's just [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  weird that people get to like, point to the immigrants who contribute to the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=947.6s)]
*  country while ignoring all the rest of it. But anyway, just a thought. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=952.84s)]
*  And it doesn't speak to you could probably just have the upside of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=958.44s)]
*  immigration if you didn't just pour everyone across the border. And I'm going [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=961.5600000000001s)]
*  to guess if you even look at the specific examples, I don't know them of [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=965.76s)]
*  the CEOs, my guess is they didn't just illegally come over our southern border. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=969.48s)]
*  Yeah, that would that would be my guess for sure. I also said this is not mine. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=974.16s)]
*  But I did I quoted this in the debate, I gave her credit, but it was Ann Coulters, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=979.12s)]
*  which I always thought was a great point, because she was arguing with someone who [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=982.56s)]
*  said that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than the domestic population. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=986.4399999999999s)]
*  And our first response that was that that's not true. And if you look into the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=992.12s)]
*  studies, that's actually like bullshit, which I think I tend to think she's right [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=995.84s)]
*  about, although it's not it's difficult to measure. I've been looking into these [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=999.56s)]
*  studies in preparation for that debate. I did. It's just very difficult to [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1003.44s)]
*  measure, because the truth is, they don't keep good data on this stuff. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1006.1600000000001s)]
*  Even the Cato guys admitted that and they did one study in Texas. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1010.2800000000001s)]
*  But like Texas was one of the only states that even kept good data. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1014.36s)]
*  So it was like almost impossible. Anyway, regardless of that, the point is she [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1017.1600000000001s)]
*  and Coulter goes, which I thought was a great way to look at it, is she goes, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1022.32s)]
*  yeah, but I don't care if they commit crime at a lower or a higher rate. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1025.48s)]
*  The fact is, they're committing crimes. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1029.04s)]
*  And she was like, that's like saying that, like, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1031.32s)]
*  if you have had a refrigerator full of food and half of it is spoiled or [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1034.24s)]
*  rotten, and then you went to the supermarket to get to go shopping and you were [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1039.08s)]
*  like, well, a third of the food you got at the supermarket is rotten. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1044.0s)]
*  But that's a lower rate than the food that you have in your refrigerator. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1048.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but the expectation when you go to the supermarket is that [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1051.52s)]
*  100% of your food will not be rotten. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1056.6s)]
*  Like that's the why or why am I bringing more rotten food into my house? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1059.2s)]
*  I already have a problem with rotten food here. And so it's like, to your point, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1063.24s)]
*  it's like, yes, the whole idea of an immigration system, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1067.08s)]
*  of having immigration policy at all. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1070.8799999999999s)]
*  The idea is that you want to bring in the people who are going to contribute to [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1073.8s)]
*  your country and not the people who are not going to contribute to your country [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1077.52s)]
*  or be a drain on your country. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1081.6399999999999s)]
*  And so the fact that you can point to some people who contribute and then [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1083.48s)]
*  therefore turn back to the Biden policy and say, hey, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1087.6399999999999s)]
*  let's remember when he had this policy of millions of people pouring over the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1091.04s)]
*  southern border illegally, that there are good things that immigrants do. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1095.12s)]
*  It's like, well, yeah, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1098.76s)]
*  that would be an argument to not have 100% closed borders and to have an [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1099.84s)]
*  immigration policy. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1104.8s)]
*  But that's not an argument for open borders or de facto open borders. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1106.32s)]
*  Okay, let's go back to the clip. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1111.1599999999999s)]
*  Backlash to that. We had an open border policy that is the bite. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1114.32s)]
*  Okay, but you would admit that that's where this feeling comes from. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1119.2s)]
*  Of course, it's carried out in a horrible way, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1123.24s)]
*  but that's where if you do something, there's always going to be a counter to it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1125.1599999999999s)]
*  I think there's a bit of just racism, bank, there is, there absolutely is. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1129.56s)]
*  Democrats, there was also an open border policy. It seemed like under the bite. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1133.04s)]
*  And we couldn't admit it was a problem. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  But can I say, and the Democrats, okay. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1138.32s)]
*  Well, I don't, I think you're complimenting it by calling it a policy, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1140.3999999999999s)]
*  just not, not, not to talk about my book again. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1144.16s)]
*  But one of the things we discovered when we did this book, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1147.28s)]
*  original send me and Alex Thompson is there, there's a Senator, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1149.36s)]
*  Senator Bennett from Colorado who went to an event in June, 2024, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1153.24s)]
*  where Biden seemed non-functioning and he left that event. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1156.76s)]
*  And this is in the book thinking this is why our, our border policy, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1160.76s)]
*  our immigration policy is such a mess. This guy can't manage the portfolio. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1164.2s)]
*  They're competing groups within the administration and he's not engaged [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1168.0s)]
*  for whatever reason. And that's why this policy is such a mess. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1173.2s)]
*  And I know that the secretary of the department of Homeland security, Mayorkas, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1176.64s)]
*  he thought there was going to be an order early on in the Biden years, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1180.6000000000001s)]
*  shutting down the border or at least providing more security. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1184.76s)]
*  And the order never came. So people talk about, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1187.6000000000001s)]
*  what are the repercussions of, of, of Biden not being what we expect [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  a president to be just in terms of functioning 100% of the time. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1195.0s)]
*  This is one of those things. So I think calling it a policy might be a little [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1198.2s)]
*  off. Honestly, it's not just Biden. There you go. Go ahead, Rob. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1201.48s)]
*  Now you have the border border by the Biden border wall coverup, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1205.64s)]
*  which is that they were not trying to get as many people over the border as [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1209.8s)]
*  possible, but it was because of Biden's dementia. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1213.04s)]
*  He wasn't able to actually enact policy. And so we overlooked it. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1215.88s)]
*  And just to talk about how ridiculous this claim is firstly, go watch Meyer, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1219.4s)]
*  Meyer, carditis and all those hearings. He was border Fauci. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1223.6000000000001s)]
*  He was lying through his teeth. And later when they, uh, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1226.96s)]
*  when the election came around, they decided to actually deal with the border. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1230.72s)]
*  When they lied to the American people and said, Hey, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  we have to legalize 5,000 people coming over a day. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1235.96s)]
*  Otherwise I can't shut down the border and nobody bought that bullshit. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1238.5600000000002s)]
*  And it became a sore talking point. They managed to shut down the border. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1242.2s)]
*  They intent and someone was creating policies for the parole system. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1245.5200000000002s)]
*  Someone was creating policies of just looking like, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1249.2800000000002s)]
*  and there were NGOs down there bringing people over. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1252.5600000000002s)]
*  There was a movement within the Biden administration to get as many people [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1255.3999999999999s)]
*  across that border as possible. I can't tell you the specific reason why it was [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1258.32s)]
*  happening. I don't know who was involved with it, but it was going on. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1261.6s)]
*  So point number one is this is bullshit. This is now the coverup of no, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1265.1599999999999s)]
*  they didn't actually intentionally do it. It was that Biden had dementia. Fine. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1268.8s)]
*  Even if a Biden had dementia, some of my orcas couldn't do anything. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1273.0s)]
*  There was nothing that could be enforced. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1276.32s)]
*  You didn't need an executive order to shut the border. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1277.6399999999999s)]
*  You're not supposed to have people pouring over the Trump administration did [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1279.9599999999998s)]
*  instantly. The second that this administration was out, that's one. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1283.6799999999998s)]
*  Two is whoever this guy is who observed that Biden was so incapable of doing his [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1286.6s)]
*  job, that he was creating a border problem. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1291.9199999999998s)]
*  The fact that he didn't act as some sort of a whistleblower and every other [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1294.36s)]
*  person that observed Biden's behavior, then you are responsible. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1297.52s)]
*  If you're observing that the commander in chief can't do his jobs and that [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1300.84s)]
*  there's a crisis because he can't do his job, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1304.08s)]
*  you have a responsibility to report on that and make that storyline known. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1306.4399999999998s)]
*  So no matter what, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1310.4399999999998s)]
*  there's fault within the Democratic party for what happened at that border. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1311.36s)]
*  And you're now listening to this guy who not just wrote the book, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1314.4399999999998s)]
*  trying to cover up for the dementia, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1316.8s)]
*  but now the dementia coverup is going to include, well, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1318.4399999999998s)]
*  all of these failed policies were a result of that dementia, which, uh, yeah, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1321.1599999999999s)]
*  they should have told us about, but no one needs to be accountable for. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1324.8s)]
*  Yeah, dude, I very well said. Um, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1328.08s)]
*  and I do appreciate that you consistently call my orcas myocarditis. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1331.1599999999999s)]
*  I do just think that I find that very charming. Um, no, uh, it's, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1336.48s)]
*  no, that's right. You know, it's, um, you know, I said literally, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1341.52s)]
*  just to go back to this, it's just in my mind, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1345.2s)]
*  but I said on this Piers Morgan, uh, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1347.1599999999999s)]
*  debate that I was on at one point where I said, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1349.4399999999998s)]
*  when it comes to international law, I'm Lysander Spooner. Like I don't, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1351.6399999999999s)]
*  and I said that, uh, I go, look, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1356.36s)]
*  either international law allows Israel to do what it's doing to Gaza, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1357.9199999999998s)]
*  or it's been powerless to stop them either way. It's unfit to exist, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1362.48s)]
*  you know, like, and, and, and then I said, you know, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1367.48s)]
*  it's clearly seems to be the latter, not the former. I mean, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1369.48s)]
*  the ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu for war crimes. So, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1372.84s)]
*  like the international law is trying to do what it can, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1377.6s)]
*  but it's powerless to stop it at the same, in the same sense. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1379.8s)]
*  If the democratic party and the media apparatus, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1384.3600000000001s)]
*  like if this is what you're claiming, the president is so senile, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1388.88s)]
*  cause think about what this claim is here. He's, this isn't just like, Oh, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1392.72s)]
*  he has bouts of senility. You're saying he is so senile, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1395.44s)]
*  all the time that he does not even know what his border policy is. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1399.0400000000002s)]
*  He's not even aware of like one of the most consequential important policies [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1403.2800000000002s)]
*  that he has. And yet that still doesn't get reported. That's still, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1406.96s)]
*  the media apparatus is still so incompetent that this doesn't become a major [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1411.16s)]
*  story. Then it's an, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1415.8000000000002s)]
*  it's still an indictment of the entire media apparatus. But also it's just, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1417.2800000000002s)]
*  you know, like Jake Tapper's being a little bit cutesy here when he says, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1421.44s)]
*  then it's not a policy. No, it's still a policy. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1424.7600000000002s)]
*  It's like saying like, um, you know, if I'm like, Hey, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1428.2s)]
*  I'm not driving my car. I'm not in my car right now, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1432.28s)]
*  but you can see my car going down the street. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1435.68s)]
*  That doesn't mean it's not a car anymore. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1437.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean it's not being driven anymore. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1440.2s)]
*  It just means that somebody else is driving this car or the car is in neutral [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1442.5600000000002s)]
*  and it's falling down the hill or whatever. But like, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1446.72s)]
*  even if you're saying Joe Biden had no idea what this policy was, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1449.16s)]
*  it was the policy. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1452.64s)]
*  I don't sit here and tell me for a second that Joe Biden, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1454.0800000000002s)]
*  the defense is actually that he was so senile that everyone else in the [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1457.16s)]
*  government was just waiting for some executive order to come down. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1461.76s)]
*  That never did. By the way, lots of executive orders did come down. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1464.48s)]
*  Why wasn't this one of them? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1469.3200000000002s)]
*  He wasn't too senile for all the other executive orders or other people around [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1471.2s)]
*  him just fucking wrote them and then auto penned his name on them or whatever [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1475.68s)]
*  you want to say. But no, I'm sorry. And then also right, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1479.44s)]
*  Rob, to your point, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1483.2s)]
*  somehow he wasn't so senile that this policy couldn't be reversed [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1484.2s)]
*  as he headed into an election year. Right? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1488.96s)]
*  Like, so what are we talking about here? No, this wasn't a pop. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1492.96s)]
*  This was a policy. It was intentionally done. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1496.44s)]
*  Now if you want to argue to me that Joe Biden was so senile that he didn't even [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1499.8s)]
*  know the policy was being done or he wasn't even aware of it or sure I'm, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1503.24s)]
*  I'm all ears. I'm open to that. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1506.48s)]
*  But somebody there is responsible for this policy, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1508.28s)]
*  which was done intentionally to flood the country with millions of [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1512.0s)]
*  illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and all types of people who did not [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1516.92s)]
*  immigrate to the country legally. And so, you know, it's just, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1521.8400000000001s)]
*  it's a pathetic, it's a pathetic attempt to kind of [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1525.92s)]
*  rewrite history and, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1531.1200000000001s)]
*  and let everybody else off the hook, even though by its own logic, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1533.16s)]
*  it could just be another indictment of the entire system. So anyway, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1537.5600000000002s)]
*  it's just a goofy, a goofy claim and ridiculous logic to try to somehow [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1541.32s)]
*  say that, yeah, okay. Well, like, for example, right? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1546.3999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden wasn't, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1550.8s)]
*  he wasn't more senile on the border than he was on Ukraine. Right? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1553.1599999999999s)]
*  He was the same amount of senile for all of the policies and yet [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1557.8s)]
*  Ukraine funding kept happening, you know, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1562.52s)]
*  like all of these other policies went on. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1565.08s)]
*  And so why is it that this one policy was like affected by his, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1567.52s)]
*  his, his, him being senile when like, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1571.84s)]
*  clearly the same apparatus was at play there. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1575.96s)]
*  Why weren't people around Joe Biden just writing an executive order for him and [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1579.3999999999999s)]
*  getting him signed it. And, you know, and then again, of course, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1583.16s)]
*  much like with Biden senility in general, they're like, guys, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1586.8s)]
*  we, we were here, we watched the coverage of, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1591.8s)]
*  we know what Democrats were about it. All of this forever. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1596.6s)]
*  We have the video online. We can all find it. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1600.56s)]
*  People make amazing montages of this shit every single day that we all laugh at. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1604.08s)]
*  As we look at how fucking dishonest all you guys are, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1608.8799999999999s)]
*  you guys were sitting there saying that there is no crisis at the border. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1611.4799999999998s)]
*  So if the truth is that at the time you were going like, Oh my God, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1615.9599999999998s)]
*  this crisis is so horrible. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1618.9599999999998s)]
*  And Joe Biden's just so senile that he's not dealing with it. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1620.84s)]
*  What you told the American people was still that there is no crisis until, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1624.04s)]
*  you know, it was too late and you couldn't deny it. And, and then remember Rob, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1628.44s)]
*  because we covered, again, it's like, this is the thing. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1633.44s)]
*  We do a show four days a week. We cover this shit all the time. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1636.1200000000001s)]
*  Maybe we're not experts. Maybe we're not geniuses, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1639.3600000000001s)]
*  but we do talk about this shit all the time. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1641.52s)]
*  And I'm definitely smart enough and know enough to remember that all of you guys [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1643.48s)]
*  blamed Donald Trump for the crisis. You said that it was him. It was, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1648.4s)]
*  it was he who killed the immigration bill in Congress that would have solved [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1652.6399999999999s)]
*  this thing. And we pointed out at the time that's bullshit. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1656.9599999999998s)]
*  The immigration bill was, was a monstrosity. It would have been terrible. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1659.52s)]
*  But regardless, all of you guys, you can't just pivot from, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1662.9599999999998s)]
*  this was Donald Trump's fault. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1666.4399999999998s)]
*  And he did this just to help his election campaign into now. Oh, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1667.6399999999999s)]
*  I guess it was Joe Biden's fault, but he was senile. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1671.1999999999998s)]
*  So no one's really to blame. It's so convenient, Rob, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1674.08s)]
*  the answer from Jake Tapper's book. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1677.6s)]
*  And what these guys are saying is that no one is really to blame except for all [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1679.76s)]
*  the people who are out of power. Now we could talk. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1684.32s)]
*  We could never blame them when they were in power, you see, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1687.32s)]
*  but now that they're out of power, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1690.6000000000001s)]
*  it's Joe Biden and his family and his close advisors. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1692.32s)]
*  Those were the culprits, you know, as soon as they're out of that, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1696.32s)]
*  it's so just like, it's so pathetic. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1699.68s)]
*  It's so pathetic because it's always like what the, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1702.76s)]
*  what the press is essentially guilty of is sucking up to power. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1705.52s)]
*  And always defending power. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1710.0s)]
*  And now they're trying to prove that wrong by trashing people once they're out [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1711.44s)]
*  of power, who they never would have trashed when they were in power. It's like, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1715.56s)]
*  sorry, that just solidifies the case against you. It doesn't help. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1719.64s)]
*  Well, sucking up to democratic or a, you know, part of the machine power, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1723.96s)]
*  they like criticizing Trump, but well, yeah, but the point is, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1728.52s)]
*  even when they were criticizing Trump, they were sucking up to the CIA. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1732.64s)]
*  They were sucking up that, you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1736.04s)]
*  Like they're still kind of like on the side of the power that they felt that he [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1737.6s)]
*  was a threat to. So yes, but yes, I get your point. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1741.3999999999999s)]
*  And just speaking to the absolute nonsense of what Jake Tapper is saying here, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1744.52s)]
*  you can watch hours of footage of Myer Carditis in front of Congress, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1748.04s)]
*  in front of the Senate going, the border is not a crisis. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1751.36s)]
*  And we are doing everything we can and we care. And we're trying. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1754.84s)]
*  Did he ever once make a statement of, well, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1758.1999999999998s)]
*  I just haven't gotten orders from Joe Biden or we need the following action to [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1760.76s)]
*  be taken. He never once made that claim. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1764.9199999999998s)]
*  The claim that he made was he lied through his teeth and he ran cover for what [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1767.32s)]
*  seemed to be someone in the deep state or the administration that wanted as many [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1771.68s)]
*  people coming over that border as possible. And so he spent hours. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1776.64s)]
*  I'm telling you, he was border Fauci. He was just lying through his teeth. No, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1779.8s)]
*  it's not a crisis, but we do care. We are working hard. We're doing our job. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1783.48s)]
*  That's simply not true. I have to speak for my department. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1788.1200000000001s)]
*  We are doing our part. And then you go, well, then why are the numbers? Look, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1790.92s)]
*  we're doing every, well, it's not working. No. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1793.52s)]
*  And they even tried to impeach him. But I mean, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1795.76s)]
*  this is, this is from two, three years ago, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1799.56s)]
*  but what Chappers saying here is just not true. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1802.2s)]
*  Well, by the way, and there's something that's different about immigration, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1805.24s)]
*  particularly with like birthright citizenship and just with the, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1809.72s)]
*  you know, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1815.3600000000001s)]
*  the lack of appetite by the American people for any type of like [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1815.64s)]
*  violence within the United States of America, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1820.16s)]
*  where it is almost like, I think in some way it's like [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1824.5600000000002s)]
*  immigration and the death penalty are like the most permanent of government [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1829.24s)]
*  policies. You know, like you could, if you, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1834.0800000000002s)]
*  look, if you imprison someone falsely, you, okay, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1839.48s)]
*  you took that, that time from them. There's a permanence there. But you know, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1843.8400000000001s)]
*  you can release that person. You can clear their name. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1848.1200000000001s)]
*  You can even compensate them for the time that they were locked up. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1851.0s)]
*  If you have a bad tax policy, you can issue rebates, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1854.04s)]
*  you know, you like, there are, there are things, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1858.96s)]
*  there are government policies that you can theoretically undo. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1860.68s)]
*  Maybe not in totality, but like to some degree, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1865.08s)]
*  but like the death penalty, you can't, you know, you kill somebody, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1868.9199999999998s)]
*  they get exonerated by DNA evidence 15 years later and you just go, ah, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1872.96s)]
*  shit, we killed the guy, you know? And in some senses, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1877.56s)]
*  immigration policy is similar to that. You know, it's like you, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1882.24s)]
*  you're simply never going to be able to deport everybody who came in [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1886.28s)]
*  illegally. And, um, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1891.24s)]
*  and I don't even think the Trump administration is trying. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1894.08s)]
*  I think they've kind of given up on, on that idea if they ever even believed in [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1896.08s)]
*  it. Um, but there is something where you go like, look, man, when you just like, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1899.7s)]
*  when you against the will of the people, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1905.36s)]
*  just flood millions of people into a country, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1908.2s)]
*  like you changed that country in a way that will not be undone. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1911.12s)]
*  And when you did it like this, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1915.8799999999999s)]
*  where you're lying through your teeth as me orcas was, it's like, man, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1917.2s)]
*  there really should be some type of punishment for that. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1921.08s)]
*  That you get to sit there and just say, Oh, there is no crisis. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1923.68s)]
*  There is no crisis. This isn't happening. And then go, Oh yeah, totally happened. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1926.2s)]
*  But it was just cause this guy was senile. Anyway, moving on, like moving on, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1930.04s)]
*  you've, you know, like, I don't know, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1935.72s)]
*  it's like a permanent change to the country that you can't undo. Um, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1937.3999999999999s)]
*  and, uh, Bill Maher's response to this is pretty good. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1942.12s)]
*  It's just like another minute, but, uh, Bill Maher does hop on this in a decent [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1944.6799999999998s)]
*  way. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1948.24s)]
*  All right, let's play the rest of the clip. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1949.08s)]
*  I mean, I did, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1952.12s)]
*  I mentioned this during the show that our governor here recently reversed one of [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1952.6799999999998s)]
*  the policies we had here, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1957.1999999999998s)]
*  which was free medical care to undocumented migrants, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1958.3999999999999s)]
*  which pissed off a lot of people who think that that shouldn't be happening, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1962.12s)]
*  that, you know, we should take care of our own. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1966.08s)]
*  And that's why our taxes are so high. Uh, and you know, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1967.64s)]
*  it was a rather generous policy you got [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1970.88s)]
*  as someone who wasn't even a legal citizen, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1976.48s)]
*  including like being driven to appointments. I think I read now, I mean, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1978.52s)]
*  if that's something that a state like California, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1984.16s)]
*  because right on the border of Mexico is offering, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1987.04s)]
*  can you blame people for pouring over? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1989.28s)]
*  I love all these changes that Newsom's doing the conversion on the road to [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1991.64s)]
*  Des Moines. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1994.56s)]
*  Somebody's [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=1996.0s)]
*  can pause it there for a second. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2000.68s)]
*  This to me was the most incredible moment of the whole thing is that did Jake [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2002.56s)]
*  Tapper have the nerve to just go, by the way, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2008.56s)]
*  I agree with what Jake Tapper is saying. He's absolutely right. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2013.2s)]
*  But the unmitigated nerve of Jake Tapper to claim that, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2017.76s)]
*  oh yeah, this guy, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2022.88s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, Oh, his conversion on the road to Des Moines for those people who [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2024.52s)]
*  don't get the reference. Iowa is the first primary in the presidential elections. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2028.48s)]
*  And so he's saying, Oh yeah, you know, he's, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2032.48s)]
*  Oh, now that he wants to run for president, all of a sudden he's waking up. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2034.88s)]
*  But Jake Tapper, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2038.72s)]
*  go look at your coverage of this. While Joe Biden was still, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2041.88s)]
*  while Joe Biden was still in the white house and the plan was to run him once [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2045.8000000000002s)]
*  again, you were not only were you not covering any of this, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2049.84s)]
*  you were actively demonizing people who were telling the truth about it. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2053.2799999999997s)]
*  Your entire network made up ridiculous justifications about [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2058.2799999999997s)]
*  cheap fakes and sharp as attack and all this shit. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2063.08s)]
*  So don't sit here for a second and then criticize that guy for making a, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2066.96s)]
*  this conversion on the road, on the road to Des Moines. Okay. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2072.2s)]
*  That being said, Jake Tappers hypocrisy aside, he is right. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2076.4s)]
*  I mean, it is so hilarious that like, I don't, you know, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2080.92s)]
*  obviously there are individual people who are involved and these people are [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2086.04s)]
*  concerned with their own self-interest. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2091.7999999999997s)]
*  It is crazy to me that anybody looking at this wouldn't go, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2095.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2100.3199999999997s)]
*  we got to find someone new who doesn't have this nonsense on their track [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2101.64s)]
*  record. And this applies to Jake Tapper and it applies to, um, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2106.64s)]
*  to Gavin Newsom, you know, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2111.16s)]
*  like the idea that even if CNN wants to rebrand and say, look, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2113.12s)]
*  we're going to write a book, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2117.48s)]
*  we're going to do a big expose on the scandal that was the coverup of Joe [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2118.7999999999997s)]
*  Biden's senility. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2122.64s)]
*  Wouldn't you think that has to come with like a new anchor who we just brought [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2123.8799999999997s)]
*  in and we're going to, you know, frame him as like, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2128.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm a no nonsense truth teller. So Jake Tappers out, but I'm in, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2131.8399999999997s)]
*  and let me tell you the truth that he wouldn't tell you, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2136.16s)]
*  but you can't just have the guy who was doing his bidding, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2138.88s)]
*  turn around and say, now that you know, it's, it's all this shit. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2142.28s)]
*  I said this on the members only episode, but it's all this shit. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2146.4s)]
*  Stephen A Smith, Jake Tapper, like Gavin Newsom, all these guys, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2148.76s)]
*  this in this game, crack record is everything. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2154.6s)]
*  That's what you're judged on your track record. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2159.88s)]
*  That's what me and you are judged on Rob on our track record, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2162.6s)]
*  on what of the major issues we've gotten right over the last few years. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2165.6s)]
*  And in our case, it's all of them, but in their case, it's none of them. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2169.16s)]
*  And I'm sorry, but it doesn't like to come out now. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2173.68s)]
*  It's like Stephen A Smith. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2177.44s)]
*  It's like sitting there being a good little democratic foot soldier the entire [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2178.8399999999997s)]
*  time. And he may be able to claim like one time he said, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2182.68s)]
*  Joe Biden does seem a little old or something like that, but you're, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2185.8399999999997s)]
*  you're sitting there. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2189.12s)]
*  And then what after Donald Trump wins every single swing state and the popular [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2190.12s)]
*  vote, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2195.3199999999997s)]
*  and then once the entire culture has shifted away from like the insane shit of [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2196.16s)]
*  the last few years, and then once the, you know, the, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2201.3599999999997s)]
*  the Republicans control the house and the Senate and the presidency and the [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2205.4s)]
*  Supreme court, then when the Democrats approval ratings are at 25%, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2208.96s)]
*  you'll come out and say, you know what? I'm going to say it. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2213.8399999999997s)]
*  And I don't care if anyone doesn't like it. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2216.7999999999997s)]
*  There's some problems with these Democrats. Okay. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2219.2799999999997s)]
*  That doesn't get you any street cred. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2222.2799999999997s)]
*  You got to say it when it actually meant something. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2224.3199999999997s)]
*  Anybody can say it after the fact, but like all this stuff with it, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2227.0s)]
*  it's unbelievable to me that they'd go, okay, yeah. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2230.8399999999997s)]
*  Our presidential candidate for next time, you'd understand the Democrats going, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2234.64s)]
*  yeah, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2238.16s)]
*  probably should be someone who doesn't support the taxpayers being [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2238.44s)]
*  forced to provide medical care for immigrants. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2243.24s)]
*  But like then it's gotta be a new guy. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2247.8399999999997s)]
*  You can't just have the same guy end the policy now. Like it's just too, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2250.84s)]
*  it's too ridiculous. No, no, like no [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2255.76s)]
*  thinking human can't see through this bullshit. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2260.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, do you want to jump in Rob or you want to go back to the club? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2265.88s)]
*  Uh, I don't think that there's much more from this, uh, clip to be played, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2269.6800000000003s)]
*  but I don't, I don't actually remember. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2272.8s)]
*  Let's jump in just for, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2274.6800000000003s)]
*  for a couple more seconds cause I feel like there was one more thing that I [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2275.6400000000003s)]
*  wanted to respond to. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2278.32s)]
*  Somebody's got to do it. I mean, this is what we were talking about. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2280.28s)]
*  Look, I, I'm, I'm, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2285.88s)]
*  I'm a Democrat who believes that healthcare is a human right. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2287.0s)]
*  But the bottom line is there are a lot of Americans who don't have healthcare [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2289.36s)]
*  and it's about to get a lot worse because of the bill that Republicans just [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2292.0400000000004s)]
*  passed in the middle of the night, 15 million Americans, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2295.44s)]
*  not illegal immigrants, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2298.8s)]
*  15 million Americans who are going to lose healthcare because of what Trump and [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2300.4s)]
*  the Republicans are doing. So we've got to keep that context in mind. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2304.36s)]
*  But the reason why people are pissed off is because a lot of people don't have [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2308.2400000000002s)]
*  good enough healthcare in America today. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2311.36s)]
*  But what the Republicans would say, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2312.76s)]
*  so probably we can pause there. He's, he's skirting what, uh, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2314.96s)]
*  the point was, which was clearly there was government policy that was [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2319.6400000000003s)]
*  incentivizing people to come over and that this is foolish. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2322.6s)]
*  If you're looking to have less immigration, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2326.08s)]
*  you can at least just make it less favorable for people to try and sneak in [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2328.4s)]
*  illegally. And, uh, of course, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2331.88s)]
*  they don't want to speak to the fact that there were democratic policies that [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2334.2000000000003s)]
*  were clearly incentivizing this behavior. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2337.16s)]
*  And so he just skirts it to a lefty talking point about healthcare for [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2339.68s)]
*  Americans. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2344.0s)]
*  Well, isn't it, um, isn't it so incoherent though, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2344.96s)]
*  to say that like this world, which is, you know, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2349.04s)]
*  how the left uses this, these, um, the idea of rights, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2352.7599999999998s)]
*  but they're referring to like positive obligations, whereas like, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2356.7999999999997s)]
*  all like natural rights theory always relied around, uh, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2360.2s)]
*  revolved around negative rights. Um, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2363.2s)]
*  so like the idea that nothing is owed to be provided to you, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2365.36s)]
*  a rights claim is that something shouldn't be done to you for exercising those [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2369.1200000000003s)]
*  rights. So like, you know, the, um, you, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2374.2400000000002s)]
*  you may have the right to, uh, defend yourself. You might, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2377.0800000000004s)]
*  the right to, uh, bear arms, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2380.2000000000003s)]
*  but no one's arguing that the government has an obligation to provide you a gun. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2382.36s)]
*  It's just that they can't stop you from going and getting a gun. Now, again, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2386.76s)]
*  the government does stop you from going and getting a gun in many cases. Um, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2391.2400000000002s)]
*  but regardless of that, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2395.08s)]
*  the free speech doesn't mean that they're handing you a speech of what you say [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2396.64s)]
*  that would do it. Right. Or, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2400.2799999999997s)]
*  or that they have to hand you a megaphone or that they have to publish you in a [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2402.36s)]
*  newspaper or that they have, right. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2406.6s)]
*  It's just that no one should stop you from exercising your rights. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2408.16s)]
*  So in that sense, yes, we believe in the right to healthcare. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2411.6s)]
*  Like you have the right to go find a doctor and you know, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2414.36s)]
*  trade his services for your money at an agreed upon price. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2418.36s)]
*  But the way this guy is saying it, right, as, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2422.7599999999998s)]
*  as lefties like to talk about it, if they go, well, he goes, look, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2425.12s)]
*  I'm a Democrat who believes that healthcare is a human right. Well, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2428.0s)]
*  in that case, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2431.32s)]
*  how would you be opposed to providing healthcare to illegal immigrants? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2433.2s)]
*  Are you saying you're for denying them a human right? Like, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2438.04s)]
*  what does this even mean? It's totally incoherent. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2442.48s)]
*  That's the only way that makes sense. Well, right. Exactly. So it's, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2444.64s)]
*  it's like, why would it be the case that you, if you believe it's a human right, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2447.56s)]
*  are you saying human rights are only for American citizens? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2451.32s)]
*  Because that's not how human rights are supposed to work. Or you're, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2454.32s)]
*  are you admitting to being guilty of crimes against humanity? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2457.4s)]

*  no, it is not simply the case that this is Americans being [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2466.0s)]
*  mad that they don't have good healthcare. Don't get me wrong. There's a, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2470.88s)]
*  there's lots of problems with the health insurance industry. I, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2476.1600000000003s)]
*  uh, it's all due to government intervention, but I'm, you know, like, I am, uh, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2481.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm not thrilled with how much it costs me to, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2485.2400000000002s)]
*  to ensure my family it's outrageous. Um, but we have good healthcare. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2489.72s)]
*  I do have good healthcare. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2494.68s)]
*  I still don't want my tax dollars being paid for illegal immigrants, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2496.2400000000002s)]
*  healthcare. And it's not because, um, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2500.08s)]
*  I'm angry that I don't have good healthcare and the government's taking care of [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2502.68s)]
*  them. I just, I simply think it's, um, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2506.2s)]
*  it's an outrage to force the American people to [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2508.96s)]
*  cover health expenses of a group of people who have not even been invited into [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2513.6400000000003s)]
*  the country. And their first act is coming in against our laws. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2518.8s)]
*  I've got that totally appalling and look like it's like charity is only [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2522.6s)]
*  noble if it's done voluntarily. And if you want to help somebody out, then sure, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2527.6s)]
*  go for it. But the fact is that most Americans, uh, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2532.2000000000003s)]
*  feel like we have our own problems. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2535.68s)]
*  We have lots of our own citizens who have lots of issues and that the fact that [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2539.2s)]
*  you're forcing the taxpayer to cover the healthcare of illegal immigrants before [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2544.0s)]
*  our own government is even addressing the problems of our own citizens is an [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2549.2s)]
*  outrage. It's appalling. And so it's just all whatever, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2553.04s)]
*  it's all just wrong and stupid. The issue isn't that, um, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2556.8799999999997s)]
*  that, you know, people are just like, well, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2561.3599999999997s)]
*  my healthcare is not even good. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2563.72s)]
*  So we can't provide them with good healthcare until my healthcare is good. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2565.08s)]
*  It's more like something it's more like the view that it is not a given that [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2568.48s)]
*  America has an obligation to take in the whole world. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2574.72s)]
*  If the world wants to come, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2578.9599999999996s)]
*  it's not anybody's birthright to, uh, to come to America. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2580.56s)]
*  And the idea that if you just come here illegally against the wishes of the [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2585.64s)]
*  American people that therefore not only do we owe you that, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2590.64s)]
*  but we also owe you some stuff on top of it is just fucking absurd. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2594.2799999999997s)]
*  It makes absolutely no sense. And by the way, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2598.6s)]
*  this is the truth for all positive rights claims, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2600.48s)]
*  like all of the claims of like housing as a human right or healthcare as a human [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2604.16s)]
*  right or all of this stuff. And this is by the way, something I've said for years. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2608.2799999999997s)]
*  Um, there are these different, uh, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2613.92s)]
*  kind of schools of thought and different camps of political ideologies. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2617.2s)]
*  Uh, there are, you know, like Alex, uh, uh, who I debated from, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2622.92s)]
*  from Cato, uh, who I just debated recently, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2627.6s)]
*  there are like libertarians who support open borders. Um, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2629.96s)]
*  now I don't agree with them. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2634.04s)]
*  I think they get the theory wrong and they get the policy wrong, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2635.48s)]
*  but it is at least to some degree a coherent worldview to say that like I'm for [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2638.64s)]
*  basically the government doing nothing in the economy, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2644.64s)]
*  either the government doing nothing or the government doing absolutely next to [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2649.24s)]
*  nothing. Um, not intervening in the economy, not taxing people, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2652.08s)]
*  not providing positive rights for people, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2655.92s)]
*  but I'm for an open government policy over an open borders policy. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2658.2799999999997s)]
*  There's at least some coherence to that. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2662.24s)]
*  I think there's more coherence to a libertarian policy that says we don't believe [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2664.48s)]
*  in, uh, unrestricted immigration, obviously, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2668.56s)]
*  but there is something about the left wing worldview where they'll say things [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2672.8s)]
*  like this, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2678.12s)]
*  where they believe in a lax immigration policy and they also believe that [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2679.04s)]
*  healthcare and housing and education are human rights. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2684.92s)]
*  And there is just, it is such a contradictory way of viewing the world. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2688.92s)]
*  It's like, it's, it's so you're telling me that the, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2695.7200000000003s)]
*  your policy view is that the world has a right to come here and also we, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2699.32s)]
*  the taxpayer have an obligation to provide them with a house and with education [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2705.6800000000003s)]
*  and a job and healthcare and all of these things. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2710.0400000000004s)]
*  Explain to me how that works because that is just like there is, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2713.32s)]
*  it is the most like what was interesting about this. If you remember, Rob, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2717.0800000000004s)]
*  there was this, um, there's this, uh, uh, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2720.84s)]
*  interview with Bernie Sanders was Ezra Klein was interviewing Bernie Sanders. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2724.0800000000004s)]
*  I believe it was in 2016, might've been 15, but I think it was 2016. I'm sorry. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2728.04s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Yes. Either 2016 or 2015. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2733.64s)]
*  It was when he was running for president against Hillary Clinton or right [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2736.24s)]
*  before. And he asked him about open borders and Bernie Sanders, uh, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2738.52s)]
*  cause he's an old school, you know, socialist. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2742.88s)]
*  He's not like one of these new woke kinds. He just goes open borders. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2745.88s)]
*  He goes, that's a Koch brother policy. And it was an Ezra Klein was like, no, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2751.2799999999997s)]
*  no, no, no. Like we're lefties. We like open borders. And he was like, what? No, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2755.88s)]
*  that's what the right wingers want. Open borders. He goes there. But in a way, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2759.88s)]
*  it just, it made so much more sense. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2765.48s)]
*  If you were a democratic socialist, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2768.6400000000003s)]
*  then of course you'd have to believe in strict immigration control. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2771.12s)]
*  How else could you? I mean, Rob, look, if you, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2774.88s)]
*  if you believe in, um, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2777.6s)]
*  unions and high minimum wage and healthcare as a natural [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2781.28s)]
*  right and education as a, as a human right and housing as a human right. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2786.0s)]
*  Well, how can you do all that when you have wide open borders? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2790.1200000000003s)]
*  You can only do all of that. Right? Like it's totally contradictory. Now, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2793.0s)]
*  that does not mean therefore the libertarian open borders advocates are right. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2797.8s)]
*  They are incorrect, but at least there's a coherence to their worldview. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2802.08s)]
*  Whereas like with these, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2806.36s)]
*  these democratic socialists who believe in open borders, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2807.96s)]
*  it's totally incoherent just makes absolutely no sense. All right, guys, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2810.48s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2814.4s)]

*  the 1990s when big corporations switched to cheap process seed oils. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2827.1600000000003s)]
*  Today seed oils make up to 20% of the average Americans daily [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2832.28s)]
*  calories. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2836.6800000000003s)]
*  And recent studies have linked seed oils to metabolic health issues and [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2837.52s)]
*  inflammation in the body. Massa decided to do something about it. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2841.72s)]
*  They created a tasty and delicious tortilla chip with just three ingredients [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2845.52s)]
*  and no seed oils with just three ingredients and no seed oils. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2849.7599999999998s)]
*  These chips don't only avoid all the bad stuff. They taste incredible. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2853.96s)]
*  Massa is crunchier, tastier and sturdier than other chips. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2858.2s)]
*  Doesn't break in your guac. You know what I mean? I like having a strong chip. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2861.96s)]

*  I want you to address the concerns of your colleagues, Senator Ron Johnson, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2978.36s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul. Why doesn't this bill do more to address the debt and deficit, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2982.8s)]
*  Mr. Speaker? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2987.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, listen, I agree with my good friend, Ron Johnson, for example, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2990.0400000000004s)]
*  a lot of the comments that he stated about government spending, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2993.84s)]
*  we have a north of $36 trillion federal debt right now, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=2996.6400000000003s)]
*  and it is the largest national security concern for the U S I am a fiscal hawk. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3000.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, many of my Republican colleagues in the house, uh, feel the same way, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3004.92s)]
*  but it did not, we didn't get in this situation overnight, Kristen. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3008.8s)]
*  It took us decades, many decades of Congress is a frankly mismanagement of the [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3011.96s)]
*  public fisc to get in this situation. And the last four years, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3016.52s)]
*  the Biden administration increased spending dramatically. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3019.68s)]
*  So it's going to take us a while to get out of it. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3022.04s)]
*  We can't flip a magic switch and reverse it overnight, but this [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3024.4s)]
*  already right there. Right direction. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3029.52s)]
*  Yes, you can. What is this? That we didn't get here overnight. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3032.88s)]
*  Therefore we can't flip a switch. Like, well, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3038.7200000000003s)]
*  actually you can, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3041.56s)]
*  you could just stop spending all of our goddamn money. Like, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3043.52s)]
*  it's just such a ridiculous like thing to sit here and be like, well, you know, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3048.28s)]
*  look, I agree with you. I'm a fiscal hawk. And in fact, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3051.96s)]
*  the fact that we're $37 trillion in debt, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3055.96s)]
*  this is our number one national security threat. Like, Oh, all right, great. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3058.0s)]
*  So then we're all on the same page here. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3062.76s)]
*  So we definitely shouldn't add to the debt then, right? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3064.56s)]
*  Cause it's our number one national security. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3068.08s)]
*  So he's going to sit here and say, listen, I agree with you. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3070.0s)]
*  The president agrees with you. Every Republican agrees. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3073.2000000000003s)]
*  We're all in agreement and sure we have control of the house, the Senate, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3076.84s)]
*  and the president say, but you know, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3080.88s)]
*  we got to add a little bit more to the data. You can't buy it and spend so much. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3083.8s)]
*  Can't just turn this thing around. Like, I don't know. Like it's, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3086.88s)]
*  it's on the level of being like, um, you know, you're like, Hey, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3089.96s)]
*  you're morbidly obese and you ate nothing from dusk till [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3094.0s)]
*  dawn or whatever. You ate nothing from morning to night. Let's say, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3098.84s)]
*  you did nothing but eat cheesecake. Like this is really bad policy. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3102.4s)]
*  And it's going to result in disaster. And you go, yeah, I'm with you. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3107.6800000000003s)]
*  It's the biggest threat to our body right now is that we're so morbidly obese. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3110.5600000000004s)]
*  And you go, yeah, but I noticed you just bought two more cheesecakes. And you go, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3114.04s)]
*  well, look, I mean, we ate a ton of cheesecake yesterday and we can't, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3117.84s)]
*  I can't just hit some magical button where we don't eat cheesecake today. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3120.96s)]
*  It's like, no, actually, yes, you can. You could just not have any more. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3124.1600000000003s)]
*  That is totally possible. But you're telling me if you were to say, Hey, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3127.96s)]
*  I can't just push some magical button where we pay off the $37 trillion in debt. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3131.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, okay, fine. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3135.32s)]
*  But you could definitely write a bill that doesn't add to [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3136.84s)]
*  it. It's just such a ridiculous argument. And I'm listening. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3141.84s)]
*  I'm as much as a cheesecake Hulk as anybody. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3145.88s)]
*  We just got to eat a little bit, just a couple more cakes. What are we, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3149.2000000000003s)]
*  what are we talking about here guys? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3152.6s)]
*  But you don't have to spend any more money. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3154.68s)]
*  Or in your cheesecake example, if you're caught that red handed, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3156.68s)]
*  you can at least go, well, for tomorrow, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3160.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm only ordering one cheesecake and we're making improvements here. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3162.24s)]
*  And we're going to work wheel down. But when you order, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3165.68s)]
*  if you ate two today and you're telling you, Hey, I know it's a problem. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3168.64s)]
*  And you're going to three tomorrow, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3171.64s)]
*  doesn't sound like you actually care about the problem. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3172.96s)]
*  And so for him to be up there and go, Oh yeah, I agree with all these people. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3175.4s)]
*  I'm a hawk just as much as they are. But at the moment, we just gotta, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3178.44s)]
*  we gotta spend more than we ever did. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3181.8s)]
*  And I can't tell you when we're ever going to ramp that down or make the [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3183.6800000000003s)]
*  correction. But now's just not the time. Doesn't, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3186.36s)]
*  doesn't sound like you're a fiscal hawk, my friend. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3189.36s)]
*  As I've said before, Rob, if DC had a motto, it would be now's not the time. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3192.28s)]
*  Now's never the time. The only thing. Yes. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3197.8s)]
*  When it comes to dropping bombs, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3202.32s)]
*  then it's always the time. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3205.6800000000003s)]
*  It's almost always the time to drop bombs on innocent people. But yeah, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3207.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, I'll say this. You had, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3210.32s)]
*  Donald Trump winning every swing state and the popular vote. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3214.1200000000003s)]
*  You had a major cultural shift, a major, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3217.48s)]
*  major cultural awakening to the corruption of government. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3220.76s)]
*  You had Doge come in, which was enormously popular, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3225.44s)]
*  and it was exposing all types of government corruption. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3229.1600000000003s)]
*  You have a Republican, you have a house and a Senate whose [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3232.96s)]
*  slim majorities, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3237.6400000000003s)]
*  but have majorities filled up by Republicans who all go off all day long about [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3238.84s)]
*  how they're against big government and therefore fiscal sanity. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3243.84s)]
*  Just like the speaker here said, he's a fiscal hawk. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3246.76s)]
*  Now is the time. Now might be the only time. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3250.6800000000003s)]
*  Now is the best time. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3254.6800000000003s)]
*  It's the best goddamn shot we'd have to actually have some meaningful reduction [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3256.6000000000004s)]
*  in the size and scope in government. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3261.36s)]
*  And the reason why we're not having that is because Mike Johnson loves big [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3263.16s)]
*  government and Donald Trump loves big government and the entire Republican [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3267.32s)]
*  establishment love big government. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3271.56s)]
*  That's why we're going to continue to have big government and don't let them [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3273.96s)]
*  fool you with any of this other bullshit. Sorry. Look, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3277.32s)]
*  and to the entire MAGA movement, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3280.96s)]
*  we're either just like the fucking Democrats or we're not. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3283.28s)]
*  We're either in a cult as well where they could, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3286.92s)]
*  where one day we'll repeat the line. Yes. Sharp as attack. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3289.56s)]
*  Joe Biden is sharp as attack. Joe Biden's so old and senile that Kamala Harris [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3293.36s)]
*  has to run. Yes. Kamala Harris is hope and joy yet. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3297.28s)]
*  Like we're either cult members like them or we're fucking independent critical [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3300.56s)]
*  thinkers who are allowed to tell the truth. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3304.96s)]
*  And the truth is that this was the absolute best time to actually cut some [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3306.92s)]
*  government spending. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3310.88s)]
*  And the reason it's not happening is because almost no one in the Republican [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3311.96s)]
*  party actually believes in that. And it's clear to say, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3316.08s)]
*  there's a few people, Rand Paul, Thomas Massey. Um, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3319.12s)]
*  I'll even give a, uh, what's his name? Who they, they mentioned here, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3323.64s)]
*  Ron Johnson. Okay. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3326.6s)]
*  He's not quite as much of a hawk as I'd like him to be, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3329.2s)]
*  but at least those guys do to some degree believe in cutting the size and [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3331.48s)]
*  scope of government. The rest of them simply don't. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3335.96s)]
*  And you're gonna call this thing a big, beautiful bill. It's, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3339.92s)]
*  it's just disgusting. And it's an, I'm sorry, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3342.84s)]
*  what Mike Johnson is saying here is just, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3345.44s)]
*  it's an insult to all of our intelligence. All right, let's, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3347.16s)]
*  let's keep playing it. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3351.44s)]
*  Bring it back just like a few seconds Natalie and let's play a little more from [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3352.28s)]
*  the clip before we wrap up. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3355.7200000000003s)]
*  Is the largest step forward in the right direction that Congress has ever made. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3357.88s)]
*  I liken this to an aircraft carrier. You don't turn an aircraft carrier on a dime. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3362.68s)]
*  It takes a mile of open ocean. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3366.2400000000002s)]
*  This is the biggest turn in that wheel that we would have had in generations. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3367.8s)]
*  And this is the first of a number of steps. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3372.16s)]
*  This is a key point. This is not the only reconciliation bill. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3374.84s)]
*  We're going to have a second budget reconciliation bill that follows after this. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3378.2400000000002s)]
*  And we're beginning next week, the appropriations process, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3382.0400000000004s)]
*  which is the spending bills for government. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3385.28s)]
*  And you're going to see a lot of the Doge cuts and a lot of this new fiscal [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3387.44s)]
*  restraint reflected in what Congress does next. So stay tuned. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3390.76s)]
*  This is just pause it right there for a second. Okay. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3394.48s)]
*  No, you won't. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3399.44s)]
*  We're both on record making our predictions now. No, you won't. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3400.4s)]
*  You will not see a lot of the Doge cuts reflected. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3406.56s)]
*  They'll find a way to spin it so that they can claim that some of them are, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3409.36s)]
*  but I'm sorry. Look again, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3412.92s)]
*  all of these examples of like it takes a long time to turn a ship around. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3414.88s)]
*  All right. The problem is like, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3421.84s)]
*  let's say you're in a car and you're doing 90 miles an hour and you're headed off [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3424.36s)]
*  of a cliff. Okay. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3429.92s)]
*  If I get behind the wheel and I step on the accelerator and now I push more on [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3432.52s)]
*  it and now we're doing 95 miles an hour, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3437.1600000000003s)]
*  I can't really claim that I'm turning it around. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3439.96s)]
*  And if spending is going up and the deficit's going up and the debt is going up, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3444.28s)]
*  then you're not turning the ship around. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3448.6400000000003s)]
*  You are accelerating in the direction of disaster. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3451.1600000000003s)]
*  That is not being a fiscal hawk and try to spin this any way you want to. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3455.1600000000003s)]
*  And look, I'm just, again, there's some younger people who listen to this show. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3458.92s)]
*  I have the benefit of a little bit of wisdom now that I'm getting old. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3463.08s)]
*  I've just been through this before. I've been through this every Republican in my [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3467.08s)]
*  lifetime. So I was born during the Ronald Reagan administration. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3472.08s)]
*  So I lived through a little bit as a baby of Ronald Reagan, but you know, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3477.28s)]
*  whatever. I was like five by the time he got out. But I, you know, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3481.32s)]
*  whatever I've read a lot about it. I know about Ronald Reagan, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3485.6800000000003s)]
*  George HW Bush was the second Republican president of my lifetime. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3488.7200000000003s)]
*  George W. Bush was the third. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3493.7200000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is the fourth and fifth depending on how you want to carve it up [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3495.52s)]
*  every single time spending went up, spending went up under Reagan, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3500.92s)]
*  under George HW Bush, under George W. Bush and under Donald Trump and under [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3505.96s)]
*  Donald Trump again. And not by a little major spending increases, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3509.36s)]
*  increases in entire new departments of entitlements were created. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3514.44s)]
*  I think of George W. Bush's Medicare part date. Okay. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3519.44s)]
*  No child left behind was created under a Republican president. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3522.6400000000003s)]
*  It's an every single time Rob, they got some story like this. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3527.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes, we're raising spending and adding to the debt and all of this, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3532.28s)]
*  but it's a big part of this huge ship being turned around. And believe me, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3535.32s)]
*  in the appropriations process, Rob, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3539.84s)]
*  that's where we're really going to get to cutting spending. No, you fucking won't. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3541.8799999999997s)]
*  You liar. You big government loving liar. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3547.04s)]
*  Not happening. All right, Rob, I'll give you the final word. And then let's, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3551.8399999999997s)]
*  uh, let's wrap up. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3555.0s)]
*  I think we thoroughly trashed the Republican party that seems to have zero [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3556.4s)]
*  interest in whatsoever at this point in time of, uh, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3560.72s)]
*  trying to actually cut spending. And, uh, now you know, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3564.08s)]
*  you had Elon Musk saying Doge is a movement. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3566.96s)]
*  They're going to continue my movement and, uh, they're making bold claims. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3569.36s)]
*  There was an interview with a JD Vance and he said that, uh, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3573.04s)]
*  we're absolutely going to be continuing Doge. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3576.3199999999997s)]
*  This was just the start of Doge and there just seems to be a lot of promises [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3578.36s)]
*  from the administration of, no, we're doing it. We're doing it. It's common. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3582.0s)]
*  It's common. Trust the plan. We're going to do it. But then, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3585.88s)]
*  as he got further and further along, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3589.44s)]
*  it doesn't seem like they're ever actually taking any actions towards what [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3591.48s)]
*  they're promising you. Yep. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3594.6s)]
*  So it's just like, that's the thing. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3596.28s)]
*  And then what they count on is that by the time it comes, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3597.84s)]
*  you'll already be, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3602.2000000000003s)]
*  this will be in the rear view mirror and you'll be infuriated about the latest [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3603.52s)]
*  progressive thing that they did. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3607.2000000000003s)]
*  And so you'll fall in line supporting the Republicans beside this. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3608.8s)]
*  But like right now, while it's being like, let's just be clear, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3611.6s)]
*  spending isn't getting cut. Epstein files aren't being released. Like the, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3615.4s)]
*  the, all of the, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3620.2000000000003s)]
*  these promises are just not happening and they're not happening for a reason. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3621.68s)]
*  And it's because the Republicans don't want it to, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3626.56s)]
*  they don't actually believe in this stuff and whatever that, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3629.72s)]
*  let that prediction bear out. Let's see if Mike Johnson's right. Or if, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3632.68s)]
*  if we're right about that. But yeah, this is, I've just seen this game. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3636.16s)]
*  I've seen this movie too many times and just bullshit. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3640.3199999999997s)]
*  One more thing on that is that for the, for the Trump loyalists, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3643.64s)]
*  I think for people that are actually concerned with these things, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3646.92s)]
*  if there's enough public interest in them, you might force their hand. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3649.84s)]
*  Believe me, if no one, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3653.08s)]
*  if no one doesn't shut up about and these Republicans actually get punished and [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3654.0s)]
*  start looking like they're expanding the debt more. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3658.08s)]
*  And it's funny that NBC gets to be on there. Aren't we concerned about the debt? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3660.52s)]
*  But the Republicans are almost falling into this trap where they're never going [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3664.7999999999997s)]
*  to be able to talk about debt again. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3668.04s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to talk about the deep state again. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3669.7599999999998s)]
*  And if you were looking for these things to actually be fixed, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3672.2s)]
*  Trump is in office now and you go, Hey, I'm looking for this to happen. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3675.7999999999997s)]
*  They might do it. But if I think of you to stand around and go trust the plan, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3679.08s)]
*  trust the plan. No, you can't criticize them. They're better than the Dems. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3682.56s)]
*  I think it's a lot safer for them to just not touch any of these things. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3685.84s)]
*  And so they won't. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3689.24s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. All right. That's our show for today. Thank you guys for, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZzVS0ZiHE&t=3690.72s)]
