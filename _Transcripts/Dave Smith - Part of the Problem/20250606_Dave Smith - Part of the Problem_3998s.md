# Dave Smith | Trump VS. Musk | Part Of The Problem 1272
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4)
*  Hello, hello, what's up everybody? Welcome to a special episode of part of the problem, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=0.0s)]
*  special day and time. We moved this episode over because I wasn't able to get one out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=13.32s)]
*  on Wednesday. And you know, every now and then things really work out where there's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=19.0s)]
*  a good time to have a new episode. Okay, so what can we say here? It was we had a good run, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=24.6s)]
*  guys. We had a good run. Of course, I want to talk today about the rather bizarre and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=33.32s)]
*  extreme fallout between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. I, you know, I've got a lot to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=43.8s)]
*  say about this. And so I'm struggling a little bit on like what order to even go in or how to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=53.24s)]
*  even approach breaking all of this down. So bear with me here. I'm just going to kind of we're all [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=59.96s)]
*  going to figure this out together. And we'll see what order we end up doing it in. So the first [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=64.52s)]
*  thing I would say is, and this is something we've talked about quite a bit on the show, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=71.4s)]
*  is that the Trump coalition for Donald Trump 2.0 for for Donald Trump 47 has been [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=76.60000000000001s)]
*  a very interesting coalition. It's made up largely of former Democrats, including Donald Trump [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=89.4s)]
*  himself, who's a former Democrat. But obviously, going into this election cycle, Donald Trump put [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=98.04s)]
*  together a coalition that was very different from the one he had in 2016, very different from the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=106.84s)]
*  one he tried to put together in 2020. People like Elon Musk and Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard. And [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  you know, there was just a huge group of people who supported Donald Trump this time who did not [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=119.72s)]
*  support him in 2016 or 2020. And that also includes a group of like tech billionaires who were not [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=127.4s)]
*  his allies, historically, but did support him in this presidential campaign. And, you know, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=135.16s)]
*  I've been saying this for for about a year now, just about I think it's a, it was just about a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=143.16s)]
*  year ago that Donald Trump got shot. And maybe a little less like 10, 10 months ago that Donald [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=149.24s)]
*  Trump got shot, and Elon Musk threw a support behind him. So through this whole time, what you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  know, one of the things I've been saying, and I'm certainly the far from the only one to make this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=162.84s)]
*  point, it's a fairly obvious observation was that this coalition had a window, you know, it there [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=167.4s)]
*  were going to be cracks in it eventually, and there'll still probably will be more cracks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=175.24s)]
*  Things are going to change as 2028 gets closer. And some people might be competing for positions, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=180.12s)]
*  there might be a competition in which direction the kind of broader MAGA movement or the maha [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=187.72s)]
*  movement is going to go. And you look, you've just got you can see the writing on the wall, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=194.28s)]
*  you've got people like, say, Bobby Kennedy, who really does not have that much fundamentally in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=200.28s)]
*  common with Donald Trump. And in fact, the health stuff that Bobby Kennedy is all, you know, is his [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  big deal seems to almost be something Donald Trump just kind of picked up. Like, why not? I don't [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=216.84s)]
*  really have a coherent health policy. So why not go with the Make America Healthy Again thing and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=222.04s)]
*  combine forces? But there's no like, there's no obvious permanent reason for them to be in a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=227.0s)]
*  coalition together, aside from the fact that he gave Bobby Kennedy the Health Department. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=235.48s)]
*  JD Vance himself was once a never Trump or there's just a lot of there's a lot of people who [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=239.88s)]
*  essentially are unified by or were unified by their opposition to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=245.56s)]
*  and the Democratic agenda. That's that in general in politics, it works very well as a unifying force [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=253.32s)]
*  to be against a regime while that regime is in power. But once they're not in power anymore, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=265.0s)]
*  it's just that that isn't quite strong enough glue to hold coalition together. So this is kind [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  of like a broader, you know, point. With Elon Musk and Donald Trump more specifically, I certainly [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=281.48s)]
*  thought it was maybe not inevitable, but quite likely that it would end in a in this way, or [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=290.44s)]
*  something similar to this. I didn't think it would get quite so fiery quite so fast. But of course, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=297.72s)]
*  it's it's important to remember with all this stuff that there there were tremendous efforts [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=303.16s)]
*  from the very beginning of Donald Trump's second term to undermine that relationship. And there was [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=310.2s)]
*  it was an attempt by the corporate media and the establishment of I think both political parties [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=318.12s)]
*  to kind of drive a wedge between the two of them. All this talk on this ridiculous talk that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=325.24s)]
*  people were saying, you know, is Elon Musk really the president? All of this stuff was always [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=330.76s)]
*  designed to drive a wedge between Trump and Elon Musk, by the way, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=335.08s)]
*  you got to say, for all the people who were saying Elon Musk is the real president, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  this looks pretty bad for them. I'm not holding my breath that we'll get apologies from any of them [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=344.76s)]
*  anytime soon. But it does make that look like pretty ridiculous that you thought Elon Musk was [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=350.68s)]
*  the one who really was in charge of the White House seeing as how he's now not only out at Doge, but [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=356.28s)]
*  is is now I would imagine an enemy of Donald Trump's. So [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  look, there's a lot going on here that we don't know for sure what's happening. And of course, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=370.76s)]
*  this is fertile ground for speculation. Now I'm not against that. I think it's reasonable for [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=377.48s)]
*  people to speculate about what might be going on. Particularly when there's details like Elon Musk [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=381.8s)]
*  shows up with a black eye to the White House just recently, which is just strange. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  Which is just strange. Maybe that's nothing. He said that I think he said it was one of his kids [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=392.28s)]
*  gave it to him. And I got little kids and there's you rough house sometimes they come sprinting at [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=398.35999999999996s)]
*  you and you might catch a head to the head or something. It's possible. It also just seems a [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=404.52s)]
*  little bit strange. Okay, so there's some stuff like that. I will say that, again, this is still [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=410.44s)]
*  also in the realm of speculating. There certainly is something that happens when you get men who are [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=417.48s)]
*  at this level where, you know, a level where Donald Trump and Elon Musk exist that like ego comes into [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  play. There's a certain alpha energy that men at that level tend to have. And it's not necessarily [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=435.8s)]
*  like alpha in the sense of like a personality type. Because certainly I don't think Elon Musk is like, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=443.72s)]
*  you know, it's not exactly what you'd think of as like an alpha male. But he's the richest man who's [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=448.44s)]
*  ever existed in the history of the world. And he had a huge role in getting Donald Trump reelected. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=454.52s)]
*  And just in general with men, when you're playing at that level, I think it's almost impossible for [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=461.24s)]
*  there not to be like a certain level of ego that comes with that. That's not a knock on Elon Musk [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=467.64s)]
*  or a knock on Donald Trump. I think that's just more the way men work. And you are going to find [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=472.44s)]
*  that level of ego at that level of like apex domination in every tribe throughout human history. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=481.16s)]
*  That's just, I think, part of who we are as a species. And, you know, so I'm sure there's a lot [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=489.4s)]
*  of that going on. Now, I will say, to start, there's a lot of speculation about what [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=496.44s)]
*  Elon Musk's real motivations are. And I'll be the first to acknowledge that. I don't know. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=505.64s)]
*  You know, I don't know. It's hard enough in this world to know the true motivations of people who [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=513.32s)]
*  you know very well. It's a challenge to know your own true motivations. Like the human psychology [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=520.04s)]
*  is complicated. You know, it's like I could sit here and say, you know, before I go on a big show [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=525.96s)]
*  or something like that, like, well, my motivation is just to tell the truth. And I believe that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=532.36s)]
*  And certainly that is true to some degree. But then, of course, if you're being honest, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=539.0s)]
*  is my motivation to make money and to get more recognition on myself and all of these things? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  It's like, oh, yeah, I guess all of that is kind of part of my motivations, if I'm being completely [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=550.12s)]
*  honest, because it's even a challenge to understand your own motivations. It's a challenge [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=554.84s)]
*  to understand your wife's motivations, your best friend's motivations. Now you're talking about [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=559.24s)]
*  people you don't personally know, and the whole world is speculating on their motivations. It's [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=563.4s)]
*  just a very, you know, it's something we don't know. Now, I've seen people put forth the idea [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=568.44s)]
*  that Elon Musk bought Twitter because he wanted to collect the data, that Elon Musk was involved in [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=576.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's in getting Donald Trump elected, because he thought it would help further his [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=584.2s)]
*  business interests. You know, that he's closely associated with Peter Thiel and like the Palantir [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=590.2s)]
*  thing, which by the way, I don't know nearly enough about I do know that the company was [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=596.2s)]
*  essentially started by the CIA as like a data collection company. And my, my general rule of [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=600.2s)]
*  thumb is if anything was started by the CIA, it ought to be abolished. I'm not saying that's a [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=606.36s)]
*  100% ironclad law, but it's a rule of thumb. Anyway, perhaps some of that is true. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=611.48s)]
*  Maybe not. In general, I think when it comes to these types of things, you could always [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  endlessly speculate about other people's motivations. I tend to try to judge people based [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=629.16s)]
*  off what they're doing, based off their actions and their stated motivations, unless they give [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=636.6s)]
*  you reason not to. It just seems to me to be a better way to move through the world than to [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=642.2s)]
*  constantly be wondering what people's secret motivations are, especially if you don't have [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=649.96s)]
*  good evidence to believe them. And so, and also keeping in mind what I just said, that you could [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=653.88s)]
*  have all of these motivations. Like it's not, they're not necessarily in conflict. So I would [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=659.96s)]
*  say that Elon Musk is outrageously successful and outrageously rich. And I don't know if it, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=666.0400000000001s)]
*  if it quite makes sense to me that his motivations were purely more power and control and money and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=676.84s)]
*  things like that. I don't know. I have a tough time believing that there wasn't anything to what [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=684.12s)]
*  he was saying, but who knows? The bottom line is essentially this. Here's what happened. And [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=688.68s)]
*  by the way, I'm open to someone being corrected if I'm getting something about the timeline wrong [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=695.64s)]
*  here. That is not the part of this that I'm most married to. But essentially, as we, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=701.3199999999999s)]
*  as we've been talking about for, for a while on the show, Doge failed. Now I don't blame Elon [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=709.24s)]
*  Musk for that. I think Elon Musk gave it a good go. He gave it the old college try. I think there [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=719.88s)]
*  were lots of reasons why Doge was destined to fail. I've talked about this since the idea of [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=727.72s)]
*  Doge was first floated out. And, you know, look, you're, you're going, you're, you know, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=734.6s)]
*  when Elon Musk could just say things like, we're going to find $2 trillion to cut and the Pentagon [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=742.52s)]
*  isn't off limits and all this, and this sounds really nice. And look, man, you're the boss of [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=747.8000000000001s)]
*  your companies and you, you're a genius and you're like, Hey, I've figured this out. We're going to [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=752.12s)]
*  use AI. We're going to use these young genius guys to go do this. It's like, okay. But what, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=759.08s)]
*  what you're actually talking about here is attacking the biggest honeypot in the history [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=764.92s)]
*  of the world. You're going after the most entrenched power in the history of the world. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=772.36s)]
*  And by the way, at the top of this entrenched power is killers, right? Like people who are [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=780.2s)]
*  quite comfortable killing large numbers of people to get more power, get more money. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=788.36s)]
*  That's a dangerous game and it's one that's kind of unlikely to be successful. And as we've seen [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=796.6800000000001s)]
*  over the last few months, while many of the latest public narratives that the regime uses [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=802.28s)]
*  have been weakened or destroyed or abandoned by many people, that does not mean that the, that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=812.68s)]
*  people, there's no more power. It doesn't mean that they have no other tools at their disposal. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=819.4s)]
*  And let me tell you, going into Washington, DC, talking about cutting trillions of dollars, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=824.12s)]
*  you're going to make some enemies in that town and some pretty powerful enemies. So Doge failed [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=828.5999999999999s)]
*  and it ultimately failed partially because of the swamp and partially because Donald Trump kind of [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=834.92s)]
*  turned his back on it. Donald Trump really wasn't that committed to cutting spending. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=842.36s)]
*  And this is something we should have known from his first term. And in fact, whatever it was, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=847.16s)]
*  Doge comes out and finds some money that they've recommended we cut. And then Donald Trump turns [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=852.36s)]
*  around and asked for a trillion dollar defense budget and just, which would have been more than [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=858.6s)]
*  the cuts that Doge had proposed, which never even got put into place anyway. All right, guys, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=865.24s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Sheath Underwear, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=870.36s)]

*  Okay, so as we know, there is this big, beautiful bill, this awful spending bill that Donald Trump [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=914.52s)]
*  is getting behind. And everyone who's good in Washington, DC, which is a small handful of people [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=924.52s)]
*  have opposed it. You know, so Thomas Massey and Rand Paul and Ron Johnson and whoever else [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=931.88s)]
*  have been against this bill. And then of course, Donald Trump, being Donald Trump, he has to like, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=936.68s)]
*  aim all his fire at these guys, the best guys in Washington, the only ones who really stand for [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=945.3199999999999s)]
*  draining the swamp and having an America first foreign policy and all this stuff that Donald [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=951.8s)]
*  Trump runs on, but doesn't govern on, he starts attacking those guys. Now, I noticed yesterday, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=956.04s)]
*  we talked about this briefly in the members only episode yesterday, but this is before all the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=964.5999999999999s)]
*  shit really went down. Elon Musk, now after he's, you know, announced that he's leaving Doge, he's [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=968.12s)]
*  out of the White House, has a suspicious black eye, but whatever, that's neither here nor there, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=976.52s)]
*  I guess, or maybe it is, but we don't know. So Elon Musk now starts on Twitter, starts backing up [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=981.96s)]
*  Rand Paul and Thomas Massey and talking about how terrible this bill is. Now, here is really [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=990.4399999999999s)]
*  where things kind of escalate a bit. So I thought, as I'm watching this on Twitter [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=998.6s)]
*  the other day, I thought to myself, well, okay, Elon's going for it here and this is already [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1008.52s)]
*  enough to kind of ruin the relationship with Elon Musk and Donald Trump. And this is, you know, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1015.4s)]
*  Donald Trump, when he sets his targets on somebody and that's the bad person now, that's the enemy, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1022.92s)]
*  already you being on the side of the enemy is, that's, I think, in Trump's world a declaration [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1030.68s)]
*  of war. Now, I think that's unfair, obviously, especially in this situation where Elon Musk is [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1036.76s)]
*  right and Rand Paul is right and Thomas Massey is right. They're correct on the issue and Elon Musk, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1042.6s)]
*  and you have to imagine, this is why I kind of prefaced with the stuff I was saying about [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1049.32s)]
*  an ego, I don't mean this in a negative way, Elon Musk is not a guy who I don't think you're going [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1052.84s)]
*  to be able to tell you got to bite your tongue on an issue you really believe in, that you have made [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1060.36s)]
*  your central issue of what you stand for. That's too, that is not a reasonable ask of Donald Trump. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1066.28s)]
*  I'm not saying he actually asked that, but I'm saying it's not reasonable for that to allow you [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1077.08s)]
*  to get upset. Now, what I will say, and again, like I said before, I'm open to anyone correcting [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1082.12s)]
*  me on the timeline here, but this is as far, you know, because it's not like you go in one place [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1086.9199999999998s)]
*  and it has like the whole thing laid out. It's like, Elon's firing tweets, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1091.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's making comments, Elon's firing more tweets, you know, it's like, maybe I'm getting [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1095.08s)]
*  something wrong, but I did think what I noticed was that, okay, the first major escalation [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1099.9599999999998s)]
*  came from Elon Musk. And the escalation that came from Elon Musk was that he went from not only [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1107.48s)]
*  backing Rand Paul and backing Thomas Massey and coming out in opposition to the big, beautiful bill, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1115.48s)]
*  God, what a... Okay, but not only that, but then he had a post where he encouraged people to call [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1123.08s)]
*  their representatives to tell them not to support the bill. Now, look, again, I want to be clear on [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1131.24s)]
*  this. This was an escalation by Elon Musk. However, it's fair game. Like, it is a bad bill. He's against [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1139.24s)]
*  it for principled reasons. He's correct to be against it. And he has every right to encourage [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1147.88s)]
*  people to call their congressmen, to call their senators and encourage them to vote against it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1155.5600000000002s)]
*  There is nothing wrong in him doing that. However, this is politics. And you do have to recognize [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1160.6799999999998s)]
*  that once you do that, you are now... You are actively opposing the president's agenda. And [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1168.6s)]
*  you're not some guy who's doing this. You're a guy with... I mean, how many Twitter followers [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1179.1599999999999s)]
*  does Elon Musk have? It's like over 100 million or something, right? Let me see. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1185.4s)]
*  Here, hold on one second. I'll look it up right now. Elon Musk has 220 million Twitter followers. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1193.16s)]
*  So you're now broadcasting from the largest platform to oppose the president's legislative [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1200.8400000000001s)]
*  agenda. Now, just in politics, that's how you make enemies. Now, again, I'm not knocking Elon [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1209.3200000000002s)]
*  Musk for that. He's right to do it. But this is where this becomes a confrontation. And you [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1214.12s)]
*  have to kind of say to yourself, well, on one hand, Elon Musk decided to make himself [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1223.6399999999999s)]
*  in a political enemy of the president. On the other hand, and I would argue here, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1231.3999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk has done a lot for President Trump. I think this is one of the things that... What [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1237.0s)]
*  comes down to this here is that both... You can kind of see... And again, this is speculation to [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1243.24s)]
*  some degree, but you could see where in both of these guys' minds, they could feel like they've [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1248.04s)]
*  done a lot for the other person. However, in reality, if we're being fair here, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1253.48s)]
*  Elon did a lot more for Donald Trump than Donald Trump did for Elon Musk. I mean, yes, Donald [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1264.28s)]
*  Trump brought Elon Musk into the White House, and yes, he let him run Doge. But again, Doge never [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1269.4s)]
*  had any real power. Most of the things that he wanted to do, Donald Trump didn't do. And then [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1274.8400000000001s)]
*  by asking for a trillion dollar defense budget and by throwing his support behind this bill, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1281.5600000000002s)]
*  he essentially undid all of whatever Doge may have done. And so still, it's just... Look, it's hard [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1288.44s)]
*  for me to look at what Donald Trump did by giving Elon Musk Doge and go, oh my God, he did so much [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1296.6s)]
*  for Elon Musk. The truth is, Elon Musk took an enormous pay cut. He was getting paid nothing [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1304.1999999999998s)]
*  by Doge. And I'd imagine every minute that Elon Musk is working, he's making millions of dollars. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1312.52s)]
*  So he's sacrificing quite a bit to do the Doge thing. He's also getting Tesla's keyed and all [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1318.4399999999998s)]
*  this other shit. Elon Musk put himself in a position to take a lot, a lot of abuse by supporting [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1324.12s)]
*  Donald Trump. Now, Donald Trump could sit here and say, you know, I've been impeached. I've had the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1334.84s)]
*  legal system weaponized against me. I've been tried. I've been convicted. I've had people try [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1344.36s)]
*  to kill me, all the things that Donald Trump's been through. Elon didn't do any of that to [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1350.1999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump. Elon came on board after all of that had happened to Donald Trump. And it is hard. Now, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1354.76s)]
*  I'm not going to quite make the statement that Elon Musk did more for Donald Trump than any [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1361.6399999999999s)]
*  human being has ever done for a presidential candidate. But [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1370.36s)]
*  you know, like, a few really brilliant historians could have a very, you know, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1377.6399999999999s)]
*  like it might be the case. Now, maybe you want to argue that like, if you go, you know, the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1384.84s)]
*  Rockefellers helped Woodrow Wilson even more and in the old system where everything was completely [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1390.52s)]
*  controlled, having like the Morgans or the Rockefellers on board with you or something [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1395.96s)]
*  like that would have been more powerful. But you'd have to go to something like that. And there's [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1400.1200000000001s)]
*  certainly I don't think there's anything in my lifetime that even comes close. I mean, Elon Musk, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1405.32s)]
*  first of all, he I don't think you can overstate how important for Donald Trump it was that Elon [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1411.64s)]
*  Musk bought Twitter. But you know, if you could try to put yourself back in this place just a [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1419.32s)]
*  few years ago, Donald Trump had been banned, permanently banned from Twitter. Donald Trump, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1424.76s)]
*  not only was he banned, but so many of his his most vocal supporters were banned. The the entire [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1431.96s)]
*  kind of cultural constraints on speech had reached a peak of sorts. I mean, Donald Trump after [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1439.56s)]
*  particularly through the year 2020 with COVID, but really, when it came to like the Donald Trump's [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1451.8s)]
*  challenging of the 2020 election, January 6, all of these things, if you remember, the media [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1461.08s)]
*  was starting to do this thing where they wouldn't even cover Donald Trump, they they used to straight [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1468.84s)]
*  up, they'd be covering a speech and then cut away and say, we're not going to play the rest of this [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1474.36s)]
*  speech because he's making up ridiculous lies like they they wouldn't even let the American people [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1479.08s)]
*  hear the former president, or it was actually currently still the president when they first [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1483.8799999999999s)]
*  started doing this, they wouldn't let him hear the president make his case about why the last [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1489.96s)]
*  election was fraudulent. Think about how crazy that is. Twitter kicked off the sitting president [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1495.96s)]
*  of the United States of America. This is so wild. I mean, I know this was five years ago or whatever, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1502.36s)]
*  but it's so wild that this actually happened. Imagine living in a world where the sitting [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1507.96s)]
*  commander in chief cannot tweet because Twitter has decided that like what he says is too dangerous [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1514.44s)]
*  or something like that. But so this was the situation Donald Trump is in, an outgoing [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1522.6000000000001s)]
*  president who is more handcuffed than any president in modern American history. All right, guys, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1528.1200000000001s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Quince, a great clothing [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1533.88s)]
*  brand. Quince has all the things you actually want to wear this spring, like organic cotton silk [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1539.8000000000002s)]
*  polos, European linen beach shorts, and pants that work from everything to backyard hangs to [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1545.24s)]
*  nice dinners. The best part is that everything is priced 50 to 80% less than what you'd find from [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1551.0800000000002s)]
*  similar brands. You'll be looking great and saving tons. I will tell you personally, I love Quince. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1557.64s)]
*  It's an excellent clothing brand. I just got a beautiful hoodie from them that I love. I was [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1563.56s)]
*  just wearing it on the show the other day. Definitely go check them out. Elevate your closet with [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1567.6399999999999s)]
*  Quince. Go to quince.com slash P O T P for free shipping on your orders and 365 day returns. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1572.6s)]
*  That's Q U I N C E dot com slash P O T P for free shipping and 365 day returns quince.com [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1581.08s)]
*  slash P O T P. All right, let's get back on the show. So Elon Musk buys Twitter. After [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1590.44s)]
*  Donald Trump gets shot, Elon Musk throws his support behind Donald Trump. Elon Musk gives [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1597.3200000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump $300 million or so is a huge, huge contributor to his campaign. Not only that, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1601.8s)]
*  there's just no question that Elon changed like him getting on board with Donald Trump was a huge [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1610.04s)]
*  change in this massive cultural shift because you had Zuckerberg backing down and then getting on [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1619.16s)]
*  board. You had essentially like all these different platforms, YouTube and all of this stuff, they all [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1627.72s)]
*  kind of followed suit. Then you had Elon Musk opened up like a world of tech billionaires [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1633.72s)]
*  who would now openly be behind Donald Trump in a way that they never would have before. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1641.96s)]
*  I'm just saying when you look at it, Elon Musk did a ton to back Donald Trump. And if we're being [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1647.08s)]
*  completely fair here, this is after the assassination attempt against Donald Trump. This is after [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1655.8s)]
*  Elon Musk had seen that we're playing for keeps here and he still went all in with Donald Trump. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1664.52s)]
*  I would suggest that that type of contribution to somebody's campaign. Now listen, don't get me [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1673.0800000000002s)]
*  wrong. I'm not suggesting that therefore Elon should get to be president or that therefore [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1682.52s)]
*  Elon gets his agenda through. No, the American people did not vote for Elon Musk. The American [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1687.96s)]
*  people voted for Donald Trump. Now probably I think it's reasonable to say Donald Trump wouldn't have [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1693.16s)]
*  won without Elon Musk's support or certainly his support helped a lot. But I'm not suggesting that [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1697.8s)]
*  therefore Elon is entitled to anything other than he's entitled to say he doesn't like a bill and [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1703.08s)]
*  you should call your congressmen and senators to not support it. He has a right to do that. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1710.36s)]
*  And I think after doing that much for somebody, it is not reasonable to feel like that crossed [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1715.0s)]
*  some line that they're not allowed to cross. That's all I'm saying. Okay, so that being said, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1723.64s)]
*  so then in the escalations of all these things, so then at this point now, Elon Musk has backed [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1730.92s)]
*  Rand Paul, backed Thomas Massie, opposed the bill, and encouraged people to call their congressmen [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1737.72s)]
*  to put pressure on them not to vote for the thing. Now this is where Donald Trump really escalates [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1743.48s)]
*  the situation. And I gotta say, I think this was a very poor decision by Donald Trump. I think that [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1750.12s)]
*  there is, again, in this world, there are allies that are powerful enough that you should not burn [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1756.6s)]
*  that bridge over something that you may not agree with but was their right to do. It's not unreasonable. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1766.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm just never going to get to a place where you'd say that somebody who gave you, who [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1772.6s)]
*  bought a platform for you, I mean, he didn't buy the platform for you, but in effect, buying this [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1777.56s)]
*  platform opened it up for you to have a voice again and your biggest supporters to have a voice [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1782.44s)]
*  again, gave your campaign $300 million, has put his reputation behind you and risked his company, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1787.3999999999999s)]
*  his reputation, perhaps his life to support you. That guy should be shown the respect of like, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1795.32s)]
*  okay, we agree to disagree on this one. Let's go to the tape because this is what Donald Trump said [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1802.92s)]
*  and I really think this is where things headed south. Do we have that? Thanks, Natalie. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1809.16s)]
*  So we've done a great job. Elon knew that. Elon endorsed me very strongly. He actually went up [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1819.64s)]
*  and campaigned for me. I think I would have won, Susie would say I would have won Pennsylvania [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1825.96s)]
*  easily anyway, even if the governor ran, the real governor, not the governor from Minnesota, who's, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1830.6s)]
*  I mean, he's a sick puppy, that guy, that poor guy, I feel sorry for him, but they made a bad [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1836.1999999999998s)]
*  choice with him. But if you pick Shapiro or anybody else, I spoke to him recently about his, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1841.3999999999999s)]
*  you know, his house being set on fire, which was terrible. But if they picked him, I would have [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1847.3999999999999s)]
*  won Pennsylvania. I won it by a lot. But I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1853.72s)]
*  of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1860.6000000000001s)]
*  about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem and he only developed [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1865.88s)]
*  the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate because that's billions [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1869.88s)]
*  and billions of dollars. And it really is unfair. We want to have cars of all types, electric. We [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1873.96s)]
*  want to have electric, but we want to have gasoline, combustion. We want to have different, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1879.72s)]
*  we want to have hybrids. We want to have all, we want to be able to sell everything. And when [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1885.72s)]
*  that was cut and Congress wanted to cut it, he became a little bit different. And I can understand [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1891.08s)]
*  that. But he knew every aspect of this bill. He knew it better than almost anybody. And he never [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1897.08s)]
*  had a problem until right after he left. And if you saw the statements he made about me, which I'm [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1903.24s)]
*  sure you can get very easily, it's very fresh on tape. He said the most beautiful things about me [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1908.2s)]
*  and he hasn't said bad about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm, I'm very [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1914.04s)]
*  disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot. All right. So look, although Donald Trump might be [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1918.68s)]
*  saying this in a slightly diplomatic tone, I thought that was a major escalation. And what, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1928.28s)]
*  Donald Trump, first of all, you got to understand the guy who, like really, when you think about it, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1935.96s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to sit here. First of all, he's imputing the guy's integrity. He's blatantly [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1944.68s)]
*  saying, and this was as, as Donald Trump says in the tape there, the Elon Musk had not taken [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1951.88s)]
*  personal shots at Donald Trump yet, but Donald Trump, that is a personal shot. He's saying like [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1956.76s)]
*  straight up, like this guy's a liar. This guy has zero integrity. He's saying he doesn't really [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1963.24s)]
*  have a problem with the bill because of the reasons he's telling you he has a problem with the bill. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1968.84s)]
*  He has a problem because it's not in his interest. It's not that he didn't get whatever provision [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1973.08s)]
*  about electrical vehicles that he wanted in the bell. Now, again, we don't know whether that's [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1978.28s)]
*  true or not. We don't know what someone's pure intentions are. This is like what I was saying [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1986.68s)]
*  at the beginning of the show. You don't even know your own intentions half the time. So like, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1991.96s)]
*  I'm not saying there's no possibility that this is correct. However, for Donald Trump to make this [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=1996.52s)]
*  accusation, this is an attack, a very serious attack on someone's character. And again, you know, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2002.68s)]
*  I've had this just with me this week. I've had a bunch of people because, you know, before this [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2011.16s)]
*  happened, the big thing on Twitter was my debate on Piers Morgan the other day. And really not so [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2016.04s)]
*  much about me. It was more about Piers Morgan just being fed up with the Hasbro propaganda. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2022.2s)]
*  But people, I got a bunch of people asking me like, hey, Dave, is this new? Is Piers Morgan being [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2028.36s)]
*  genuine here? Has he really turned against the war? Or did he just see which way the wind was [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2034.52s)]
*  blowing? And he went this way. And like, people are asking me like, I have no idea. I don't know [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2039.56s)]
*  what's in Piers Morgan's heart and soul. Why? Because I do a show like, I don't know. I have no [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2044.76s)]
*  idea. But what how am I to move forward in the world? Am I going to suspect that everybody has [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2051.08s)]
*  some ulterior motivation? Or you have to to a certain degree kind of take people at their word. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2056.6s)]
*  I don't know. Who knows what someone's true intentions are? Anyway, the point here is that [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2061.4s)]
*  Donald Trump is now from his very large megaphone blasting that Elon Musk is someone you can't trust. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2067.08s)]
*  He claims to care about these issues, these principles, but he doesn't. He only really [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2076.28s)]
*  cares about his own bottom line. That's what Donald Trump was saying there. And then on top of that, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2080.52s)]
*  he's going to turn around and say he's done so much for Elon Musk. Now, just imagine, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2086.68s)]
*  imagine, imagine, just forget even like the other stuff. Imagine just someone you gave $300 million [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2094.2s)]
*  to is telling you, you know, I've done so much for you. I don't know. I'm not seeing, I'm not [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2100.9199999999996s)]
*  seeing that. I'm not seeing how that makes sense. Donald Trump. What have you really done for Elon [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2109.24s)]
*  Musk? Elon Musk was before he supported Donald Trump a year ago today. Elon Musk was the richest [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2119.08s)]
*  man in the world. He was doing pretty good already. What exactly has Donald Trump done for Elon Musk [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2126.12s)]
*  that's made his life so much better? It seems to me now, don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2134.6s)]
*  Donald Trump for a bunch of liberals keying up Teslas or something like that. This is a choice [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2140.12s)]
*  that Elon Musk made, but it seems to be one that came with sacrifice. Now, Donald Trump, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2145.64s)]
*  you could also certainly argue, could just be a rich, famous socialite having a nice time and [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2151.72s)]
*  instead decided to do this and is now dealing with a lot of, you know, a lot. But that wasn't Elon [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2157.0s)]
*  Musk. You know, it's like he didn't deal with that because he supported Elon Musk. He dealt with that [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2163.16s)]
*  because he ran for president. Elon Musk dealt with his things because he supported Donald Trump. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2168.2s)]
*  So I just don't think this was wise of Donald Trump to do. And again, like I said at the beginning, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2174.2s)]
*  when you're playing on this level, you got to kind of be careful about how you talk about people [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2184.28s)]
*  because then Elon Musk took this escalation from Donald Trump and then took it to DEF CON 10. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2188.52s)]
*  So Elon Musk, first of all, said that this was a lie, that Donald Trump had made the claim that he [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2197.08s)]
*  had seen the bill and he was on board with the bill and it was only after the EV thing didn't [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2205.88s)]
*  come through. Then he wasn't on board with it anymore. Elon Musk goes, that's a straight up lie. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2209.88s)]
*  I never was aware of the bill. I never supported the bill. Then Elon Musk tweeted, and this was the [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2214.12s)]
*  one that caught my eye here. Hold on one second. I will pull it up right here. Okay. So then he [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2222.6s)]
*  posted, without me, Trump would have lost the election. Dems would control that. By the way, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2231.96s)]
*  just to be clear, Elon Musk replied, tweeted this to that video that we just watched. So he [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2240.44s)]
*  responded directly to what we just watched and said, without me, Trump would have lost the election. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2246.84s)]
*  Dems would control the house and the Republicans would have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, such [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2252.76s)]
*  in gratitude. Again, kind of hard to argue with what Elon Musk is saying here, in my opinion. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2259.0800000000004s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Blackout [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2269.0800000000004s)]
*  Coffee. I love this stuff. I've been drinking their cold brew for the last month. It's absolutely [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2273.48s)]
*  delicious. I am a bit of a coffee snob, and I love this stuff. Roasted right here in the USA by people [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2278.68s)]
*  who believe in liberty, personal responsibility, and the Constitution. They do all the roasting, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2285.08s)]
*  packing, and shipping in-house. There's no middleman and no compromises. They have over 25,000 [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2290.92s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. But then he really took it to Defcon when he posted [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2323.8s)]
*  time to drop the really big bomb. Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2333.4799999999996s)]
*  they have not been made public. Have a nice day, Donald Trump. Mark this post for the future. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2341.56s)]
*  The truth will come out. All right, so obviously, Elon Musk decided to burn the bridge. I mean, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2347.7999999999997s)]
*  I think that's pretty much it. I don't think there's any coming back from that. Now, I would [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2356.2799999999997s)]
*  say that I thought this tweet made no sense and reflected poorly on Elon Musk in general. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2361.72s)]
*  First of all, we'll look, I'll say it like this. We already know what we know about Donald Trump [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2373.3199999999997s)]
*  and his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. We know what we know. We don't know beyond that. But [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2384.4399999999996s)]
*  there's no question that at the very least, they were friendly. There is a tape where Jeffrey [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2390.04s)]
*  Epstein refers to Donald Trump as his best friend. But we know that they partied together. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2399.48s)]
*  Donald Trump is on record in one of the creepiest remarks that anyone's ever made about Jeffrey [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2405.4s)]
*  Epstein, where he's talking about how Jeffrey Epstein likes the ladies as much as anyone. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2411.24s)]
*  And then he starts going off on a thing about how he likes them really young. Pretty creepy. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2417.08s)]
*  We know he's been on his plane. We know they were friends. They partied together, like all this stuff. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2423.88s)]
*  So for Elon Musk to come out and say Donald Trump is in the files wouldn't actually be [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2428.68s)]
*  new information. This wouldn't be anything we wouldn't expect. We'd expect Donald Trump's [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2436.84s)]
*  name to be mentioned in the files. The relevant question would be like, did Donald Trump commit [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2443.24s)]
*  any crimes? How involved was Donald Trump? And Elon Musk doesn't exactly say that. But he does say [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2448.2799999999997s)]
*  he's in the files and that's the reason why the files haven't come out. Which is, again, possibly [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2454.7599999999998s)]
*  true. We don't know. The problem is that to come out and say that now, because he took some [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2460.4399999999996s)]
*  shots at you, which by the way, again, I blame Donald Trump for that. Donald Trump was out of line [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2473.08s)]
*  and he's the one who burnt that bridge in my opinion. But it just doesn't reflect great on Elon [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2477.4s)]
*  Musk to be like, yes, I knew about this the whole time and was like, you know, as many people, I'm [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2484.84s)]
*  far from the only one who pointed this out on Twitter. But like, are you saying like, if you had [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2491.0s)]
*  gotten spending cuts, then that would have been okay? Like, so you knew Donald Trump was implicated [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2495.88s)]
*  in the Epstein thing, but you were not going to say anything about that? Because but it was then [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2501.88s)]
*  when he did that and had a reckless fiscal policy that was too far. There's just no way that this [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2506.52s)]
*  reflects good on Elon Musk. But regardless of any of that, here we are. I don't you know, I've seen [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2511.96s)]
*  some people online saying that maybe Donald Trump and Elon Musk can work this out or something like [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2520.6800000000003s)]
*  that. To me, these type of comments, they've I just don't think there's any coming back from that. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2526.92s)]
*  I just don't think so. And that, you know, is it is what it is. Okay, this is this is about as nasty [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2535.2400000000002s)]
*  and as not just it's not just being nasty. It's not just insulting each other. It is both of them now [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2549.3199999999997s)]
*  have in the most vicious, profound way attacked the essence of the other's character. You know, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2559.48s)]
*  like you've you've told your people that this guy is a fucking piece of shit liar. Both of them, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2568.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, Donald Trump has told his people now that Elon Musk is fucking lying to you. He doesn't [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2578.04s)]
*  give a shit about he doesn't give a shit about government spending. He doesn't care about any [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2584.28s)]
*  of the things he claims to. He was just trying to get rich from government contracts for electric [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2589.08s)]
*  vehicles. He's a fraud. That's Donald Trump's allegation. And Elon Musk's allegation is that [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2593.48s)]
*  Donald Trump is keeping secret a you know, the details of a giant pedophile ring, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2601.24s)]
*  like the most heinous crimes committed by the highest levels of American society [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2608.9199999999996s)]
*  for his own self interest, because he thinks it would look bad and maybe even criminally implicate [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2613.64s)]
*  Donald Trump. I mean, I don't know, he doesn't say it. But there's no way you could read that [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2619.56s)]
*  and not like take that as an implication. I don't know how you get from there back to a healthy [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2623.56s)]
*  working relationship, I would venture to say this, this is done. Maybe I could be wrong, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2629.24s)]
*  who knows crazier things, I guess have happened. But I think it's pretty reasonable to say, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2635.24s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be fixing this relationship. So this is kind of the, the drama [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2639.7999999999997s)]
*  and the personal aspect to all of this. I guess what I'm left with here is is saying, to reiterate, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2648.52s)]
*  again, I'm not claiming that you can know what any of their motivations are here. I think it's a [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2657.72s)]
*  reasonable assumption that ego is playing some role for both of these men. And, you know, and [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2664.12s)]
*  there's also it's also reasonable to assume that they both have their own self interest in all of [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2674.9199999999996s)]
*  this. But I will say that when it comes to the actual issue, like if we're if we're taking people [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2683.08s)]
*  at the word, and we're going to be charitable and give people the benefit of the doubt, there are [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2691.3199999999997s)]
*  two major issues that Elon Musk has has essentially attached his brand to, has said, look, this is what [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2697.0s)]
*  I stand for. This is what I'm this is what I oppose. This is what I'm fighting for. And these two issues [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2707.24s)]
*  were free speech. That this was the whole his stated reason for buying Twitter. So really, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2713.3999999999996s)]
*  Elon Musk has attached himself to free speech and out of control government spending. And on these [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2723.08s)]
*  two issues, Elon Musk has picked two of if not the two most important issues of our time, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2730.28s)]
*  and he is 100% on the right side of both of them. Now, if you want to sit here and argue with me [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2740.76s)]
*  that there is some conspiracy in the background that he is trying to collect data, he's partnering [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2747.4s)]
*  up with Palantir, he's trying to usher in this new oligarchy. I mean, look, I'm not I don't know. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2754.28s)]
*  Maybe you're right. Again, I can't you know, it's enough of a challenge to read your own [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2760.84s)]
*  heart and soul that it is a it is a near impossibility to for me to do that with someone [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2768.28s)]
*  like Elon Musk who I've never met. So I you know, that I'm not denying that that is possibly the [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2774.6000000000004s)]
*  case. I'm simply saying, if you listen to what Elon Musk is saying, he's telling you that these [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2782.04s)]
*  are his key two issues. They are maybe maybe the number one and number two most important issues [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2788.52s)]
*  of our time. They are certainly up there. Certainly both in the top five. And he is [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2795.88s)]
*  absolutely correct on the issue. Absolutely correct. I mean, what was released in the [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2801.8s)]
*  Twitter files should if we weren't living in such crazy times, they would it would be the number one [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2807.64s)]
*  scandal of our generation. It's it's not probably because there's been so many others, you know, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2813.4s)]
*  but that's not that doesn't take away from the importance of the issue. It just happens to be [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2819.56s)]
*  that the government shut the world down over a virus that they made and then lied about. But [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2823.8799999999997s)]
*  whatever. Then that happens to be that they've started, you know, seven mass murder campaigns [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2827.72s)]
*  based on lies in the last 25 years. And they framed the current president of the United States [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2832.12s)]
*  for treason. So like, OK, there were other things that happened that might take the cake. But oh, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2837.48s)]
*  my God, what a scandal it was that the government was suppressing free speech through social media [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2841.48s)]
*  companies, pressuring the social media companies to ban certain people, pressuring them to kill [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2848.2s)]
*  certain stories explicitly for political reasons. Then Elon Musk bought Twitter and cleaned up at [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2853.48s)]
*  least a lot of that. Now, I'm not saying he's cleaned up all of it. And I'm not saying that we [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2860.52s)]
*  have you are unbridled free speech on social media, but it is much, much better than it was. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2865.88s)]
*  Dissidents of the regime have a real fighting shot now to voice their opinion. And if there is one [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2874.76s)]
*  person who deserves the most credit for that, it is Elon Musk. That I know for sure. So that's him [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2882.36s)]
*  on the free speech front. And then he decided to take on this issue of government spending. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2888.84s)]
*  And go all in on it. And he, you know, again, this is like the richest guy in the world. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2895.3199999999997s)]
*  He's doing this for free. Now, OK, you could argue there's some other self-interest in it [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2903.8799999999997s)]
*  down the road, maybe. But at least on the surface of it, there seems to be a lot of other things [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2909.3999999999996s)]
*  this guy could do to make a lot of money and get a lot of power. And he's doing this instead. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2914.2799999999997s)]
*  And so whatever you want to speculate about his motivations, he is correct on an enormously [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2919.4s)]
*  important issue. An enormously important issue. Listen, again, if it wasn't for, say, all the [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2926.6800000000003s)]
*  scandals that I just mentioned and the ones that we cover on this show regularly, this is, you know, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2932.92s)]
*  it's like the greatest scandal in the history of America. But it's so slow moving and it's [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2940.44s)]
*  right in front of our eyes that no one even treats it like the scandal that it is. But [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2944.84s)]
*  the fucking our federal government has bankrupted the United States of America. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2950.04s)]
*  They inherited the USA and presided over a bankruptcy. It is so goddamn appalling. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2957.08s)]
*  And it is not, as some people try to make it, it's not like just a made up thing or just some like [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2965.08s)]
*  accounting numbers. I know there's like that's like what's been popular on like left TikTok or [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2972.7599999999998s)]
*  something like that for many years now. Before TikTok, it was other things, but it would always [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2977.96s)]
*  just be like, oh, it's just a number. We could just erase it and write a new number. Money's fake. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2983.48s)]
*  Who cares? Who cares about the national debt? But that is bullshit. That is not true. Look, as we've [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2988.68s)]
*  said before on the show many times, and this is something that Elon Musk is, he is well aware of [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=2995.08s)]
*  this argument because he constantly, I think he was just the other day sharing another Milton [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3002.52s)]
*  Friedman video where he was breaking this down. But the fact is that government spending [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3007.48s)]
*  has enormous consequences on a society and government spending. And this is the stuff [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3016.44s)]
*  that Milton Friedman was breaking down that Elon Musk has regularly shared. So when you, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3022.44s)]
*  government spending is the real tax, right? That's the tax is that government spends money. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3027.4s)]
*  Now, when government spends money, there are three different options that they have, but only three [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3034.2000000000003s)]
*  of how they're going to pay for that spending. Okay. The first obvious one is that they tax you. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3040.6800000000003s)]
*  The second one is that they borrow the money. And the third is that they print the money. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3046.76s)]
*  This is how government pays for what they spent. Now, let's just go through these one at a time [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3051.24s)]
*  real quick. Okay. When government taxes you, they by force, the threat of violence, take your money [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3057.7999999999997s)]
*  and then they spend it. Okay. Now, what this does is it essentially removes the money from where it [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3067.16s)]
*  would have been allocated and puts it into people who are connected to government. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3076.52s)]
*  This might be weapons companies. This might be some solar energy company. This might be some [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3081.72s)]
*  health insurance, whatever it might be. They take the money out of the productive economy [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3086.7599999999998s)]
*  and give it to their cronies. Now, so me personally, okay, and this is just one small [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3091.8s)]
*  example in a country of hundreds of millions of people, but I pay about half of what I make [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3097.24s)]
*  every year in taxes. I would make double if I wasn't forced to pay taxes. There is simply, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3104.2s)]
*  look, there's just no question about it that if you were to, if you were to abolish my taxes, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3113.3999999999996s)]
*  which would instantly double my income, what I would pay Rob more money, I would pay Natalie [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3122.3599999999997s)]
*  more money, and I would certainly hire at least one or two other people. There's just no question [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3128.68s)]
*  about that. What would happen if you were to just double my productivity? I would be able to pay [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3133.48s)]
*  more to the people who work for me and I would be able to hire more people who work for me. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3141.16s)]
*  So there is an enormous burden that taxation puts on the regular productive economy because this is [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3145.8s)]
*  not just, again, I'm just one example and I don't even really, I run a very small business. If you [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3152.92s)]
*  were to now do that for every single business owner in America, if they were to get huge tax [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3159.32s)]
*  relief, we'd be able to pay their people more and hire more people. It is a tremendous cost [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3166.84s)]
*  to the economy, the productive economy that we have to pay such high taxes. All right, guys, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3171.7200000000003s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Crowd Health, a great [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3177.0800000000004s)]
*  company that I've been telling you about for many years. We all know the health insurance system is [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3181.6400000000003s)]
*  broken. Nobody that I know really likes their health insurance provider and we talk at length [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3186.28s)]
*  on this show about why that is. It's all because of government intervention, but now there is a [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3193.1600000000003s)]
*  true alternative to health insurance and that is Crowd Health. Crowd Health is a decentralized [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3197.6400000000003s)]
*  health care payment system that frees you from the tyranny of health insurance. You can go to [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3204.0400000000004s)]
*  whatever doctor you'd like because there are no networks. It's significantly less expensive than [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3208.92s)]
*  health insurance. Singles are just $185 a month. A family of four is $605 a month and you can use [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3213.8s)]
*  the promo code POTP to get $99 a month per person for the next three months. Go check them out. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3221.2400000000002s)]
*  Crowd Health is not health insurance. It's a totally different way of paying for health care. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3229.2400000000002s)]
*  Terms and conditions may apply. Check them out at joincrowdhealth.com. That's joincrowdhealth.com [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3234.04s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. That's taxing. Number two is borrowing. It's borrowing [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3248.2000000000003s)]
*  the money and this is where a bill like this that adds to the debt. This is where the borrowing has [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3253.88s)]
*  gotten so crazy that we're now just into goofy numbers, tens of trillions of dollars that we owe [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3259.32s)]
*  and this is a commitment that future taxpayers will have to pay back. So this is a commitment [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3267.0s)]
*  that we will continue to starve the real productive economy in the future to pay off for the nonsense [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3272.28s)]
*  consumption that our government borrowed to spend. And then of course if you think the debt's bad, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3278.68s)]
*  we'll understand or if you think you're paying too much in taxes or if the national debt sure [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3285.24s)]
*  does look like a scary number, just keep in mind that that's not nearly enough. Government spending [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3290.76s)]
*  is so out of control that they simply cannot tax us enough or borrow enough in order to keep spending [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3297.88s)]
*  at these levels because there is the thing about taxation is it is a bit of a balance. You can only [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3305.7200000000003s)]
*  tax so much before people just stop working as much or just close down businesses they otherwise [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3312.6000000000004s)]
*  would have started. I mean if you want to just reducto absurdum this, if you were to say that [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3319.0s)]
*  you were going to tax me 100% so if you were to tax me every single dollar I make I owe to the [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3324.76s)]
*  government, I keep none of it for myself. 100% tax rates on all income levels. Well then obviously [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3333.0800000000004s)]
*  anyone here can see there is now zero incentive to work. There's no reason to work because you [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3339.48s)]
*  don't get any of it. Why the hell would I work if I didn't get any of the money? Okay I kind of like [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3346.2s)]
*  what I do but like for most people there's no zero. Okay well that's the reducto absurdum [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3351.7999999999997s)]
*  but still at 99%, 98%, 97% it's still pretty almost no incentive to work. So you can't just tax to [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3357.16s)]
*  infinity. Eventually people will just stop producing because there's no incentive to. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3366.68s)]
*  So they can only tax so much. There are limits on borrowing because eventually people don't want to [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3371.16s)]
*  lend you money. Whether it's individuals or foreign countries they have to choose to lend you the money [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3377.48s)]
*  and you can only find so many people who will lend you money. So there's limits on that. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3383.3999999999996s)]
*  Money printing on the other hand, you're not even limited at this point by the trees you can cut [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3390.2s)]
*  down because you know most of the money printing at this point is not even actually printed. It's [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3395.3199999999997s)]
*  just zeros on a computer. The Federal Reserve just sends them over to JP Morgan Chase. It's [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3399.88s)]
*  nothing as many zeros as you can type. That's what you're limited to. And so that is the preferred [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3405.08s)]
*  or one of the preferred methods of how governments maintain this level of spending. And this is what [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3413.0s)]
*  has wrecked our society. Not just wrecked our economy, wrecked our society. This is the reason [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3419.08s)]
*  why prices are out of control. It's the reason why young people can't afford to own a home and to [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3424.76s)]
*  send kids to college and to you know whatever all of the things that you'd need to do. If you think [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3431.0s)]
*  about it there is absolutely no reason why we should have this affordability crisis. Now this [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3435.6400000000003s)]
*  is something that I think is lost on a lot of people because if you don't spend time thinking [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3442.28s)]
*  about this it's very easy to just take it for granted. And especially since we've lived in an [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3448.84s)]
*  inflationary economy for you know 112 years or whatever it's been since 1913 when the Federal [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3455.8s)]
*  Reserve was created. And it becomes this thing where almost everybody just like regular people [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3463.88s)]
*  who aren't even paying attention to politics at all you just as I once did too you just take it [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3473.0s)]
*  for granted. It's almost like a given that prices rise over time. That's what they do right? Prices [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3478.76s)]
*  go up. I mean you know your grandma will have some story about how a bottle of coke used to cost a [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3485.5600000000004s)]
*  nickel and you're like yeah that same bottle of coke cost two dollars and fifty cents now but like [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3490.84s)]
*  that's what prices do. They go up. They go from being a nickel to being two dollars and fifty cents [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3495.48s)]
*  but that's not organic. That is not there's no law of nature that says that prices just go up. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3500.6000000000004s)]
*  That things just get more expensive. That's not like written into stone anywhere and in fact the [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3507.32s)]
*  natural order of a productive economy is for prices to fall. Now people don't know this but in 1913 [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3513.8s)]
*  if you were talking to your grandma she would have been telling you how expensive something was to buy [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3523.7200000000003s)]
*  back in her day and how much cheaper it is to buy today because we didn't live in an inflationary [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3530.04s)]
*  economy. We lived in a productive economy and when you live in a productive economy prices tend [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3535.16s)]
*  to fall. It's the natural path because you get better at producing things and therefore you can [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3539.8799999999997s)]
*  produce them more efficiently and therefore you don't have to charge as much for them. Like obviously [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3546.8399999999997s)]
*  if you just think about this on a basic level right like if you have technological improvements [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3551.7999999999997s)]
*  if the job were say like to make a man-made lake and I had to do it with men with shovels [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3558.44s)]
*  I'm going to have to charge you a lot more than if I were to do it with an excavator. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3568.36s)]
*  If I have the machinery and the technology one man can now do the work of like a hundred men. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3573.08s)]
*  It's just much cheaper to produce things. You can charge less for them but we don't live in that [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3578.68s)]
*  world because we live in this world of insane government spending and they can't tax us enough [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3583.0s)]
*  and they can't borrow enough so they have to print up the money and when they print up the money who [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3588.52s)]
*  ends up getting the money first because that's what the whole game is about when you when you [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3593.16s)]
*  print new money right theoretically theoretically if you were to print money and evenly distribute [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3597.32s)]
*  it along the lines of how people already have money so like if you were to double the money supply [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3604.2s)]
*  but just give it out you know double everybody's individual net worth then you're not going to have [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3610.28s)]
*  a huge transfer of wealth it should be more or less around the same but that's not how it works [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3615.6400000000003s)]
*  who gets the money first when you print all this new money who gets it first well it's [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3622.76s)]
*  governments cronies and wall street but I repeat myself and this is where someone like Bernie [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3628.1200000000003s)]
*  Sanders can come in with whatever his numbers exactly are whether they're exactly accurate or [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3635.72s)]
*  not but where he says of the new wealth that's created 99 of it went to the top 1 of millionaires [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3640.04s)]
*  and billionaires well he's not completely wrong about that he doesn't know he doesn't understand [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3646.7599999999998s)]
*  who the real culprit is here he always just thinks it's greed and corporations but that's not actually [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3652.3599999999997s)]
*  true it's a government banking apparatus that is specifically designed to print money and give the [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3658.2s)]
*  new money to their friends first because of course when new money is printed the prices don't [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3665.64s)]
*  immediately rise it takes time for the money to get into the economy that drives upward pressure [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3671.7999999999997s)]
*  on prices and so if you get the new money immediately you buy stuff at the price that it used to be [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3676.8399999999997s)]
*  and then you sell it at the new artificially increased price and so essentially the bottom [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3682.52s)]
*  line here is that when it comes down to it Elon Musk has staked his reputation on two issues that [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3690.92s)]
*  he is absolutely correct on and are enormously important issues and I gotta say of all the [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3699.48s)]
*  reasons to walk away from the Donald Trump administration of all the reasons to like say no [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3708.36s)]
*  this is too much for me I won't cross this line this is a pretty damn good one it's a pretty damn [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3714.04s)]
*  good one this isn't just like some abstraction this level of government spending is destroying [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3720.12s)]
*  our society it is making our economy more and more corrupt and you just you can't overstate [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3726.68s)]
*  how how severe the costs of that are you know like it's beyond just economic costs it's like [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3735.0s)]

*  but i gotta say here um i think if i'm if i'm treating everybody charitably in the situation [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3900.12s)]
*  i understand why elon musk did what he did and i think donald trump was out of line [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3910.2s)]
*  to fucking throw him under the bus for it and at this point i don't think there's any repairing [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3914.8399999999997s)]
*  the relationship but elon musk where he goes from here is going to be very interesting i mean he was [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3920.2s)]
*  tweeting um about starting a third party the other day uh he's you know this is a guy who's got [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3926.36s)]
*  near infinite resources and might be interested in primaring some republicans in the midterms [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3933.32s)]

*  though obviously there were a lot of possibilities with the partnership of trump and elon i still [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3944.52s)]
*  think elon musk can be like a real force for good in uh in our in our society we will see and of [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3949.4s)]
*  course we will continue to follow uh whatever the the latest developments in this are we have not [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkK9RPAcs4&t=3957.8s)]
