# Dave Smith | Regime Change | Part Of The Problem 1279
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE)
*  What's up everybody? What's up? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=0.0s)]
*  and a lot has happened since the last time we spoke. Robbie the Fireburnstein joins me [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=12.44s)]
*  as always. How are you, sir? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=17.48s)]
*  I'm doing well. You know, I'm celebrating the little bit of freedom we have left out [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=19.48s)]
*  there on the porches. I'm holding hands with everybody in prayer and just trying to connect [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=22.98s)]
*  with nature and bring good vibes into the world. I'm becoming a real hippie, taking [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=27.98s)]
*  my shoes off, peeing into the wind, just doing whatever you can. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=32.6s)]
*  I hope the wind is at your back, my friend. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=36.78s)]
*  No, the wind's got to come back at you in order for the ceremony to work. Everybody [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=39.74s)]
*  knows this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=43.46s)]
*  Okay. All right. Well, it's a new world and maybe we got to try some new things. I can't [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=44.46s)]
*  argue with you. Now, I am as we record this, I've got my phone here and I'm getting updates [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  and texts from people and stuff. But there's so as of right now, as we're recording this, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=55.92s)]
*  it's 104 p.m. Eastern on Monday. It's evidently going down right now. Iran's retaliation, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=63.84s)]
*  Iran's response. Excuse me. They have sent missiles toward American bases, both in Qatar [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=73.64s)]
*  and Iraq. That's what's being reported so far. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  I thought we neutered them and they learned their lesson. That can't be possible. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=85.16s)]
*  Yes, that's right. Look, we're going to get into this in a second, but it has been there's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=88.16s)]
*  something about the war propaganda for this one. And it's I think particularly because [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  there is a very interesting dynamic where they're kind of attempting to launch a war. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=99.96s)]
*  And this isn't very different than say like Ukraine, where we were just backing the Ukrainian [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  forces and also Ukraine was invaded despite all of the provocations that led up to that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=110.28s)]
*  It's still a country that was invaded and you're selling the people on. We are going [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  to give them weapons to defend themselves. This is a much different situation. This is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=119.36s)]
*  America directly involved in a war. Although as of our last podcast, Rob, everyone was [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=123.24s)]
*  mocking us saying we're not in war, but I shouldn't say everyone, but a few dishonest [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=127.64s)]
*  people were. But this is now you're launching a war in the new media environment where the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=134.72s)]
*  corporate media is a corpse and the new media is what's vibrant and alive and where everybody [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  is getting their information from. And this creates a whole different dynamic and a whole [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=147.64s)]
*  different set of obstacles for the war party to get their propaganda through. But I've [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=152.44s)]
*  never I mean, I've seen so many wars that were sold off lies. All the wars in my lifetime [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=158.64s)]
*  have just had blatant lies at the very beginning of them. Like insane war propaganda. I've [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  never seen one where it's moving so quickly. It's like the talking points from three days [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  ago have completely been abandoned and people are pretending like they didn't even make [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=174.32s)]
*  those talking points three days ago. We'll get through all of this. Hold that thought [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=177.24s)]
*  in your head because that is there's a lot that we could expand on with that. But as [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=181.44s)]
*  of right now, the Iranian response seems to be going down. We will see what ends up coming [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=185.44s)]
*  of this. Of course, this is the real risk of escalation here. You know, if you if you [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=192.16s)]
*  could just do whatever you wanted to this country and nothing would ever respond, then [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=197.24s)]
*  maybe you could argue, we'll ding them a few times, then walk away. No problem. That gets [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=201.44s)]
*  very complicated by the fact that they can now do this and send missiles back at our [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=205.64s)]
*  basis. And of course, this is what you know, people like Scott Horton have been talking [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=210.16s)]
*  about for 20 years about the dangers of a war with with Iran. And me and you have been [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=214.28s)]
*  talking about this for quite a while ourselves. What happens now if 15 or 20 or 100 or, you [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=219.56s)]
*  know, God forbid, any like US servicemen are killed over this? You think you think Donald [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=226.4s)]
*  Trump's just going to take dead Americans and then he's not going to have to respond [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=232.8s)]
*  with something even greater? Anyway, we will I will bring you updates as they come during [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=236.76s)]
*  the course of this show. It's one of those things that this happens in our field of work [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=244.04s)]
*  where breaking a breaking thing is going down right as you're recording. It's a little annoying [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=249.88s)]
*  of the world if they could do their big things either before or after the show, that would [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=254.48s)]
*  be much more helpful going forward. But nonetheless, you know, if we had done an episode yesterday, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=258.2s)]
*  I might be like, hey, let's push back a couple hours and like see what happens here. And [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  then we'll talk about it. But I just felt like since you know, the the attack went down on [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=268.84s)]
*  the weekend when we don't record, we kind of had to do a podcast anyway, just catching [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=273.84s)]
*  up on everything that happened from from the beginning to here. So let's kind of go over [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=278.4s)]
*  this. As I was saying, it is really one of the things that's really remarkable about [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=283.0s)]
*  this, particularly in the position that I just happened to be in. So I've kind of like, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=288.12s)]
*  you know, I I happen to have I wouldn't say come on the radar, but I guess gotten to the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  point where like I'm like a prime focus of a lot of the kind of neocon war hacks, warhawk [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=301.64s)]
*  hacks. Yeah, Freudian slip, I suppose. But so, you know, like I just they just wrote [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  a hit piece in National Review about me the other day. I was quite proud of that that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  will be hung up here in the studio at some point. I have to get a physical copy of it, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=319.2s)]
*  which is, you know, next to impossible. No one reads the thing anymore. But still, it's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=324.52s)]
*  like, it's not as cool as if they had done it like when National Review really meant [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=329.56s)]
*  something. But it's the or the publication that drove Murray Rothbard out of the conservative [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=332.6s)]
*  movement is attacking me publicly. It's quite a badge of honor. I appreciate that. But, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=337.96s)]
*  you know, like Ben Shapiro and Mark Levin and all these guys have been coming. So so [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=342.88s)]
*  when it comes to this specific war, way, way, way back three days ago, these people were [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=346.12s)]
*  all mocking me because I said the US was involved in war. And I don't know if you could [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=353.56s)]
*  even remember back to 72 hours ago, Rob. But the talking point then, as they mocked [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=358.54s)]
*  me for being an ignorant comedian who doesn't really understand geopolitics, what they were [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=363.70000000000005s)]
*  running with three days ago was America isn't at war. You're just letting Israel take care [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=368.70000000000005s)]
*  of business. What's your problem, Dave? You criticize us when we fight other people's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=376.22s)]
*  wars. But now you're also criticizing us when we just let Israel conduct its own war. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=381.22s)]
*  And by the way, they've completely taken out the Iranian nuclear program. You remember [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=386.26s)]
*  that, Rob? This was their talking point after Israel's strike that Israel is so bad ass, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=390.74s)]
*  they have decapitated the nuclear weapons that Iran does not have. And that and of course, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  right after that, Donald Trump attacks. Now, when Donald Trump attacks, they say, that's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=405.26s)]
*  was the really successful one. Israel did just about everything. But Donald Trump, you [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=411.54s)]
*  know, we got these bunker busters and the might of the American military, we just needed [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=417.14000000000004s)]
*  to drop a couple bunker busters. That's all that happens. The rest of Israel handle all [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=420.58000000000004s)]
*  of this. Donald Trump then sends all of his people out to do the Sunday shows. He's got [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=424.70000000000005s)]
*  all these guys going out. They're all saying this is a one and done strike. There's no [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=435.5s)]
*  regime change here. This is not about a regime change. This was never a regime change war. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=439.68s)]
*  Then all day that day, I got everybody all the hawks on Twitter go and see Dave, you're [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=444.68s)]
*  arguing as if this is a regime change war. Then Donald Trump announces he wants regime [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=449.56s)]
*  change. That's the next step. Now they're all arguing why regime change is good. The [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=455.76s)]
*  same thing that they told you yesterday, you were stupid for believing. They'll now tell [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=461.08s)]
*  you not only is it true, but it's a great thing that it's happening. By the way, after [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=465.96s)]
*  the US strike, Israel then picked up their strikes and they're bombing non nuclear targets, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=470.44s)]
*  just regime targets, prisons filled with political enemies of the Iranian regime, different, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=476.91999999999996s)]
*  you know, like strategic, you know, targets of strategic value for the regime that have [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  absolutely nothing to do with nuclear sites. So again, it's just like with all these things, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=487.44s)]
*  it is, it's unbelievable the levels of dishonesty that the war hawks are capable of. Like it's, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=495.4s)]
*  it's something that's still to this day. It's like when you just talk to a complete liar, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=503.2s)]
*  there's something jarring about it, but they will argue with you, get you dragged into [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=507.79999999999995s)]
*  arguing this point. And then when you are proven right the next day, they just abandoned [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=512.72s)]
*  it like it never happened and move on to the next talking point about why you're stupid [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=519.3s)]
*  for not supporting the war. It is just, I don't know, man, it's, it's unbelievable to witness. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=523.12s)]
*  Any thoughts, Rob? Well, yeah, the lying and then complete pivot is pretty remarkable. It seemed I [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=528.28s)]
*  watched all of the wonderful content that you've done over the last couple of days. I watched the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=535.24s)]
*  zero hedge debate along with the Piers Morgan appearance. I feel like there was one other one, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=539.04s)]
*  but I watched all of it and it felt to me that some of what you were saying is this feels like [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=543.44s)]
*  the U S is a gambler and they've lost a lot of money gambling and they're walking into the casino [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=550.04s)]
*  going, Hey, I just want to look at the craps table. I'm not going to play at the craps table. And [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=554.64s)]
*  you're like, well, why don't we just not go near the craps table? It seems to always be a problem. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=559.0s)]
*  And they're going, it's not going to be a problem this time. This time we're just going to look at [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=563.28s)]
*  the thing. That's really, that's a great analogy. I'm like, Hey, you just bought chips. Why'd you [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=567.0s)]
*  buy chips? Why are you buying chips? No, I just like the way I like the way chips feel in my hand. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=570.64s)]
*  I'm not going to place it back. I'm just going to go get real close to the table. And you're like, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=575.8s)]
*  guys, I've seen this movie a lot before. I don't know. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=578.96s)]
*  And so now we're just a few days in and everything that they said of that we wouldn't be involved is [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=581.96s)]
*  not true. Uh, we might get to the clips later, but they've been playing, uh, you know, both JD Vance [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=587.12s)]
*  and, uh, Marco Rubio have been on the news going, this is not going to escalate into a fight. Um, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=592.2800000000001s)]
*  seemingly it already has, uh, one of the most remarkable claims is, Hey, they're just 14 days [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=597.6s)]
*  away from getting a bomb. And so we just need to do this one strategic strike. And then they won't [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=603.32s)]
*  be able to then claiming that it's done to find out a day later that I don't know that all the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=607.32s)]
*  sites were completely destroyed and potentially materials were taken out of one of the sites. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=612.6s)]
*  And also if they were just 14 days away, how do you know that they didn't contain any material [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=617.6400000000001s)]
*  in other locations that they could then break still continue to break out? Um, so yeah, it's [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=622.6s)]
*  been nothing but lies. It seems like the Donald Trump administration is absolutely looking to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=628.2s)]
*  actually have this war while continuously pretending. No, we're not even fighting them. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=633.08s)]
*  We're just going for the nuclear assets, the nuclear assets only. And all they need to do is [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=637.1600000000001s)]
*  come to the table and negotiate with us when why would they trust Donald Trump? Donald Trump lied [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  to them the first time he pulls a little bit of a doll hair move where he goes, well, I gave them [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=647.0s)]
*  the 60 days or I said, well, I was going to wait 14 days and make it. I was going to make a decision [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=651.48s)]
*  within 14 days. I made it the next day. I didn't lie to them, but I'm just saying after the Gaddafi [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=655.88s)]
*  situation and after the way that we've negotiated, why would they just trust us that if they were to [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=661.0s)]
*  absolutely fold on their nuclear ambitions and all of a sudden we're going to give them a big hug [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=665.96s)]
*  and just let them back into the world economy? Yeah, no, that's right. I mean, look, it's like, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=670.12s)]
*  um, at this point, you know, someone was arguing with me the other day and they said, um, you know, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=675.48s)]
*  something of like how, look, dude, it just like it can't, we cannot take the threat of a regime [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=681.96s)]
*  enriching to 60% uranium or something about that. And it's like, yeah, but just think about like [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=687.72s)]
*  the fucking incentive structure that you've created here. Like if this regime does survive, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=692.84s)]
*  which is quite possible. Um, and if this regime does survive, you're like, okay, so you're telling [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=697.88s)]
*  me that you, okay, for all the regime changes that America has had in, you ever see like where they [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=703.64s)]
*  list all the regime changes the U S has had like post world war two, but it's like all the regime [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=711.88s)]
*  changes through direct war or the CIA covert actions or colored revolutions or whatever. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=717.24s)]
*  It's just like a long list. I think we're at like 70 something nations that we've overthrown. None [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=722.44s)]
*  of them have had nukes. We do not overthrow nuclear armed regimes because it's just even for these [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=727.4s)]
*  guys, it's just too risky. So you're telling me we will, if you completely abandoned your nuclear [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=732.52s)]
*  ambitions, like Gaddafi will overthrow you. If you develop nukes, we won't overthrow you. If you hang [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=737.96s)]
*  around at 60%, that's high enough. We'll overthrow you. So like, it's like all every, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=744.52s)]
*  the incentive is just so obvious. You're creating the incentive for more people to, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=751.4s)]
*  to, you know, try to obtain nuclear weapons. Um, and worse, worse than that. And this feels a lot [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=755.4s)]
*  like a lot of what I'm seeing feels like the propaganda I've seen before. So if you remember [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=761.72s)]
*  the Ukraine propaganda, it was Biden refused to say that NATO will not, uh, Ukraine won't be a [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=766.12s)]
*  part of NATO, but then also pretended like we're not escalating the situation here. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=771.4s)]
*  And so on the same note, they keep floating this, this talking point of, well, they enriched all the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=775.8s)]
*  way to 60%. And, but then also the 60% is not really the problem from what I understand. They [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=780.28s)]
*  were willing to go back to just being allowed to enrich uranium. But then the Donald Trump, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=785.64s)]
*  they said, you guys can't enrich uranium at all. While then pretending that the issue was over the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=790.12s)]
*  60% enrichment. And it's like, that wasn't the fighting point. If anything, they went to the 60% [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=794.92s)]
*  to be within breakout range of having some sort of a nuclear deterrent, which speaking to your [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=799.64s)]
*  point, this new environment would suggest, don't be within range. Make sure that you're either fully [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=804.36s)]
*  there or not doing it at all because being within range, you're going to be treated as if you have [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=809.16s)]
*  it without actually having the deterrent. Yeah, that's, that's right. And, and just to be clear, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=813.4s)]
*  I mean, I know I've said this on, on some, uh, some other podcasts, but so like they were also, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=818.1999999999999s)]
*  it should be pointed out that Iran was in compliance with the JCPOA because the way the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=824.04s)]
*  deal was worked, right? Like the deal still exists. The deal was between like Europe, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=829.64s)]
*  America and Iran. But the way the deal was written was that if America pulls out of the deal, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=835.16s)]
*  then they're allowed to enrich up to 60%. So that's what they did. America pulled out and they went, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=841.4s)]
*  okay, well then we're going to exercise our option to enrich up, but there's, they still have the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=846.28s)]
*  inspections regime. They still have inspectors coming in. That's how we know that they're at [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=850.36s)]
*  where they're at. That's actually what the Hawks are using against them is the reports coming back [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=854.44s)]
*  from the inspection regime that still is operating in Iran. And so, and also they're, they are on [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=860.6800000000001s)]
*  record saying, we will get back into the original JCPOA if America wants to come back into it. So [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=868.6800000000001s)]
*  they're sitting there and negotiate. Essentially they've admitted that we enriched all the way up [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=875.32s)]
*  to have something to negotiate away. That's, that's what they were trying. That was the Iranian [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=880.12s)]
*  perspective in these negotiations. And this has been widely reported. It's like they were, they [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=885.4s)]
*  were going like, Hey, look, we'll come back down our enrichment levels and you drop some of the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=889.4s)]
*  sanctions against us. Like they were trying to negotiate back into the deal that we already had [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=894.76s)]
*  before Donald Trump decided to walk away from it. It's just all, you know, any, so this idea that, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=900.68s)]
*  Oh, because they're enriched and, and look, all of this other stuff where even Tulsi Gabbard [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=906.76s)]
*  selling her soul and coming out and going, they could be weeks away, directly contradicting her [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=911.24s)]
*  testimony from just a couple months ago. And her, and, and even the intelligence she was putting out [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=916.04s)]
*  just a couple of weeks before that. Now they're saying they could be days away or weeks away. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=922.2s)]
*  This is a completely new talking point just invented after this war broke out. It wasn't, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=927.24s)]
*  it was not a talking point five minutes before Israel bombed Iran. Even Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=933.08s)]
*  after he launched the initial attack in his interview with Brett Baier said maybe a year, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=939.24s)]
*  maybe 13 months, but of course, Rob, and this is some of the stuff Thomas Massey is getting at. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=944.2s)]
*  And we talk a little bit about that too. Of course, if you have a year, then what does that mean? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=949.48s)]
*  There's plenty of time to debate the issue in Congress. This isn't a situation where there's [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=957.72s)]
*  some pending emergency and the president has to strike. It's like, no, he could bring this to [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=962.44s)]
*  Congress, bring all of the evidence. This is the way that our constitutional system supposedly was [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=967.96s)]
*  set up to work is that the people's representatives in the Congress would get to make a decision on [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=973.1600000000001s)]
*  behalf of the people looking at the evidence. Do we think that this threat, you know, whatever, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=978.5200000000001s)]
*  but of course none of them want to do that. So they just launched an illegal war of aggression. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=983.08s)]
*  Why not? You know, that's good enough. The Israelis say so. That's good enough. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=988.84s)]
*  Good enough for Trump, evidently. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=992.92s)]
*  for today's show, which is Crowd Health, a longtime sponsor of this show. It's a company [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=997.64s)]
*  we've been telling you guys about for many years now because they really are great and offer a [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1002.44s)]
*  tremendous service. They are an alternative to health insurance. So if you are somebody like me, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1006.04s)]
*  and I'd imagine most of you who don't really love your health insurance provider, maybe think the [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1012.36s)]
*  whole health insurance system is a big scheme that's rigged against you in favor of the big [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1017.64s)]
*  insurance providers, go check out Crowd Health, a true alternative to health insurance. Crowd Health [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1022.68s)]
*  is a decentralized health care payment system that frees you from the tyranny of health insurance. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1028.76s)]
*  You can go to whatever doctor you like because there's no networks and it's significantly less [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1034.36s)]
*  expensive than health insurance. Singles are $185 a month. A family of four is $605 a month. But [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1038.84s)]
*  right now you can use the promo code POTP to get just $99 a month per person for the next three [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1046.04s)]
*  months. Crowd Health is not health insurance. It's a totally different way of paying for health care. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  Terms and conditions may apply. To learn more, go to joincrowdhealth.com. All right, let's get back [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1058.2s)]
*  into the show. I guess there's a few other things that should be pointed out here. I was also, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1064.44s)]
*  I was criticized by a couple of people because I said something about how, you know, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1071.64s)]
*  that essentially here, and look, I understand people were saying basically that they were [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1081.0800000000002s)]
*  criticizing me of creating a framework where I'm right no matter what happens. And I kind of get [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1086.8400000000001s)]
*  that, you know, I understand someone saying like, hey, you're saying you're going to be right if this [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1092.76s)]
*  happens or right if it doesn't happen. But my point was just that like, look, there's only so [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1098.52s)]
*  many possibilities here. We will see how this all ends. But essentially what I was saying was like, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1103.48s)]
*  what I'm praying for now, this is after Trump's strike, you go, like the best case scenario here [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1109.24s)]
*  is that Iran really does just take this like a bitch. Like that they really do just take this [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1116.8400000000001s)]
*  kind of wave the white flag, you know, like that I knew they had to like respond in some way, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1123.16s)]
*  but maybe they do one of these like, you know, pretend responses like they did with Israel, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1128.52s)]
*  after Israel killed their their guy in Syria there, and they gave the US warning and then sent a [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1133.72s)]
*  bunch of missiles that were all shot down and didn't really kill anyone. And they've already [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1139.0800000000002s)]
*  done a little bit more than that in Israel this time, and they've killed some people. But like, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1143.0800000000002s)]
*  maybe the response would be something like that again, something like the post Soleimani response [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1147.0800000000002s)]
*  where they send some missiles at American bases, but don't actually kill anybody or something like [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1151.8s)]
*  that. But so like, what we're hoping for now, we're in a we're in a position where we are [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1156.44s)]
*  relying on Iranian restraint. This is the position that the hawks have brought us to, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1162.12s)]
*  where we're counting on the mullahs to not do something crazy. And I was just making the point [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1168.2s)]
*  that look, the best case scenario here is that that nothing like they do that they they post out, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1174.52s)]
*  they don't have a real response to this. And then somehow Donald Trump is able to say, look, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1181.08s)]
*  I'm so great, we hit them, we walk away, it doesn't lead to a wider war. But I was just making the [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1185.8s)]
*  point that if that happens, and then you know, people can, people will undoubtedly, you know, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1190.84s)]
*  say, oh, you guys were alarmists on this, or you got it all wrong, you were talking about what a [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1197.56s)]
*  catastrophe this has been, but look, it didn't turn out to be that bad of a thing. But I was saying, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1201.96s)]
*  if that is the case, then really, even though your people are going to say, oh, you were alarmist, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1206.68s)]
*  the real takeaway from that would be that it disproves the entire foundation of the hawks [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1212.68s)]
*  argument here. Right? Like, if the whole argument is that, yes, obviously, we are, I mean, at least [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1218.52s)]
*  the ones who aren't lying through their teeth, we go, yes, Israel has secret nukes, secret nukes [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1225.0800000000002s)]
*  aren't really the big problem. The big problem is the moas can't get nuclear weapons. Sure, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1229.72s)]
*  Kim Jong Un has nuclear weapons. Sure, Joseph Stalin had nuclear weapons, Massey Tong had nuclear [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1235.32s)]
*  weapons, you know, like some of the worst people who have ever existed in the history of the world. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1240.6799999999998s)]
*  In fact, say the worst people who have ever existed in the history of the world had nuclear [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1243.96s)]
*  weapons. Okay, but no, no, no, no, no, I know India has nuclear, Pakistan has nuclear weapons, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1248.6s)]
*  no, no, no, no. But if Iran gets nuclear weapons, that is cannot be allowed to happen. You know, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1253.32s)]
*  like nobody ever suggested that we just launch a war of aggression against Joseph Stalin's Soviet [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1258.44s)]
*  Union because he was pursuing nuclear weapons, even though it was Joseph Stalin. You know what [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1267.4s)]
*  I mean? Like even though it's like a guy who's already committed genocides, it's still Mao Zedong [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1272.68s)]
*  killed more people than any human being who's ever lived. And yet nobody suggested the response to [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1278.76s)]
*  him having a nuclear research program was to launch an aggressive war against China. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1285.08s)]
*  Nobody suggested that we preemptively strike India or Pakistan. So, right, so my point is that the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1290.9199999999998s)]
*  whole case for the Hawks rests on this kind of unfalsifiable assertion that Iran with nukes [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1297.32s)]
*  will destroy the world. It's just, this is a risk we cannot tolerate. But if Iran takes this and [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1307.0s)]
*  doesn't do anything major in response, doesn't that just disprove the whole thing? Because the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1314.68s)]
*  only reason they wouldn't do that is because like all of those people, as bad as all of them are, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1319.48s)]
*  as bad as Mao and Stalin, and as bad as like all these people throughout history have been, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1325.88s)]
*  one of the things that they have in common that makes them kind of human is they like being in [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1331.96s)]
*  power and they like being alive and they don't want to die. They do have self-preservation. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1335.64s)]
*  And so Iran, obviously, not just now or today, even before these strikes, Iran could do a lot [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1341.3999999999999s)]
*  of damage to Israel or our bases in the region, but they don't want to do that because they know [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1346.6s)]
*  what will happen then. Okay, well, what happens if they nuke someone else? Everybody knows. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1350.6799999999998s)]
*  Nobody doesn't think that if Iran had a nuke and then used it offensively that the country [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1356.52s)]
*  wouldn't be destroyed as a result of it. The problem is just then you're at nuclear war, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1362.6s)]
*  but everyone knows they'd be blown off the map. They'd be obliterated as Hillary Clinton threatened [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1367.24s)]
*  to do. So if it is survival that dictates their restraint, then that just proves the whole point. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1373.08s)]
*  And then my other point was that if they do respond and they do end up like killing some Americans [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1385.88s)]
*  and then we have to respond to that and then the situation escalates, well, then we're at this [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1392.84s)]
*  tremendous risk of another disaster. And so people could say, oh, I'm creating a situation [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1397.8799999999999s)]
*  where I'm right no matter what, but like I'm just saying argue with the point there. We didn't have [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1403.6399999999999s)]
*  to do this. And now the best case scenario is Iran doesn't do anything major in response, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1408.36s)]
*  which disproves the Hawks entire position. Or what I got to say, I think is the more likely [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1413.72s)]
*  scenario here is that they do something in response. And now we got dead Americans or [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1418.76s)]
*  now we got a wider war all for something we didn't have to do to begin with. So yes, I guess I'm proven [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1424.44s)]
*  right in both scenarios, but I'm sorry, like make an argument about why either one of those is wrong. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1430.68s)]
*  It just seems so obvious. This is clearly, you know, you enter a war of choice and there's two [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1435.96s)]
*  options here, essentially, broadly speaking, and both of them disprove the Hawks own talking points. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1441.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, speaking to being right, no matter whatever ends up happening here, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1449.1599999999999s)]
*  I just see a lot of parallels between what we saw in COVID and the propaganda here, you know, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1454.52s)]
*  just 14 days to slow the curve, just I need 14 days to think about it. I don't actually want to [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1459.96s)]
*  be in a war. Yeah. And then the other one is, you know, my takeaway on the COVID thing the entire time [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1464.12s)]
*  was that the vaccine is just, I'm not going to tell you that the vaccine is going to, you know, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1471.08s)]
*  have a harmful effects to you because I don't know. But it seems like an unnecessary risk and that [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1475.56s)]
*  this thing is not good enough that we should be shutting down the country over. And I basically [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1480.6799999999998s)]
*  feel the same way about the Iran war. I don't have enough military intelligence to tell you, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1485.24s)]
*  hey, is Israel taking out every factory there? Is there so much discontent in the region that [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1489.3999999999999s)]
*  they're actually going to throw over the leader? Are we actually going to end up in a situation [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1493.96s)]
*  where this turns out to be better for Iran and we're just rid of this bad regime? I mean, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1497.24s)]
*  these are aggressive gambles and that's a possibility. I wouldn't predict that that's [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1501.72s)]
*  going to happen. I don't think it's likely going to happen. But at the end of the day, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1505.88s)]
*  I don't think that these risks justify that potential outcome because I don't think it's [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1508.92s)]
*  likely. And I don't even think it really serves our interest. At the end of the day, Iran does [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1513.8s)]
*  not have the capabilities of striking the United States of America. So this might serve Israel's [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1517.48s)]
*  interest. And no one ever explains to us why they're the most strategic asset. So it just, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1522.84s)]
*  the argument is essentially we are taking unnecessary risk that doesn't actually benefit [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1528.4399999999998s)]
*  our direct interest. There might be some corporate interest of that people don't want to, I rank oil [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1533.1599999999999s)]
*  on the market. That's not my direct interest. And so it's certainly in some people's special [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1538.12s)]
*  interest, but yes, it's not in the general interest of the American people to be an unnecessary risk. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1543.48s)]
*  And if you look at the track record of wars that we've had, and as you've said multiple times, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1548.6799999999998s)]
*  this is unlike any of the other wars that we've had because we have the debt that we have. We [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1552.52s)]
*  didn't have the debt that we currently have when we fought these other ones. And our country was [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1557.16s)]
*  slightly more unified when we had the, I'm just rehashing things I've heard from you on these [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1561.72s)]
*  other podcasts. But the point just being, I think it is a very fair and winnable argument to go, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1566.52s)]
*  these are unnecessary risks. And in the long shot that you managed to get this right, which you [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1572.12s)]
*  likely won't, but in the very long shot, I still don't think that this gamble is going to be worth [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1576.92s)]
*  the payoff and that the payoff is that great for us. Well, let me just real quick because [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1581.88s)]
*  I got an update here, which is actually a pretty big deal. So it's just reported right now, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1587.24s)]
*  Disclose TV, which is a good Twitter account to follow. Just in Iran coordinated, oh sorry, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1593.3200000000002s)]
*  this is from the New York Times. They're reposting it. Iran coordinated attacks on the US air base in [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1601.96s)]
*  Qatar with Qatari officials providing advanced notice to minimize casualties. So there is, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1608.04s)]
*  at least we've gotten some reporting here now that they did the thing again, where they give [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1616.04s)]
*  advanced notice to minimize casualties. This would check out because there were a bunch of, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1620.76s)]
*  like all over the region, everybody was on like the highest of alert and there were some evacuations [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1627.48s)]
*  and stuff happening earlier today. So hopefully maybe we are seeing the first scenario there where [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1632.52s)]
*  Iran is kind of bitching out and doing something for show. That being said, these things are still [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1640.6s)]
*  very dangerous because even that to minimize casualties, but what does that mean? What if [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1645.96s)]
*  there still are some casualties and then how's that going to be? And then you know, of course, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1650.36s)]
*  just like as you alluded to earlier, Rob, the whole thing is that so in the negotiations, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1655.56s)]
*  and this was widely reported, this was transparently the case that so Iran comes [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1661.24s)]
*  into the negotiations when Donald Trump saying he wants to negotiate. Donald Trump makes a 60-day [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1666.76s)]
*  time limit completely arbitrarily, just makes that up, says they have 60 days to negotiate. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1672.6s)]
*  Iran comes in going, okay, let's negotiate. How about we bring our enrichment levels down and we [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1677.8s)]
*  get back in the JCPOA and you drop some of the sanctions. And so they're trying to go. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1683.0s)]
*  And then the hawks insisted on putting in the poison pill that you have to have zero enrichment [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1688.12s)]
*  and you have to get rid of all your centrifuges and get rid of your civilian nuclear program [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1696.6s)]
*  entirely, which is like a totally ridiculous, you know, like it's a poison pill. It's a request that [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1700.28s)]
*  you know they can't give and you intentionally demand it to kill negotiations. And so this is [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1709.08s)]
*  what the hawks are always doing, right? So they kill the negotiations. Then on the 61st day, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1714.6s)]
*  Israel attacks. Now I'm saying even if casualties are minimized, let's say there are three Americans [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1719.08s)]
*  who get killed. You know, the hawks are going to use that to beat the war drums and look at [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1726.84s)]
*  Donald Trump and say, Trump, what are you a weak man or are you a big, tough, strong man who does [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1732.52s)]
*  something when Americans are killed? And this does seem to be the type of thing that actually [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1738.04s)]
*  moves Donald Trump. So anyway, just gaming all of that out. There was one other thing you said [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1742.28s)]
*  I wanted to respond to. Oh yeah. In terms of like how successful the strikes actually were. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1747.32s)]
*  And I've, you know, a few of my military buddies who really know what they're talking about here [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1757.08s)]
*  have confirmed this is true. This was kind of my, you know, gut instinct, but then I did get it [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1762.04s)]
*  confirmed by some people who actually, you know, have some expertise in with the subject matter. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1766.84s)]
*  But you're talking about doing these airstrikes alone with no forces on the ground. You have no [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1772.28s)]
*  idea what you got and what you didn't get. You need to send in ground forces to really know, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1779.9599999999998s)]
*  is there nuclear material left? Was nuclear material moved? Was this, I mean, you can have [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1785.6399999999999s)]
*  some intelligence, but this is going based off sources and it's low confidence type stuff. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1789.9599999999998s)]
*  And so even, I think the Pentagon did say that some of the nuclear material had been moved, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1796.04s)]
*  but you know, immediately after the strike, everyone, of course, Donald Trump, first and [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1801.24s)]
*  foremost is bragging about how successful they were and how it took out everything. The Iranians, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1806.04s)]
*  who are really the only ones who would know, they go, ah, it didn't do nothing. Didn't take out [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1811.96s)]
*  anything. We've moved all of the nuclear material. You know, who knows who's telling the truth there [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1816.28s)]
*  or not? Sorry, I shouldn't say that. Who knows if the Iranians are telling the truth? The Americans [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1822.92s)]
*  are just making it up. Donald Trump's administration is just saying it was very successful. But the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1827.48s)]
*  bottom line is that for all of us, we just don't know. We don't know what, you know, how much was [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1832.3600000000001s)]
*  achieved or not achieved by these strikes. And on that note, just explain to me, how are they 14 [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1837.72s)]
*  days away from breaking out? And then you take out three strategic targets and then you declare, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1842.92s)]
*  well, there's no longer any risk of a nuclear threat anymore. I mean, just rectify those two [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1847.8s)]
*  positions for me, particularly if you just kind of, you know, kick the bees hive here. And I guess [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1853.24s)]
*  potentially, I mean, you want to talk about the extreme upside, I guess it's that we flip Iran and [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1859.72s)]
*  they end up being a peaceful country and it's better for the people there. And the extreme risk [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1863.96s)]
*  side is that, you know, they end up acquiring material from North Korea to finish a bomb because [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1868.12s)]
*  they weren't actually interested in doing that until now. Or that Russia and Iran decide, hey, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1873.8799999999999s)]
*  we really don't like the way America's running around picking all these fights with our allies [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1878.36s)]
*  and we're going to step in and you know what, we're not at war with the US either, but we're [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1882.9199999999998s)]
*  going to start very strategically sending a lot of arms into Iran or helping them with their nuclear [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1886.2s)]
*  program. I just, I don't understand the claim of 14 days away from a bomb. Oh, we hit three targets [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1891.32s)]
*  and now mission accomplished. We no longer have to deal with this nuclear threat. And if the only [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1898.68s)]
*  thing you're concerned about was the nuclear threat, then I guess we don't have to even [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1904.04s)]
*  negotiate anymore. Can we just call it a day if it's mission accomplished and we're not at war with [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1907.16s)]
*  the regime, we're not at war with the people and we're just at war with the nuclear threat. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1911.64s)]
*  If you're going to tell me, hey, I mean, pull up a, go ahead. I mean, you can pull up the tweet and [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1914.92s)]
*  read the tweet. Donald Trump said mission accomplished. We're done. We did it. We took out the three [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1919.3200000000002s)]
*  strategic assets. So just some somebody, one of these Trump loyalists, tell me how these two [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1923.72s)]
*  things fit together of 14 days away, three targets hit. We know that we're done. It's bullshit. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1929.08s)]
*  Yeah, complete bullshit. And then of course, look, it's like with all of these things, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1935.24s)]
*  Donald Trump just speaks out of every side of his mouth and takes every position. So it's like [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1939.88s)]
*  completely incoherent. You don't even, but at the same time, it's like, no, listen, you just launched [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1945.96s)]
*  a war. So, and now you're talking about regime change. So like, what is it here? What's the goal? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1950.68s)]
*  And it is, you know, people, you know, it's just like, like I've been saying for the last few days, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1957.5600000000002s)]
*  even though, and you make the point about COVID, it is there, there are striking parallels there [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1966.1200000000001s)]
*  as well. And there's also just a ton of striking parallels between the war propaganda for almost [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1970.68s)]
*  all the wars and this one, but it is, I'm sorry, like the people falling for this one, you are [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1975.48s)]
*  so much worse than the people who fell forward in 2002 leading into 2003, because we got a 20 plus [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1981.8000000000002s)]
*  year track record now to look at and see all these people making these same claims with the same level [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1989.16s)]
*  of certainty. And then already we see them abandoning those claims and moving on to other claims and [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1994.6000000000001s)]
*  making them with the same certainty. It's just, it's ridiculous. But I mean, for people who, you [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=1999.48s)]
*  know, I still, you know, I mean, we got to see how this plays out. We'll see what happens with these [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2005.24s)]
*  Iranian strikes and then see what the response to that is and what the response to the response is. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2010.2s)]
*  But the idea that, that people look, I'd say, I still think at this point, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2014.84s)]
*  where things are right now. Yeah, I think it's, it's on, I find, I have to say, I don't think [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2019.56s)]
*  Donald Trump is really going to send the army in. Like you're talking real boots on the ground, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2029.72s)]
*  like that type of thing. I just, I imagine he's not going to, you know, just destroy, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2035.3999999999999s)]
*  destroy his presidency, which it certainly would do. There's no question about that. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2042.6s)]
*  If he is invading the country with the army, he has destroyed his presidency. He may have already, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2049.0s)]
*  you know, he's, he's really risking it. But the point is that the risk of being lured into that [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2054.2s)]
*  is just unacceptable as we're taking this risk of something that would be, you know, if you're [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2062.84s)]
*  talking about a regime change, which is what the commander in chief himself is saying now, and [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2067.64s)]
*  certainly what the Israelis want and what a lot of the Hawks have want and have wanted for, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2073.0s)]
*  for many years, many decades, you're talking, you know, it's like people, they get these like kind [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2079.16s)]
*  of goofy ideas. It's amazing how quickly, like when the war drums start beating or let me, you know [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2084.76s)]
*  what, let me actually tell this, this story, and then I'll get into the regime change stuff and what [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2091.08s)]
*  a regime change in Iran might actually look like or what it might take. But so I remember this, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2095.64s)]
*  I didn't do very, very well in college. School was never my thing. I was much better at learning [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2102.52s)]
*  outside of school than I ever was at learning inside of school. But I do remember this one [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2108.52s)]
*  moment and this, this was very interesting to me. So I, I graduated high school in 2002. So I, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2114.52s)]
*  I graduated high school and then started college in the year 2002, which was the year between, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2121.96s)]
*  you know, 9 11 happened 2001, the invasion of Iraq happened in 2003. So I went to, I went to college [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2129.16s)]
*  in the year, in the year that was post 9 11 with the, we had already invaded Afghanistan. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2136.3599999999997s)]
*  And then all through 2002 was the war drums beating for the war in Iraq. It was for people [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2143.16s)]
*  who are like a bit younger than me, like even you and Natalie are a bit younger than me. I don't [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2149.08s)]
*  know. You know, you were alive, Rob and not, you know, I guess Natalie was alive, but was very [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2156.52s)]
*  young. There's, it's hard to explain. I mean, if you think there's like war fever now, you know, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2160.52s)]
*  9 11 had just happened. America had been attacked and on the homeland, the war propaganda, the war [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2168.04s)]
*  fever was just insane. And so there was this, there was this one student at the college that I went [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2174.84s)]
*  to, he was living in the dorms with us and he was like an active duty military guy. And so he goes, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2180.52s)]
*  somehow the local paper of like this, you know, little town wanted to do like an interview with [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2190.2s)]
*  him because he was active duty military. He was getting ready to deploy. He said he was going off [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2197.32s)]
*  to, to, I think it was Afghanistan at the time, cause we hadn't yet invaded Iraq, but he was [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2203.56s)]
*  getting ready for, to like deploy and you know, everybody was so like gung ho rah rah. This was [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2208.12s)]
*  team America days, you know, America, like that's what that, that's what that movie was making fun [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2213.72s)]
*  of was that moment in time. And so the paper got excited and they did like a whole spread on them. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2219.4s)]
*  They put it on the front page of the newspaper and they took a picture of this guy with like his, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2224.2799999999997s)]
*  his like, he had like, you know, he was in his military fatigues and he had like semi-automatic [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2229.48s)]
*  rifle and they came into his dorm room and took these like cool, bad-ass looking pictures of him. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2233.88s)]
*  And then they wrote up a whole piece about him. Okay. And then it came out like two days after [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2238.28s)]
*  they wrote the piece that this kid was not in the military. This was not real at all. And in fact, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2244.6800000000003s)]
*  what they were dealing with was a lying fucking 19 year old with a gun within AK 47. I don't remember [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2254.36s)]
*  what the gun was. It wasn't, maybe it wasn't an AK 47. It might've been like an AR 15, but it was [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2263.08s)]
*  like a bad-ass fucking, you know, semi-automatic rifle on college campus. This is post Columbine, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2266.7599999999998s)]
*  by the way, we were already in the era of school shootings. You are not allowed to have a semi-automatic [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2274.52s)]
*  rifle on a dorm room. And yet the newspaper came in as he showed them their gun and went and took [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2279.64s)]
*  pictures and ran a puff story about it. He was making it up. He just bought some military fatigues. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2285.88s)]
*  He wasn't in the military at all. Anyway, no tragedy ended up happening. They retracted the [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2290.6s)]
*  story. He got kicked out of school. Don't know whatever ended up happening to that kid. My guess [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2295.96s)]
*  is nothing great, but it was, I remember there was this one professor and he was like one of the only [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2299.72s)]
*  professors who I really liked in a, at college. But I remember he, we were talking about this in [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2304.92s)]
*  class the next day and he goes, guys, you just lived through a great example of war fever. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2312.04s)]
*  It was people lose their minds. Like they just get so swept up in the whole thing that even [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2319.16s)]
*  people who are journalists by trait, like this is what, and this isn't like, you know, this isn't [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2326.2s)]
*  Chris Cuomo at CNN. Like these weren't like corporate hacks who are lying on behalf of the [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2331.88s)]
*  regime as a job. These were like, you know, people who write for the local newspaper in some town. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2337.3199999999997s)]
*  Like they were, but even they did not ask themselves the most basic questions. Like, wait a minute, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2343.0s)]
*  what? Like he's getting ready to go for deployment and they've already sent him his weaponry and [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2349.3199999999997s)]
*  uniform here at school. He's got the gun on college campus, open at a door. What? No one asked the [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2354.2s)]
*  most basic questions. And they ran the story, meaning like the editor saw it, the senior [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2360.68s)]
*  editor saw it. Like it was the front page of their little newspaper. Everybody imaginable, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2366.52s)]
*  who would have been the level to check there, they all signed off on it or whatever, didn't object [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2373.72s)]
*  to it. And so you just, it was just like a great example. And again, that doesn't mean that like, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2379.48s)]
*  maybe there is a scenario here where we can just be proven wrong. And I'm not trying to intentionally [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2386.7599999999998s)]
*  create a situation where I get to say I'm right no matter what. If the facts unfold in a way that I [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2393.3999999999996s)]
*  don't, that I didn't anticipate, I will certainly be the first to be like, I didn't admit that. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2398.68s)]
*  Believe me, I would love for this to have a non-catastrophic resolution where I look bad. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2403.3199999999997s)]
*  I will gladly take that. I've had enough wins in major policy areas that me and you have been [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2413.16s)]
*  completely right about Rob. So like, I'll take being wrong for this to not be the disaster that [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2419.7999999999997s)]
*  it could end up being. But you see, I've just lived through this movie so much. I guess this is what [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2425.7999999999997s)]
*  wisdom is. You're just like, you're like, no, I don't know. I've seen this. I've seen it over [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2431.96s)]
*  and over again. And the war fever, people are talking about how we're going to have a regime [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2436.76s)]
*  change with a few airstrikes. All right. I've never seen that before. Never seen that. And I [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2443.16s)]
*  think we were picking on some regimes that were not as tough as this one. I mean, look, just to [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2450.84s)]
*  keep this in perspective, look, even in Libya, we had a full NATO no-fly zone. We had CIA and [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2456.76s)]
*  special forces or special ops on the ground. It wasn't just, you know what I mean? Like, oh, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2463.88s)]
*  a couple targeted strikes and the regime fell. And I'm sorry, but the president's talking about [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2470.28s)]
*  regime change. And I don't want to be one of the people who are like, you know, hysterically just [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2474.76s)]
*  reacting to what Trump said. But this is important enough that you got to kind of take it seriously. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2478.44s)]
*  So just for some reference, right? Like for those people who know, and even if you're not like [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2483.0s)]
*  really, you know, like well read in the history of all this stuff, you do, you know, like how we, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2488.68s)]
*  we were talking about the, um, uh, what's it called? The Gulf War in the nineties against Iraq, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2494.36s)]
*  right? I like, is everybody knows on some, or at least I think most of you guys know, right? Like [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2501.64s)]
*  George H. W. Bush launched a war in Iraq and then George W. Bush launched a war in Iraq. Okay. And [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2505.88s)]
*  both of them fought the war against Saddam Hussein. So like just pointing out that even invading the [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2512.52s)]
*  country, Saddam Hussein held onto power, right? Like there wasn't even a successful regime change [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2519.0s)]
*  in 91. Now you could certainly argue that they could have overthrown, uh, Saddam Hussein and [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2525.48s)]
*  opted not to. I think that is the case. They decided not to go into Baghdad and overthrow him. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2532.04s)]
*  That's true, but I'm just making the point that like he, here you had a Sunni minority [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2537.64s)]
*  country with a, a Sunni dictator over ruling over a super majority of Shiite Muslims who were not [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2545.0s)]
*  fans of his, you know, it's like all these people talking about the Iranian people don't like their [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2554.52s)]
*  government. Therefore what is even with Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator whose people did not [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2558.6s)]
*  very much like him and an invasion from the U S army still didn't overthrow the regime. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2566.2s)]
*  He still held onto power for another decade, um, or a little over a decade, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2574.04s)]
*  you know, like the idea that, oh, we're just going to hit these sites and then [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2581.48s)]
*  the regime will be changed and then everything will work out. Well, seems like, um, more [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2585.7999999999997s)]
*  something out of the realm of science fiction or fantasy than any honest, like military assessment [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2592.84s)]
*  of what might happen as a result of limited aerial strikes. So the people like there's, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2600.1200000000003s)]
*  there's this big circle that cannot be squared of we took them all out. The job is over. We're [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2607.0s)]
*  also calling for regime change. And then the people saying, they're like, oh no, no, no, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2613.48s)]
*  we're not saying we'll do the regime change. We're just saying like the people will do the [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2618.44s)]
*  regime change or something like that. It's like, well, why would, why would some precision strikes [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2622.36s)]
*  that take out key nuclear facilities, if that's what we're being told is happening, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2630.44s)]
*  why would that lead to the people rising up and overthrowing the regime any more than the people [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2635.32s)]
*  could have just risen up and overthrown the regime yesterday or a year ago or 10 years ago? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2640.84s)]
*  Uh, this regime has been holding onto power since this regime is four years older than me. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2646.36s)]
*  They're 45 years old. I'm 42. Uh, this, they've been holding onto power for quite a while. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2654.68s)]
*  And the idea that a few precision strikes are going to somehow lead to, you know, I don't know, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2663.4s)]
*  is it like the most charitable way to say it? I think that is wishful thinking. Let's say I'll tone [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2668.92s)]
*  down my normal rhetoric. That seems to be wishful thinking as far as I'm concerned. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2674.28s)]

*  I don't know, Rob, any thoughts? Well, the Trump loyalists seem to have absolute faith in Donald [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2764.6s)]
*  Trump at all times, even if he contradicts himself 48 hours after he said the initial statement that [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2769.7999999999997s)]
*  they defended the hell out of. So yeah, there seems to be some rosy picture being presented here [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2775.08s)]
*  of American strength is going to get them to just acquiesce to our will. I'm loving this statement [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2781.0s)]
*  and by loving it. I mean, the whole the situation is tragic, in my point of view, but the statements [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2786.36s)]
*  by JD Vance and because Trump's actually not really giving his pitch, he's got his minions out [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2791.0s)]
*  selling the arm and he's just saying crazy shit on Twitter. But basically where we are now is listen, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2796.76s)]
*  they just saw the strength of the United States of America. And while we're not at war with them, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2802.36s)]
*  they're just going to give up without having the war. They're just going to come back, they're [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2807.56s)]
*  going to meet all of our demands. They're going to trust us. And everything that we want will be [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2810.6s)]
*  given to us because we're the mighty United States of America and we have no interest in a fight, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2815.4s)]
*  but we're not saying we're not going to fight them. And what happens if they decide to shut down the [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2819.56s)]
*  straight of I think it's her muse or whatever. I got her moves. Yeah, the streets are used. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2823.7200000000003s)]
*  And what happens if they strike United States military base? Well, they know they know not to [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2827.7200000000003s)]
*  because they know that we're going to come at them with even more strength. Can you clarify [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2831.64s)]
*  what that means that we're going to come? No, because it's not even going to get there because [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2835.56s)]
*  they just witnessed what we'll do to them. And they know that we're serious about this. And it's [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2839.0s)]
*  like I just it it insults my intelligence. Give me some straight answers. What is the plan here? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2843.08s)]
*  Because it seems like you guys just want an all out war. And what's the intelligence that you guys [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2848.6s)]
*  think you can actually win it? How much is it going to cost us? And of course, they're not going to [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2853.24s)]
*  give us any of these answers. Yeah, it's like, again, you also have it's almost like a situation [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2856.84s)]
*  where if you I don't know, let's just like hypothetically say like you had a problem with [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2865.32s)]
*  your car. And like a mechanic was like, listen, like there's, there's like a 1% chance to say [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2872.44s)]
*  there's one one out of 100. So 1% chance that if you if you try to drive this thing without fixing [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2882.6800000000003s)]
*  it, it's going to explode and kill everybody in it. And then you're like, you're at home. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2889.16s)]
*  And you were like, you know, your wife was like, I'm gonna run to the grocery store, I would take [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2895.3999999999996s)]
*  the kids with me. And you're like, well, you can't drive the car. Because there's we have to have it [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2899.56s)]
*  fixed before anyone can drive it. There's a 1% chance that it kills you and the kids, you know, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2904.12s)]
*  and your wife was like, Well, I just really want to get some food from the grocery store. And you [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2908.52s)]
*  were like, Do we need groceries? Like, are we out of food? And she's like, No, the house is stocked [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2914.3599999999997s)]
*  up. I just want to go, you know, there's no real reason for me to go. You can see where you'd be [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2918.28s)]
*  like, No, absolutely not. You cannot take that risk. Even if it's only one out of 100. You cannot [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2922.6000000000004s)]
*  take that risk. It's just like it's totally reckless. And there's no benefit. There's no need [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2928.92s)]
*  for it. So just don't do that. And, you know, by the way, I would put the the odds of a catastrophe [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2934.28s)]
*  here at much higher than 1% much, much higher. We're we're look, even just now, I mean, today, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2941.1600000000003s)]
*  and I don't know exactly what this means. But Russia was moving subs like close to the English [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2947.4s)]
*  Channel. You've got all types of different possibilities that could come out of this. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2952.36s)]
*  Like, I don't know if you were reading up on this, Rob. But we have now we have no allies in Asia [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2956.6s)]
*  over this fight. Japan and and was it South Korea? Definitely Japan came out and totally blasted the [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2964.84s)]
*  thing was like, Yo, what is Israel in America doing? Like, why are you starting another war [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2971.64s)]
*  right now? There's, you know, you've got a very different global order than we had even at the [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2976.44s)]
*  beginning of the war on terrorism. I mean, the global order shifted around quite a bit over the [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2984.44s)]
*  Ukraine War. And it again, it's just the the risks of these of course, now Russia obviously has taken [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2988.76s)]
*  some provocative stances here. I don't know if you saw the thing where they were talking about [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=2996.52s)]
*  given nukes to Iran. Now that I, I highly doubt that's going to happen. That would be quite a [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3000.68s)]
*  first. If you had a nuclear country just giving nuclear weapons to a member of the non-proliferation [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3009.24s)]
*  treaty, you know, all right, I'm not saying I think that's going to happen. But the point is, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3016.2799999999997s)]
*  it's a signal. It's it's Russia sending a signal that they're also very unhappy about what's going [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3019.96s)]
*  on here. And keep in mind that Russia did intervene when America was trying to overthrow [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3025.16s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad and prevented it at least temporarily from from happening. So there's just [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3031.0s)]
*  there's so many like there there are substantially higher risks than just in Iraq War. But when you [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3038.52s)]
*  talk about look when you when you talk about a regime change, you're like, that doesn't [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3049.88s)]
*  necessarily mean it's going to be an Iraq style invasion of the army. I mean, that's not what we [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3054.6800000000003s)]
*  had in Libya or Syria, or Yemen, for that matter. You know, they were catastrophic nonetheless. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3060.28s)]
*  It's like, okay, they did not involve, you know, spending $2 trillion and losing thousands of our [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3069.88s)]
*  soldiers. But, you know, overthrowing Muammar Qaddafi did destroy the country, destabilize [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3076.36s)]
*  the region. It was a huge component of the migrant crisis into Europe. Bashar al-Assad, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3083.96s)]
*  I mean, a nightmare that civil war turned into hundreds of thousands of people died. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3090.44s)]
*  The country is now run by Al Qaeda and ISIS. It's like, you know, there's there's very bad [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3096.36s)]
*  possibilities. But again, of course, with a regime like Iran, a regime change [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3104.12s)]
*  seems like it would require much more than with those others. Maybe I'm wrong about that. But [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3113.08s)]
*  it certainly seems that way. And then this is the other even look, with this war, you have risks [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3117.88s)]
*  that are way higher than even with Iraq or Afghanistan, they simply just did not pose [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3124.36s)]
*  the technical threats that the Iranian regime is capable of. And we're seeing that already, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3130.84s)]
*  right? Like this, this right now, even just Israel being bombed and people being killed by Israel, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3139.2400000000002s)]
*  and all everybody having their security at the highest alert and US bases now being having [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3144.28s)]
*  missiles launched at them. Again, we'll see as the reporting comes out what exactly happened. But you [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3150.52s)]
*  might notice this is different than any of the other terror wars. This is that never happened [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3154.6s)]
*  in any of them. And so like, okay, we're already dealing with something different. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3159.56s)]
*  And even if this does not become a wider, like global confrontation, we, you know, as you mentioned [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3163.64s)]
*  that I had brought up, we're simply, I don't think we're in a situation where we really can risk that. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3174.92s)]
*  And I think that's something that that the American people should really grapple with. Like, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3182.12s)]
*  let's just say hypothetically, let's say we wanted to launch another Iraq style or Afghanistan style [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3189.08s)]
*  war right now. I think it's a very reasonable question to ask, could we? Could we do that? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3196.36s)]
*  I'm not so sure we could. Like, you know, those those wars had a profound damaging effect on our [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3204.6s)]
*  country. Then and, you know, economically, culturally, spiritually, like it was very, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3213.56s)]
*  very bad for our country. And are you telling me that it's so obvious that we could do another [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3222.2799999999997s)]
*  Iraq right now? Like, you think we could just go blow another few trillion dollars and lose thousands [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3228.2799999999997s)]
*  of our bravest guys and destabilize a region and have protests and all that comes with it? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3235.32s)]
*  I gotta say, if it were to turn into something like that, I'm also, I'm very concerned about what [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3241.48s)]
*  that is going to look like here in our country. You know, it's like really start adding up like [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3248.84s)]
*  all the different costs in your mind. First of all, the the new media landscape is something [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3255.7200000000003s)]
*  that will have to be dealt with. If we do launch another war of that nature, they're just not going [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3263.2400000000002s)]
*  to be able to have all the people like us out there talking all this shit. And they are not, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3269.64s)]
*  they are going to have to put the protest down. They're going to have to put down the people who [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3274.7599999999998s)]
*  are speaking out against the war. You know, for all the talk we've heard over the last two years, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3279.0s)]
*  Rob, about the dangerous rise of anti-Semitism, what do you think that looks like? Let us, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3285.48s)]
*  let us launch another war now that is just nakedly for Israel. It's not even like the other ones where [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3291.0s)]
*  they had a little bit of a cover story, just one where we're just straight up, we are going to war [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3298.6s)]
*  for Israel right now, even though all of the American people don't want it. Or, you know, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3302.44s)]
*  super majorities of the American people don't want it. I just don't know, I don't know how that would [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3307.16s)]
*  look. And I'm really goddamn, I am really hoping that this does not escalate to something like that. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3312.04s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Blackout [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3318.8399999999997s)]

*  Yeah, I saw, I found this to be kind of interesting. Actually, let me just pull it up so I can read the [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3380.6s)]
*  exact numbers here. But so Charlie Kirk, who runs Turning Point USA, which is, you know, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3387.4s)]
*  really Donald Trump's kind of young people ground game. I mean, Charlie Kirk has been a truly [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3397.24s)]
*  consequential influential person in all of this. Like they go out, they have chapters all over the [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3408.28s)]
*  country and they got certainly hundreds of thousands, if not millions of young people to [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3414.6800000000003s)]
*  be Republicans and support Donald Trump and all of this. And he's very, you know, anyway, it's just [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3421.6400000000003s)]
*  his audience is very bad. So he posted a Twitter poll. Now, of course, this is not a scientific poll [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3426.28s)]
*  that should be obvious. But nonetheless, it's kind of interesting, you know, he got three as of right [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3431.96s)]
*  now, it has 311,000 plus people who have voted in this. And this was, you know, so, again, not [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3437.7200000000003s)]
*  scientific, but this is Charlie Kirk's audience, it's kind of interesting to see where they would [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3448.2s)]
*  be. And the question was, do you support US led regime change removing the Iranian mullahs? And of [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3451.96s)]
*  this right now, it is just under 70%, 69% say no. And about 30% say yes. And I did think that was [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3458.28s)]
*  somewhat interesting. Particularly just because Donald Trump just came out and endorsed the idea [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3468.36s)]
*  of regime change. And so it's just interesting to still see even in that environment, that, you know, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3475.4s)]
*  70% of Charlie Kirk's, you know, followers are like, no, we don't want that. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3481.8s)]
*  And that's that's didn't actually endorse a regime change. He's going to make Iran great again. I mean, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3492.12s)]
*  your inability to trust in Donald Trump or see the eight D chess or the plan in play, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3499.1600000000003s)]
*  because he has no interest in regime change. He just wants he wants Iran to be great. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3504.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's that's the new that's what everyone voted for, right? Make Iran [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3509.08s)]
*  great again. Nobody I mean, you know, the the regime change tweet that I'm referring to, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3514.2000000000003s)]
*  like he also just straight up endorsed regime change. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3518.2000000000003s)]
*  I said that it's a politically incorrect to call it regime change, we're going to make but we are [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3520.84s)]
*  going to make Iran great again. Yeah, here, let me [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3526.2000000000003s)]
*  because I really the only way that America can be great is if Israel has made great first. And so [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3529.2400000000002s)]
*  now in order to make Israel safe, we need Iran to be great. So you know, well, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3535.4s)]
*  yes, well, let me read the exact Donald Trump quote here. It's not politically correct to use [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3541.1600000000003s)]
*  the term regime change. But if the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again, why [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3548.84s)]
*  wouldn't there be a regime change? Mega? Well, if you'd allow me to say Donald Trump, mega, please. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3556.68s)]
*  What a ridiculous Well, again, it's just like all the it's like with all these wars, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3569.3199999999997s)]
*  like they always just they do this thing all the time, right? Where they just, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3575.48s)]
*  like they just imply it. Like, technically speaking, I guess he didn't say he's for [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3580.28s)]
*  regime change. But it's like, he said, Why wouldn't there be a regime change, even though it's [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3586.44s)]
*  politically incorrect? Like, also, like, that's not what politically incorrect means. Is that [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3591.48s)]
*  politically incorrect to say regime change? It's just that after 25 years of disastrous regime [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3597.64s)]
*  changes, the American people don't support one. It's like, I don't know what this That's what he [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3605.32s)]
*  means. Yes. Yes. Right. It means it's unpopular. It means people know that everything before and [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3610.6000000000004s)]
*  after that statement is almost always a lie from the people who are trying to sell it. But yeah, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3616.76s)]
*  it's a look, man, this is, we'll see what comes next. Obviously, whatever is going on right now, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3622.6800000000003s)]
*  as we speak, is going to play a huge role in that. But it is been in on it. It's been an [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3630.44s)]
*  unbelievable period just the last week of watching how quickly like how quickly people have jumped [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3637.08s)]
*  on board with this new war, how quickly they've been celebrating the success of it before it is [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3646.36s)]
*  even kind of clear that there's been any success whatsoever. And as I open the show, I suppose I'll [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3651.7200000000003s)]
*  close it with the same thing. I just, I've never quite seen. I've seen many, many times, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3659.16s)]
*  like, where there's like a propaganda campaign for some horrible government policy, and then it [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3666.8399999999997s)]
*  turns out to all have been lies. And then they move the goalposts. And then they have a new, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3673.56s)]
*  you know, they have a new justification for the same policy that is different than the old [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3678.2s)]
*  justification all this. I don't think I've ever seen one where it has been this quick, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3681.8799999999997s)]
*  where the propaganda has moved the goalposts so quickly that literally it's just like, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3687.96s)]
*  like I was arguing with some people on Twitter and literally had the moment where you're like, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3693.56s)]
*  but that's not what you were arguing yesterday. Yesterday, you and me had this argument. Do you [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3698.04s)]
*  remember that? Remember yesterday when your argument was America won't be getting involved. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3706.44s)]
*  Israel can do it on its own. Remember that? It's like, it is truly crazy. And then of course, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3712.52s)]
*  the charity kick was that all of them going on the Sunday talk shows talking about, nobody's [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3718.36s)]
*  talking about regime change. And then Donald Trump just throws them all under the bus, essentially, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3722.52s)]
*  and goes, I'm going to say it regime change. They listen, by the way, we didn't, I got to end the [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3727.64s)]
*  show here, but he also has just been going at Thomas Massey talking shit. But honestly, I don't [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3733.7200000000003s)]
*  know. I don't even think we really have to have like that big of an argument here. Donald Trump [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3739.8s)]
*  and Thomas Massey, you know, we can all agree to disagree. Obviously, like, listen, the thing about [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3745.2400000000002s)]
*  it is, is that the Thomas Massey is like, we are we like him, but that's we're in different movement. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3750.44s)]
*  Like we're in the MAGA movement. But Donald Trump, of course, is the leader of the mega [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3757.88s)]
*  movement. And I wish the mega movement best of luck. But I want no part of it, no part of it [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3762.1200000000003s)]
*  whatsoever. Before we call our show, let me plug it's the last vestige of freedom in this country [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3768.28s)]
*  is that you can porch tour with me. I got up in Raleigh, North Carolina, Hempstead, North Carolina, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY72BuhAIXE&t=3773.1600000000003s)]
