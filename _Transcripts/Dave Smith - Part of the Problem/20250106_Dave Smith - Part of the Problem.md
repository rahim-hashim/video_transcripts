*  Well if I knew that that I wouldn't be getting these complaints now would I rob? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=61.16s)]
*  However you say that we will be there hurt, so that's really what's important [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=65.03999999999999s)]

*  Austin Texas so a bunch of stuff the ticket links are all coming together now [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=111.2s)]
*  I think I just put out a flyer that was missing a few of the dates [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=116.12s)]
*  But I saw I saw people out there on Twitter. They were like oh, I thought you were coming to Denver [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=118.8s)]
*  It's not on the thing. We are coming to Denver. Don't worry [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=122.68s)]
*  We're coming all over the place there you go clip it clip it for the gay comment [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=125.76s)]
*  But comic Dave Smith comm for all of those ticket links for the shows me and Rob are doing together [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=130.4s)]
*  And the ones that are missing should be up very soon all right [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=134.64s)]
*  so Rob as [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=139.36s)]
*  Well, you know maybe I'll start with this but [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=141.76s)]
*  there's okay, there's a couple topics that are kind of on the same broader theme, but I I [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=146.36s)]
*  Just look obviously [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=153.64s)]
*  We do not on this podcast [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=156.24s)]
*  And I speak for both of us when when I say this and I I've always been clear about this [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=158.52s)]
*  I've always been on record and both of us have [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=164.32s)]
*  We do not care about Canada [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=167.52s)]
*  That's we don't care [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Not it's just come on. There's enough going on with the internal politics of the United States of America [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=175.84s)]
*  I cannot reasonably be asked to keep up with Canada. They're just later Mexicans. That's the way I see them. Yeah and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=181.44s)]
*  Meaning they're a problem okay, and they have to be dealt with however [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=190.56s)]
*  There there were two things okay number one today, we are recording on January 6th 2025 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=195.28s)]
*  today [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=203.16s)]
*  Justin Trudeau resigned on January 6th, okay on January 6th [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=204.32s)]
*  Justin Trudeau resigned from government [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=210.76s)]
*  Also this same day the vote to certify the election of 2024 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=214.28s)]
*  Is being certified in Congress in the Senate and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=221.0s)]
*  Which rarely happens? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  You know the vice president is [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  technically the president of the Senate and so Kamala Harris has [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=231.32s)]
*  For the last few days had to who oversee [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=236.0s)]
*  Her own election loss. I had not really thought about things in this term in these terms [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=240.27999999999997s)]
*  But it was I guess Al Gore is the last [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=246.44s)]
*  Sitting vice president to run and lose [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  And so about 25 years ago [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=254.16s)]
*  Al Gore was in the same situation anyway [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=258.08s)]
*  All I'm saying is to our listeners out there to to see Kamala Harris having to oversee the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=261.32s)]
*  certification of her own election defeat and to see [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=268.6s)]
*  Justin Trudeau have to resign on January 6th [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=272.52s)]
*  All I'm saying Rob is that there are still people out there who don't believe in God [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=276.24s)]
*  And this is a rough day for you. This is how can you I don't I know there are bad things in the world [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=281.56s)]
*  I know there's a lot to be [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=287.92s)]
*  Depressed about but how can you not look at that and go clearly there is a higher being with a sense of humor [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=289.96s)]
*  guiding events of humanity [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=298.12s)]
*  That's all I'm saying yeah Trump gets to take a nice victory lap before showing up for hush money court, but [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=300.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Yeah [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=306.24s)]
*  That's right. So and when did they they moved that back a few days, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=308.76s)]
*  It was supposed to have already been done [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  But then the judge insisted that he come and now from last [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=314.8s)]
*  I read his lawyers are trying to get it Trump's lawyers that is are trying to get it pushed back further [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=317.92s)]
*  But we'll see what happens with all that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=321.76s)]
*  I guess it's just not gonna be all that consequential [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=324.36s)]
*  Everyone who's aware of the court case people voted for him anyways, it's kind of cartoonish the guy has a job to go do now [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=327.36s)]
*  So I don't know why [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=334.36s)]
*  Formally sentencing him with some sort of a slap in the wrist helps him on the way into the presidency [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=335.88s)]
*  But on the same note, it's kind of like I was advocating for even if Fauci gets a pardon [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=341.48s)]
*  Let's prosecute him anyways [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=345.56s)]
*  So from that judge's opinion even if this guy's let off the hook because he's got presidential immunity [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=346.68s)]
*  We should formally hand him a punishment [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=351.88s)]
*  Yeah, well look I mean I I'm with you on that one [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=354.08s)]
*  Let's go so like a few, you know, I guess it's it's worth kind of I think kind of talking about [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=358.32s)]
*  Just a couple things on Trudeau and on January 6th. So first of all [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=365.84s)]
*  You know, I was I was celebrating a bit on Twitter about Justin Trudeau [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=372.24s)]
*  You know stepping down and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=378.44s)]
*  I hope he ends up working a glory hole for those truckers [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=381.32s)]
*  Well, that's that would be perhaps a fair punishment. I I'm not holding my breath on that one [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=387.04s)]
*  But it really is like, you know, I had people tweeting to me they're like no the move [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=398.68s)]
*  He just pulled is actually prolonging his party's rule in government and then talking about how his opponent is really bad, too [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=403.24s)]
*  And all of this stuff and I'm again, I'm not claiming to have any level of knowledge about Canadian politics [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=409.72s)]
*  I just don't follow it and I'm I'm already I [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=415.88000000000005s)]
*  Already have my work cut out for me just being up to date on the stuff that we talk about so it is what it is [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  but I would just say from [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  from the perspective of someone a US citizen observing Canada, it's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=430.6s)]
*  I'm not saying you know, cuz I'm not saying like I I am up to date on what's happening [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=436.96s)]
*  And I don't know maybe all of that is true what people are saying on Twitter [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=441.44s)]
*  But from my perspective it is there is something invaluable [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  about the guy [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=449.56s)]
*  Who oversaw the COVID insanity in Canada, which was [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  believe it or not [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=457.32s)]
*  Quite a bit more insane than the United States of America's COVID insanity [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=459.0s)]
*  Maybe you could maybe you could say it's it was on par with the worst parts of America [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=464.52s)]
*  So the ones that overreacted the most it was a country of Los Angeles or a country of New York City or something like that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=470.96s)]
*  but the guy who [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=478.24s)]
*  So clearly I mean, you know [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=480.08s)]
*  invoked emergency powers to [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=483.52s)]
*  confiscate [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=486.52s)]
*  Or should I say confiscate to freeze the bank accounts not just of the truckers who were protesting but of people who were accused of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=488.12s)]
*  financially supporting the truckers [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=497.52s)]
*  With no due process mind you so on the accusation your bank account was frozen [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=499.68s)]
*  It was truly one of the most chilling and tyrannical policies in the civilized world [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=505.28s)]
*  in certainly in my lifetime probably quite a bit more than that and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=512.36s)]
*  Just to see that guy's [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=517.08s)]
*  I was gonna say presidency, but I guess that's the wrong word [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=519.88s)]
*  But to see his term and in like a humiliating embarrassment is invaluable [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=523.28s)]
*  It's great and and that I'm not claiming to know any more about it than that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=529.88s)]
*  But I do know what he was doing during COVID and it is wonderful to see him, you know [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=534.9200000000001s)]
*  To see him have to make that speech announcing that he's stepping down screw that guy [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  That's really all the extent of what I have to say about it. Any thoughts on the late Prime Minister Trudeau [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=546.3s)]
*  Well, I won't miss him except I will miss when random people kind of psych him out and go [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=552.46s)]
*  Oh my god Trudeau and then he gets all excited. Hey, and then they go you're a fucking dickhead [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=558.38s)]
*  and then he's just [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=563.78s)]
*  scurry off because every time he gets excited that he's being recognized and he thinks he's a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=564.98s)]
*  Well-liked celebrity so I will miss that I and I you know COVID regime all that nonsense [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=569.66s)]
*  But it seems like Trump just collected his first soul and that perhaps is his tariff plays might actually work out or some of them [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=575.34s)]
*  Maybe this will invigorate him of look how good my tariffs are and then they'll backfire [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=583.34s)]
*  But it seems like he's won one and one and oh [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=588.7s)]
*  Against world leaders and threatening tariffs and that he just caused someone their jobs [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=591.74s)]
*  So in terms of inflicting plain for concessions and then understanding that, you know [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=595.3000000000001s)]
*  World leaders are just kind of looking out for their best interests [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=600.7s)]
*  It seems like he just he just took one out [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=603.8599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's certainly look if nothing else that it can certainly be spun that way [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=607.14s)]
*  And it just looks good for Donald Trump whether you know, whether fairly or unfairly [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=613.0999999999999s)]
*  Perhaps had Trump not won everything would have happened exactly the same as as it did happen [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=619.4599999999999s)]
*  But either way in the same way that it's not exactly fair [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=625.9799999999999s)]
*  That Donald Trump getting shot in the earlobe, you know makes him look so badass [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=631.78s)]
*  the same week that [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=637.74s)]
*  Biden looked so old and frail [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=640.02s)]
*  Nonetheless, that's the appearance and that's the reality that we're living in and like there's no question that just that it's not just [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=642.78s)]
*  Trump threatening them with with [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=650.22s)]
*  With tariffs and stuff, but it's it's Donald Trump publicly floating out the idea that they could become the 51st state [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=653.34s)]
*  Just totally like chopping Trudeau's balls off in the public negotiation, which Trump really is a master at that [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=660.38s)]
*  and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=667.66s)]
*  that you know, it's [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=668.86s)]
*  Him having to resign after that the appearances just are what they are and it's yeah [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=671.62s)]
*  I see every MAGA influencer taking a victory lap on this and it's I must admit it's pretty entertaining to watch [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=675.9399999999999s)]
*  So whether or not it was exactly Donald Trump's, you know accomplishment [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=682.14s)]
*  It sure is gonna play that way and it sure does you know make him look great and make the entire [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=686.3399999999999s)]
*  You know, it's a blow to the entire progressive [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=694.14s)]
*  Establishment those who branded themselves the resistance under Donald Trump's first four years [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=698.14s)]
*  It's just a huge blow to all of them that so many and I've found this to be [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=703.3399999999999s)]
*  you know, uh [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=708.9799999999999s)]
*  It's an interesting theme how many of these people who are like [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=710.38s)]
*  heroes of the progressive resistance of Donald Trump just [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=715.98s)]
*  It's the shortest reign [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=720.46s)]
*  I mean, they're like heroic and then they just collapse and then when you look back at it [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=722.38s)]
*  You can't believe that anybody ever thought they were that thing [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=726.98s)]
*  During covid there were a lot of these obviously Andrew Cuomo Fauci himself [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=731.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean Fauci was for a little while there a figure that was almost [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=736.54s)]
*  Portrayed as above politics, you know, this was just the expert [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=742.02s)]
*  This was just the scientist and now he's you know at best one of the most controversial figures [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=745.82s)]
*  But there's just a lot of guys like this in Trudeau really was one of them [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=753.34s)]
*  It's interesting when I say one of them [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=756.98s)]
*  I mean like if you remember Rob because I used to make a big deal about this on the show because I just thought it [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=759.78s)]
*  hilarious and so revealing [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=765.54s)]
*  but there was a [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=767.9799999999999s)]
*  Michael Avenatti, I believe I'm saying his name correctly, but he was Stormy Daniels lawyer and [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=770.54s)]
*  For quite a while the corporate media was touting him as a potential presidential candidate in [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=777.5s)]
*  2020 and this was because he was going on the cable news shows and he was like given all the you know [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=785.26s)]
*  He was he was like ruthlessly [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=790.3399999999999s)]
*  Indicating Donald Trump on cable news and of course he was doing this because his client was Stormy Daniels [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=793.1s)]
*  She was trying to get money. She was trying to sue Donald Trump [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=799.1800000000001s)]
*  He was being a lawyer, you know [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=801.1800000000001s)]
*  But they all just felt and and they're so there it's such a sick culture and they're so removed from regular people that [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=802.5400000000001s)]
*  they [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=810.98s)]
*  While they're celebrating him [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=812.0600000000001s)]
*  It didn't seem to dawn on any of them that he was [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=814.58s)]
*  Transparently a piece of shit like just the guy was obvious anybody who first of all [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=819.22s)]
*  He's a fucking lawyer who's representing a porn star. I mean [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=825.0600000000001s)]
*  Try starting from a place of where you're more likely to be sleazy than that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=830.3000000000001s)]
*  You know what? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=835.62s)]
*  I mean like the lawyer representing a porn star by the way not representing a porn star who was you know? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=836.34s)]
*  assaulted or abused or taken advantage of like a porn star who [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=841.9s)]
*  Voluntarily slept with a guy and voluntarily accepted hush money payments and then broke the deal and now wants to you know [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=846.88s)]
*  what I mean like it was just and he's of course just like [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=854.42s)]
*  Any normal person would take a look at him and be like yo that is the slimmiest person I've ever seen [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=857.68s)]
*  But they it didn't matter because they're so blinded by their hatred of Trump and they also don't have normal values and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=864.28s)]
*  So they were just like oh this guy's great. And then what I forget [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=871.48s)]
*  He ended up going to jail for some shit Keith fuck it was just like oh what a shock that slimeball is a slimeball [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=874.2s)]
*  You know and there were lots of other examples of stuff like this [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=880.52s)]
*  The other one that I love to use was beta war Rourke [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=885.5600000000001s)]
*  If you remember beta war Rourke was being touted for a while by the corporate media as the one with the quote it factor [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=888.6s)]
*  That's what they kept saying. He's got that it factor. He's just young and cool [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=896.12s)]
*  And I mean all you know like a normal person looks at him for five seconds and at the very least you go [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=900.36s)]
*  He's the biggest dork on the planet. Like this guy is just not no he's gonna take Texas [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=906.36s)]
*  Happen more like the it factor [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=913.84s)]
*  There you go. There you go Rob Rob in the fire [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=916.5600000000001s)]
*  But right like it was and and it there's something and Trudeau was one of those guys too like it's like they [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=920.64s)]
*  You know, there's a weird thing I remember like okay, I'm showing my age here, but I remember [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=927.88s)]
*  Being a little kid. I was a very little kid, but I was a little kid through the height of vanilla ice [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=934.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, so vanilla ice ice ice baby [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=940.6s)]
*  Was like a huge hit song he became for a brief moment there like the number one selling [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=944.16s)]
*  Rapper of all time a rap had never really like crossed over to the mainstream [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=951.44s)]
*  The way it did when vanilla ice came out, you know back then there were like big rappers [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=957.08s)]
*  I think the biggest was MC Hammer [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=963.36s)]
*  And then there were other people who like today you might actually consider a rapper like no no one today [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=966.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't think is really like who's into hip-hop is talking about MC Hammer and vanilla ice [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=972.8000000000001s)]
*  But there were like LL Cool J and Big Daddy Kane and guys like that, but they were much smaller [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=976.36s)]
*  They didn't sell the records that like anyway, so vanilla ice is just this huge thing and then it was like I swear [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=981.5600000000001s)]
*  It felt like one person made fun of how he's corny and then everyone just went. Oh, yeah. Oh [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=987.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he is really corny and that was the end of it [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=995.24s)]
*  It was like he went from being the number one guy to being a punchline like seemingly overnight [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=998.48s)]
*  At least this was the perspective of a six-year-old [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1002.88s)]
*  Anyway [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1005.2s)]
*  There is something about guys like Trudeau and guys like Beto O'Rourke [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1006.84s)]
*  Where it's almost like the media can come in and be like now [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1012.76s)]
*  This is a really cool like young hip guy and then it almost he takes one person to go like he's a fucking dork [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1015.04s)]
*  Before everyone's like yeah [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1022.96s)]
*  Hey, it's a dork. Anyway, I just thought Trudeau was Trudeau really was one of these guys who the media was [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1025.12s)]
*  Presenting as like, you know, he's brilliant and handsome and young and oh if only America could have a leader like this leader and [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1033.0s)]
*  I don't know. I just I find it to be [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1042.1999999999998s)]
*  Incredibly positive that he goes out looking like a chump and not like whatever they were trying to make him into also [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1046.28s)]
*  He might be Castro's kid. I'm not sure about that, but he might be all right guys [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1054.0s)]

*  Who had a he was accused by someone of? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1197.8s)]
*  Of living in a bubble and we were talking about that like what that accusation really means what it means to say someone lives [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1201.4s)]
*  In a bubble and I was saying to him that I think I think if we're being honest [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1208.0s)]
*  We kind of all live in bubbles to some degree [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1212.0600000000002s)]
*  Obviously some more than others and some live in different bubbles [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1216.12s)]
*  But there's no question that like Rob me and you when we go out and do live shows [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1219.2s)]
*  It's predominantly for people who listen to this show and on social media and things like that [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1224.08s)]
*  Your algorithm is feeding you who you interact with and so you kind of get a view of your world [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1230.72s)]
*  It's a little bit tougher [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  It's part of the reason why I still do keep my eye on the corporate media and why I do try to consume other [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1238.32s)]
*  Media because you want to keep a perspective on what this group is thinking or what this group is thinking [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1243.76s)]
*  It does seem to me and I'm sure part of this is my own bias in my own algorithm [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1249.64s)]
*  It does seem to me that the myth of January 6th has been [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1254.72s)]
*  tremendously diminished [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1260.48s)]
*  And and part of that is the fact that the Democrats and the corporate media went so all in on it [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1262.48s)]
*  And it and it failed and this wasn't enough to remove Donald Trump [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1269.16s)]
*  but the other thing is just that I think I think the truth comes out and I think that [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1274.04s)]
*  America has had real problems over the last four years [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1281.76s)]
*  And so it's it's very hard to sell that this problem which is an imaginary one [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1284.56s)]
*  Outranked all of those other real problems and the more the truth comes out and the more footage comes out and the more [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1292.0s)]
*  Just the other problems persist for years and years [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1298.42s)]
*  It does seem to me to be so different the way people are looking back at January 6th now [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1301.94s)]
*  Compared to the way it was portrayed on that day and in the following couple of years afterward [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1308.0600000000002s)]
*  It's just you know, obviously a lot of things play a role in that the the extra footage that Tucker Carlson put out after [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1314.6200000000001s)]
*  played a big role in this [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1321.3s)]
*  But man it it's hard to not notice like what a difference four years makes where it does seem to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1323.54s)]
*  Essentially be a punchline at this point. It does seem to almost just be like a joke of [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1330.34s)]
*  Remember when that funny thing happened four years ago compared to what the media tried to make it over the last four years [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1336.3s)]
*  Well said it's like microaggressions. They're like they're [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1343.26s)]
*  Luxury good if you can start concerning yourself with microaggressions [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1346.46s)]
*  So I think you're a hundred percent right that there are enough other problems [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1349.9s)]
*  We weren't gonna pretend like this was that there's I mean [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1353.5400000000002s)]
*  It's like kind of goes back to the Charlottesville think where they were selling us that there was this racist tide and that that's [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1356.92s)]
*  The issue in the country and it's like my god who realized that we could defeat Nazis with stale urine [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1362.18s)]
*  if only they'd had that during World War two [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1367.18s)]
*  but uh [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1370.5s)]
*  Speaking of the January 6th thing and how much they were trying to sell it [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1371.8600000000001s)]
*  They were trying to create a domestic terrorism title that they were hoping to further [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1375.3799999999999s)]
*  You know apply censorship to the internet because oh my god [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1379.78s)]
*  We've got a problem with domestic terrorists and they tried to make it that Donald Trump wouldn't be able to read run for office [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1382.94s)]
*  And all of those efforts have failed and it's a while to think that just four years after that [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1389.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean probably greatest comeback ever [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1394.7s)]
*  there'll be a you know announcing there'll be a that they'll be with certifying the election results and [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1397.34s)]
*  Donald Trump will have his opportunity to pardon a lot of these political prisoners and [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1403.42s)]
*  hopefully he'll make good on that because I think they were pretty I think anyone who didn't engage in violence that day was a [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1408.02s)]
*  Definitely wrongfully prosecuted and even some of the ones that maybe did I wonder to what extent they might have been? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1414.74s)]
*  Provoked by government influences and you know people can get wrapped into the spirit of a crowd [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1421.3s)]
*  Yeah, no one 100% [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1426.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's like, you know, there's a few things there on what you just said that is all great points [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1428.34s)]
*  But so number one, I mean it really it and and Charlottesville is a great other example. I mean, I I remember [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1433.94s)]
*  when Joe Biden he he had the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1442.3s)]
*  His commercial or whatever a video where he announced that he was running for president. So this would be in [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1445.94s)]
*  2019 and [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1453.3s)]
*  He opened [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1455.8999999999999s)]
*  With Charlottesville that was his opening thing and I remember me and you just [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1458.18s)]
*  Ruthlessly mocking it because we were like, yeah, wait what your your opening thing here is [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1463.42s)]
*  Charlottesville happened and that was you're like that was two years ago, too [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1470.6200000000001s)]
*  You know like it was two years ago. It was in 2017, right? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1475.0800000000002s)]
*  I think Charlottesville happened and then the following year they came back and like no one came there were like 20 people there [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1479.9s)]
*  The when Charlottesville happened there were a couple hundred people there and then I think maybe a couple thousand counter protesters [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1485.3s)]
*  But the idea that that in any way like was a real issue that Americans cared about like it's just [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1493.3s)]
*  Just so removed from reality and in a lot of ways January 6th [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1500.7s)]
*  it was a similar type of thing where it to the [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1505.26s)]
*  To the progressive sensibilities [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1511.3799999999999s)]
*  It's almost like the worst crime imaginable that you could commit [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1515.26s)]
*  You know, the worst crime is like, you know shouting, you know [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1519.1399999999999s)]
*  White nationalist slogans or something like that and the worst crime would be like, you know [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1523.62s)]
*  breaking some windows at the Capitol building [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1529.82s)]
*  Because it's it's like people who are very, you know, frankly privileged [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1534.62s)]
*  Who have this kind of you know, sorry, I'm just remembering all this stuff [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1539.42s)]
*  But do you remember there was one point where where Andrea Mitchell? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1543.1s)]
*  Andrea Mitchell, of course, if you guys don't know her as a longtime NBC News [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1548.3s)]
*  reporter and she's she's married to Alan Greenspan who was the longtime chairman of the Federal Reserve and [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1553.1s)]
*  I remember she was talking about what [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1561.82s)]
*  when [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1564.78s)]
*  When [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1567.26s)]
*  When when Donald Trump's grab him by the pussy tape first came out and she had this clip where she was saying that she was talking [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1568.8999999999999s)]
*  To like her husband and one of her male friends and that they both told her that they were appalled and that they didn't know [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1576.66s)]
*  any men who ever spoke that way and [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1584.22s)]
*  I remember talking about it being like this is more of a comment on the men that Andrea [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1587.34s)]
*  Mitchell is around than it is on men like she was like because [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1593.98s)]
*  I'm just saying like it's frankly pretty like if there is not one job site in the United States of America that you could walk [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1599.9s)]
*  Onto and find one guy who would look you in the eyes and go I've never heard men talk about pussy before like that's just [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1607.18s)]
*  I don't know that anyone's used that turn of phrase but [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1615.3400000000001s)]
*  Because it's kind of funny and creative but yes [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1618.3s)]
*  But like it's not the idea that you've never heard anything like that in of guys talking [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1621.5s)]
*  It's just like it's ridiculous. And so there is this culture that is very removed from [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1627.46s)]
*  Working-class culture or American culture. It's a it's a culture of say like elite [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1636.12s)]
*  Low-t men, you know [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1643.0600000000002s)]
*  Like I don't know what else to say like it's it's this culture where your feelings being hurt being offended is the thing that matters [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1644.98s)]
*  The most that's not how most people live their lives and most people in fact [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1651.78s)]
*  It's only when you don't have real problems that those problems ever [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1656.9s)]
*  Get up to the top of your hierarchy of outrages. You know, you just as a point [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1663.38s)]
*  I've made many many times but you can't walk into the hood [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1668.18s)]
*  You can't walk into the hood. You can't walk into a job site. You can't walk into a trailer park [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1670.74s)]
*  You can't go to any of those places and find people who are offended by something someone said [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1675.46s)]
*  There's just too much real shit going on and that's their biggest issue not [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1682.02s)]
*  Whatever, you know what? I mean, it's not any of this and so [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1687.06s)]
*  There is something where you know the corporate media and the democrats and the progressive establishment [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1690.66s)]
*  They have failed so much on almost all meat and potatoes issues [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1697.1599999999999s)]
*  That they have nothing they can even really point to [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1702.6799999999998s)]
*  and so instead what they've attempted to do over the last few years is distract everybody and try to convince them that they should also [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1705.72s)]
*  Have these infractions at the top of their hierarchy of outrages. So like, you know, yes inflation sucks [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1714.9199999999998s)]
*  It's a problem. It's coming back down but [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1722.1999999999998s)]
*  January 6th, but like to anybody who's living on a fixed income. It's like forget about january 6th [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1725.54s)]
*  Let's talk about this. Let's talk about this problem and the other point you made. Um [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1732.2s)]
*  Was about how much they tried to do after january 6th and that really can't be overstated [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1737.56s)]
*  I mean they tried to straight up launch a domestic war on terrorism in their own words. This is what they claimed [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1743.08s)]
*  Um over january 6th, they tried to remove a presidential candidate, uh [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1750.6000000000001s)]
*  off of january 6th, uh, they there was no limit to what they were trying and again much like all of these things it was [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1756.04s)]
*  very largely based on lies [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1764.2s)]
*  Like the the original story of what came out of january 6th is just not what really happened [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1767.0s)]
*  There were a ton of lies surrounding the thing as is almost all of the case [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1773.24s)]
*  Almost always the case with these events that governments try to use in order to crack down on their citizens liberties [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1778.1200000000001s)]
*  Um, let's let's play let's go to the video of the um, it was the glenn greenwald, uh clip that or the glenn greenwald [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1785.64s)]
*  Tweet that I sent you natalie. I believe this was the first or no, I think it's the second one. I uh, I sent you today [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1792.2s)]
*  Because this was great [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1799.4s)]
*  We'll find it [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1801.5600000000002s)]
*  Officer brian sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the hours-long attack. They beat [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1803.16s)]
*  A capitol police officer to death with a fire extinguisher officer brian sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the fight [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1810.2s)]
*  He died at the age of 42 after he was bludgeoned [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1818.44s)]
*  the fire extinguisher [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1822.68s)]
*  We'll fight it [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1824.68s)]
*  Okay, so [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1826.8400000000001s)]
*  Uh, that was I guess a clip glenn greenwald had used from the old tucker carlson show on fox news [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1827.96s)]
*  So again, this was just one of the claims there were many different claims [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1833.64s)]
*  Repeated by joe biden himself that multiple police officers there died by the way this stuff [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1838.1200000000001s)]
*  They um, and and this has all come out and been widely reported. I mean, I know, um [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1843.64s)]
*  Was there a date on this? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1849.48s)]
*  Yeah, there was a an article as of april 19th [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1851.96s)]
*  of 2021 [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1857.16s)]
*  um, so this is [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1859.3200000000002s)]
*  Only a few months after january 6th [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1861.8s)]
*  Uh by npr that that ran the whole thing npr not exactly a right wing [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1865.8s)]
*  outlet that was uh, you know mentioning that the uh, the medical examiner [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1871.16s)]
*  Ruled that the cop died of natural causes on the videos now [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1876.3600000000001s)]
*  This is not the videos that were initially released but they're damn sure part of the videos that liz cheney had her hands on [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1880.04s)]
*  um [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1886.52s)]
*  He you can see after the incident where he's beaten to death [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1887.48s)]
*  with a [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1892.6000000000001s)]
*  Fire extinguisher the cop is back up and walking around [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1893.64s)]
*  He was hospitalized after the event and according to the medical examiner died of natural causes [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1897.3200000000002s)]
*  So yes, it is true. You know, like um the way, uh, um, nicole wallace there on the clip [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1902.68s)]
*  We just played she said he was beaten to death with a fire extinguisher [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1908.8400000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's a blatant lie and then it was a who was it anderson cooper who did a little bit better and said he died [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1912.2s)]
*  after [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1918.44s)]
*  Being beaten with a fire extinguisher and you're like, all right. That part is maybe a little more technically true [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1919.48s)]
*  But it's kind of like one of those died [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1926.52s)]
*  After getting covid, you know what I mean? Like yes one happened and the other happened [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1929.64s)]
*  Or at least I don't know that he was actually hit with a fire extinguisher. We saw kind of a melee, uh there but [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1934.76s)]
*  No, the two were not related and so there was a huge, uh, um [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1940.8400000000001s)]
*  You know much like with october 7th, um much like, you know with a lot of these events. It's like there's a thing [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1946.3600000000001s)]
*  Most people on its own will acknowledge that like, okay january 6. Yes, there were people who vandalized property [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1954.44s)]
*  There were people who broke in. Um, there were people who got into um, uh physical altercations with cops [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1961.8s)]
*  Like no one's denying that but then they have to lie [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1967.72s)]
*  To overplay it so much worse than what the actual thing was [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1971.24s)]
*  And then it becomes a thing where like if you question that at all now you're downplaying the event [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1975.64s)]
*  All in an effort to justify the next horrific policy that they want to push [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1981.0s)]
*  um, the the truth is and this is just [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1986.52s)]
*  beyond dispute at this point, but the only people [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1990.42s)]
*  Who died as a direct result of january 6th were trump supporters [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=1995.3200000000002s)]
*  Um, there was I think a couple who had heart issues [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2000.3600000000001s)]
*  um, and then of course there was ashley babbitt who was [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2003.96s)]
*  just [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2007.72s)]
*  gunned down unarmed [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2008.76s)]
*  Uh by a police officer who just shot into a crowd of people and hit this girl in the neck and killed her [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2011.0s)]
*  That's what happened on january 6th [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2018.28s)]
*  Anyway, any thoughts rob? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2021.4s)]
*  uh [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2025.0800000000002s)]
*  Well the ashley babbitt one now, I I agree with everything you just said [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2026.2s)]
*  I don't really fault the officer though if you don't have like [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2030.3600000000001s)]
*  Specific rulings and people are crashing through a door and you're in the capitol building. I I I get uh, I get making that bad decision [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2033.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean look I I get what you're saying [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2041.48s)]
*  At the same time you're a police officer [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2045.3200000000002s)]
*  You're supposed to be trained and one of the things that was like so like I understand I can relate to somebody panicking [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2048.12s)]
*  Um, the thing is right you'd think if you're a trained police officer and you've got a mob of people [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2055.56s)]
*  Like coming, you know [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2063.08s)]
*  in the next room [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2065.64s)]
*  To shoot one bullet into the mob of people just seems like [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2068.04s)]
*  Like what's that gonna do? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2074.44s)]
*  If they were like this crazy like group who is coming there just to kill you [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2076.76s)]
*  They're still gonna come do it. It's not like that's gonna stop it and you're just I I don't know [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2080.84s)]
*  I would think that like maybe these guys could be a little bit better trained than that [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2085.4s)]
*  But regardless, however, you feel about the ashley babbitt, uh, uh situation [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2089.08s)]
*  the the fact is that this portrayal of like [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2094.04s)]
*  What happened here was that these people broke into the building and just beat a cop to death that didn't happen [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2098.28s)]
*  And there was a look look [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2106.12s)]
*  One of the funniest things about january 6th was that years later? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2108.36s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead the whole thing just it [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2112.84s)]
*  It's the bigger government ineptitude of that. You can't half-ass things [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2116.44s)]
*  So if you actually have people storming the capitol building you bring in the capitol police you call the reinforcements like [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2121.32s)]
*  I mean i've seen movies when people are robbing a bank. That's washington dc [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2127.7999999999997s)]
*  You could have made that phone call and you could have had the army trips there [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2131.48s)]
*  So when you're leaving people in the building, they're not sure whether or not [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2134.12s)]
*  They're supposed to be securing the building or what the protocol is [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2137.0s)]
*  That's the stupidity of the situation and to what extent the fbi was involved in terms of actually opening up doors and ushering people in [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2140.12s)]
*  Um, you know what I mean? Like it's kind of all bigger picture than that single cop [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2148.04s)]
*  I'm saying being there with unclear orders guarding a door and not sure what the hell's going on [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2152.92s)]
*  I'm not really arguing with you on that. I understand the point that you're making. Um, there is [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2158.6s)]
*  What was one of the things I remember me and you laughing about was that when uh, when tucker carlson [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2163.7200000000003s)]
*  Released, um, it was right at the end of tucker's run at fox news [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2171.64s)]
*  But when he released a bunch more of the fit of footage that had never been seen before [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2175.2400000000002s)]
*  one of the things that was immediately, uh, um the [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2179.64s)]
*  The line that liz cheney and everybody else in the corporate media would use is that tucker is releasing [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2183.7200000000003s)]
*  Deceptively edited [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2190.9s)]
*  Uh portions of this or he's he's being deceptive by by cherry picking they used to claim [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2193.1600000000003s)]
*  The footage that you're allowed to see [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2199.8s)]
*  um [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2202.28s)]
*  But i'm sorry go ahead [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2203.56s)]
*  No, I was that was more flagrant than the cheap fakes thing when you were seeing actual unedited footage of biden [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2204.6s)]
*  And then they were claiming that you were engaging in the typical news thing of giving you a select clip clip out of context [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2211.4s)]
*  And so I mean what happened with tucker there should still be nationwide outrage for this the fact that this story disappeared as quickly as it did [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2218.92s)]
*  Is terrible [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2225.16s)]
*  Uh, but from what I remember the biden, uh from the tucker carlson footage is he received everything [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2226.28s)]
*  And what he put out was one episode about the shaman and we saw select clips edited clips of the shaman that made him seem [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2232.52s)]
*  I mean to me he was a goofball, but I could see what other people hey, this guy's a ringleader [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2240.2s)]
*  He's a dangerous character and he was in jail and then we saw the cops escorting him around the building [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2244.6s)]
*  Letting the guy take pictures him outside afterwards telling people trump told us to leave we have to leave [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2250.12s)]
*  And being a nice goofball and so instantly he gets led out of jail [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2255.88s)]
*  And of course they go oh it has nothing to do with the footage that you've seen [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2259.88s)]
*  It's because of other he was going to be released anyways [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2263.48s)]
*  How many other people would be out of jail if we saw all of that footage? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2267.08s)]
*  And of course they had shown us edited clips and did exactly what you were describing where they turn around and go [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2271.08s)]
*  Oh by seeing more footage than what we edited and showed you [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2276.92s)]
*  He's taking things more out of context by adding more context. He's actually showing you footage. That's more out of context [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2281.4s)]
*  Please explain that paradox of the universe to me [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2288.84s)]
*  Well, it's so it was so funny because it's like oh there as always, you know, every accusation is a confession [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2292.36s)]
*  They're always just letting you know what they did and so the truth is that [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2298.68s)]
*  on on january 6th and then [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2303.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not exaggerating [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2307.3999999999996s)]
*  Every single day after that in the corporate media [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2309.08s)]
*  They would show you [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2313.72s)]
*  the same [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2315.8799999999997s)]
*  15 video clips that we've all seen a million times and these clips involved [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2317.22s)]
*  um trump supporters breaking windows kicking down doors climbing over the [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2322.04s)]
*  Up the building and and some melees that broke out some fights that broke out between cops and trump supporters [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2328.6s)]
*  And so that's what you saw over and over and over again [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2335.3199999999997s)]
*  And then you're kind of like trained your monkey brain to be like that's what this event was [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2338.12s)]
*  What this event was was a bunch of pissed off trump supporters who by force stormed the capital assaulted police [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2343.64s)]
*  Did property damage what we then saw? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2351.0s)]
*  Uh, this is years later, right? So what we then saw with the other footage was like, oh you actually saw [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2354.7599999999998s)]
*  um [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2362.04s)]
*  Uh barricades being removed by cops [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2363.56s)]
*  Cops inviting people in welcoming people in you saw cops guiding people around [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2367.32s)]
*  While it's all going on the interactions between the people inside and the cops were all very pleasant [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2373.64s)]
*  They were thanking each other [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2379.4s)]
*  They were you know guiding each other around and you started to realize that like, okay, okay [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2380.76s)]
*  So there is you know now not one single human being and I mean this not one [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2386.1200000000003s)]
*  There is not one single human being in the world who saw [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2391.4s)]
*  Those images that tucker carlson later released but had never seen the images of the stuff in the beginning [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2396.28s)]
*  So it's not as if it didn't undo what we had already seen [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2403.8s)]
*  It just added more it just gave more context where you would go. Oh, okay [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2408.28s)]
*  So now i'm getting a clearer picture here. This was partially a violent riot and also partially [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2411.96s)]
*  Like a guided tour or something like that. It was not what the corporate media was trying to make it out to be [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2418.92s)]
*  And so that now in the case of the shaman [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2425.2400000000002s)]
*  They actually put together the clips where you can see he didn't break in [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2428.76s)]
*  He was not violent at all he's being guarded he's being walked around by cops [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2433.16s)]
*  He was let into the chamber by cops and he had very pleasant interactions with the police officers [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2439.72s)]
*  And so what you realize when you actually put all of this together is that you go like so, wait a minute [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2446.3599999999997s)]
*  So why would it be that this shaman guy became the face of january 6th? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2452.68s)]
*  Why is it that his still image was the one that the entire corporate media ran with when clearly you could see [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2458.44s)]
*  This guy at the very least was was on friendly terms with the police there and was not himself being violent [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2464.68s)]
*  And the answer is quite simple because he looked like that and he was dressed up like that [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2469.7999999999997s)]
*  And that would be the scariest image. So what the corporate media did constantly was they show you the still frame [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2475.72s)]
*  Of the shaman guy [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2482.8399999999997s)]
*  And then they'd show you the video of some fight that broke out [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2484.68s)]
*  The video of someone smashing windows and then the still frame of the shaman guy [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2488.44s)]
*  Go back and look at any of the compilations of the corporate media covering january 6th [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2493.16s)]
*  They all did that and simply because he's dressed like that. We could make you feel like this is weird and scary and threatening [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2497.56s)]
*  That's the whole game and it turns out as as you said if you've seen the guy's been in several interviews first [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2506.44s)]
*  He's not a dummy. He certainly is not a violent, uh criminal [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2512.76s)]
*  He I mean look he's he went to many hot yoga classes. Yes, you're like he's that guy [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2517.2400000000002s)]
*  He's the guy who would dress like that [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2523.0s)]
*  But the things he was talking about without he seems like a guy who's done too much [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2525.0s)]
*  ayahuasca is what it seems like a guy who was sitting there telling the cops about how they're all [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2528.58s)]
*  Lightness and good and we're all one or something like that. That's more what it is. Um, and so it's just these like [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2533.46s)]
*  Manipulation tactics were totally revealed when you got more information [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2541.38s)]
*  Um, okay, so I guess the other thing I that just it is worth pointing out about january 6th [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2550.2799999999997s)]
*  Which to me is just the most important part of of all of it is that? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2555.56s)]
*  the narrative [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2561.3199999999997s)]
*  that [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2563.16s)]
*  You know what what really happened here? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2564.68s)]
*  Okay, sorry, there's a couple things number one the other thing because we just got this confirmed, uh, very recently [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2566.9199999999996s)]
*  But then also that there were multiple at least informants [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2572.12s)]
*  at the uh at january 6 [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2576.8399999999997s)]
*  Which is something that has long been speculated about obviously the most famous one is the ray epps [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2579.16s)]
*  Uh, well, he's saying he's not actually he wasn't listed as one of the informants. That's a separate oddity [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2585.3199999999997s)]
*  it's a separate thing i'm saying in in terms of the [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2591.0s)]
*  The skepticism of january 6 the big one was this ray epps thing where you have this big burly guy [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2594.52s)]
*  Who's instructing everybody to storm the capital while the rest of the group turns on him and starts chanting fed at him? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2601.0s)]
*  because it's the most suspicious fed behavior ever and then is like [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2608.2799999999997s)]
*  um [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2613.16s)]
*  All of a sudden what at the height of demonizing everyone involved in january 6th? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2614.12s)]
*  All of the democrats took his side and started talking about what a victim he was [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2619.48s)]
*  Because the right-wing media had turned on him. It was a very bizarre [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2623.96s)]
*  Um a very bizarre chapter in all of this and then yes, you a good point of clarification [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2628.2799999999997s)]
*  Separately there were other people who were listed as fed informants who were there and it does look at the very least [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2634.18s)]
*  It's I don't want to like i'm not trying to overstate [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2639.8799999999997s)]
*  What was revealed? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2643.08s)]
*  It's not as if the government has come out and said yes there were agent provocateurs who were federal agents [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2644.44s)]
*  That's not what they're claiming, but they are admitting that there were dozens of fbi informants there [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2649.96s)]
*  And it's hard to know that and then not [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2656.28s)]
*  Have your next logical question be well, wait a minute [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2660.52s)]
*  If you're telling me this was an insurrection [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2664.6s)]
*  You're telling me this was an attempt to overthrow the democratic processes of the united states of america [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2667.7200000000003s)]
*  And you had dozens of informants there. How did you not know about this? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2673.4s)]
*  And why was there not something you know what I mean? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2678.6s)]
*  Like why wasn't this handled in a different way because of course the only way that a january 6th thing can even become what it was [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2680.84s)]
*  Let alone anything that could even remotely threaten to overthrow the united states of america's government [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2688.44s)]
*  Is if the government decides to not be prepared that day [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2694.6s)]
*  right [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2698.12s)]
*  Nobody actually believes that a force [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2699.08s)]
*  Capable of taking out the metro police [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2701.88s)]
*  existed there today forget like [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2705.8s)]
*  you know [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2708.36s)]
*  Bringing in the state troopers or or the national guard or the air force or the army or anything like that [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2709.2400000000002s)]
*  Which is obviously all a joke that any force of citizens could take them out [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2715.32s)]
*  But what force could have possibly taken out just like the dc metro police who were there? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2720.84s)]
*  No, not it was a group of unarmed people [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2726.12s)]
*  They're not taking anybody out [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2729.4s)]
*  So if you had all these informants there, how the hell did you not know about this? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2730.92s)]
*  How the hell were you not prepared? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2734.6000000000004s)]
*  There's still four years later a lot more questions than answers when it comes down to what the hell actually happened on january 6th [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2735.96s)]
*  And the questions do seem to be pointing in one direction but there was significant government involvement [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2744.2000000000003s)]
*  Um, you know look with things like this [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2750.1200000000003s)]
*  This [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2752.52s)]
*  It's always has been the achilles heel of protest movements is that all it takes is a few people [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2753.7200000000003s)]
*  Being real violent before you can make the whole thing look pretty damn violent [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2761.2400000000002s)]
*  um, and so anyway [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2764.84s)]
*  And then just the broader point being that the way it was portrayed in the media as if this was a legitimate threat [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2767.64s)]
*  To overthrow the united states of america's government or something like that has always been just [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2774.6s)]
*  Cartoonishly idiotic [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2780.74s)]
*  um any any other thoughts on uh on the [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2783.08s)]
*  The legacy of january 6th four years later rub [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2786.68s)]
*  Well on your last point it's kind of like we were joking about the spirit of the white house that they talk about it [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2790.7599999999998s)]
*  Like it's its own entity [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2795.72s)]
*  It's like if you own the capitol building [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2797.96s)]
*  Is it like capture the flag and so the government's now yours and we throw out all the rest of government [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2800.3599999999997s)]
*  And someone shows up and goes oh keeper of the capitol building, what are your instructions? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2805.6400000000003s)]
*  So we all know that they had no plan and that that's cartoonish and then uh [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2810.92s)]
*  Speaking to the fbi stuff because it's such a it's such a funny story [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2815.2400000000002s)]
*  That their best excuse now four years later is that they had 16 informants, but they just forgot to collect the information [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2820.1200000000003s)]
*  They knew it was a good idea to have informants [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2827.88s)]
*  But you know, they're not so good at their jobs to actually call them up and ask for the information [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2830.04s)]
*  They've hired them to go get uh, and then also, you know, I made this joke around your mouth [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2835.56s)]
*  It's like i've watched enough mission impossible movies that they don't give people their mission instructions to go [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2840.12s)]
*  If you're caught we'll take all accountability [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2844.68s)]
*  It's like yeah, it's like the idea that they gave these guys instructions to go [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2848.28s)]
*  Provoke the instant the insurrection and then they go after the fact. Yeah that [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2852.92s)]
*  Absolutely, he was working for us [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2857.7999999999997s)]
*  That was that was our plan all along was to try and get domestic terrorism titles that we could [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2860.04s)]
*  More police the united states and get rid of donald trump [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2865.4s)]
*  Absolutely, they were like, of course, there would be plausible deniability [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2869.06s)]
*  I mean the fact that you're confirming four years later that there were 16 people who are off the books working for the fbi [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2873.08s)]
*  Some of which were actually inside of the capitol building, of course without instructions [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2881.24s)]
*  Yeah, because you wouldn't have a paper trail of those instructions [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2885.48s)]
*  So to me the fact that they had 16 informants there on the day [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2889.56s)]
*  Who they did not collect information from to prevent it [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2892.76s)]
*  I think is about as a as about as big of a government admission as you could possibly get of yes [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2895.8s)]
*  We were involved in that. Yeah, I mean it's almost worse [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2901.64s)]
*  For them than just admitting that we orchestrated the whole thing like you really want us to believe that you're that stupid [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2905.64s)]
*  That you're like this bad at your job. Wouldn't it be better for us to just believe you're evil? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2912.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. It's very bizarre [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=2917.24s)]

*  um, okay, uh, let's let's switch gears, um, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3006.04s)]
*  and talk about because this is more on the theme of [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3009.9599999999996s)]
*  Which is a glorious theme and still will be and so we'll probably have to move on from this at some point after January 20th [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3013.24s)]
*  but not before then but on the topic of um, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3018.84s)]
*  uh post-election post mortems [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3023.0s)]
*  um, there's a clip of a [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3026.28s)]
*  Bill maher that's going super viral [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3028.84s)]
*  From his latest podcast where he had a john crier [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3031.88s)]
*  On who I guess is the uh, he's the the actor [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3036.6800000000003s)]
*  from uh, two and a half men [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3040.6800000000003s)]
*  Looks a bit different these days [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3043.48s)]
*  Um, but the two of them he's like just uh evidently [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3046.04s)]
*  Uh, like a very woke hollywood guy and it was just an interesting exchange between him and bill maher [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3050.44s)]
*  So let's let's go to that clip, uh, two and a half men guy [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3056.04s)]
*  and bill maher discussing the recent election [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3060.2s)]
*  I think the whole country [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3064.36s)]
*  even [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3066.6s)]
*  Unless you're like stupid woke. I hope you're not but you know, it is hollywood somewhat stupidly woke. Okay, uh, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3067.4s)]
*  The whole country was like I mean, I think the biggest issue for the election. One of the biggest ones was [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3075.3199999999997s)]
*  democrats pointlessly [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3081.7799999999997s)]
*  totally [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3084.2s)]
*  Just punted on immigration and let anybody who wanted to walk in for three and a half years did and [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3085.48s)]
*  You know, I think they would probably disagree the people walking in probably felt like it was a little harder [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3092.6s)]
*  No, actually actually there's a great 60 minutes piece on it where the border [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3098.44s)]
*  I mean you don't get eight million people here by making it difficult. Um, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3102.52s)]
*  But there's watch they're just I mean you see they're walking doing that water guys are just watching them [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3107.64s)]
*  uh [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3113.4s)]
*  Just already love just the level of uh of conversation on these type of podcasts. It's just so many like [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3114.3599999999997s)]
*  levels beneath the worlds that we you know dip our toes in um, but [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3122.7599999999998s)]
*  There's almost like two things being conflated here between [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3128.44s)]
*  He's going like, uh, oh they made it really easy to just walk into the country [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3132.44s)]
*  And then the actor is like well, I mean, I don't know ask one of the people who came here [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3136.52s)]
*  I don't think they would say it's very easy and there's almost like two different things that are being conflated here [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3140.92s)]
*  I don't think anybody is arguing that the journey to the southern border wasn't immensely difficult [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3146.12s)]
*  For many people who made that journey. In fact, I would argue [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3153.72s)]
*  Probably difficult for everyone [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3158.36s)]
*  There probably isn't one case of anyone walking into the united states of america where they walked up to the border and they went [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3159.88s)]
*  Man, that was the easiest journey of my life was getting from wherever I started to this point [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3167.0s)]
*  They go through like a pretty horrific, you know [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3172.6s)]
*  Path to get here. The question is more like how easy we make it at that point going forward [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3176.84s)]
*  Like that's that's really the discussion around immigration policy [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3182.92s)]
*  It doesn't really matter if you started from south africa [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3186.6800000000003s)]
*  And built your own boat and rafted over and then walked up all of south america or something like that [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3190.6000000000004s)]
*  The point is that once you reached our southern border, it was very easy to enter the country. That's kind of the point [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3196.6800000000003s)]
*  Anyway, let's continue [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3204.44s)]
*  I [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3206.92s)]
*  Will do it. They're just watching them walk past you never saw that I did not see that see that doesn't get in the liberal [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3208.2000000000003s)]
*  Media, that's the problem is the bubbles we live in [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3214.04s)]
*  I think I had it right like that kind of stuff is what lost the election for the democrats [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3217.88s)]
*  It's in all maybe part of it. I don't know. I think a lot they have polling on it. It's well [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3222.52s)]
*  I think it's inflation. I think americans hate inflation. Certainly. They hate inflation. They hate riots and they hate black women [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3227.7200000000003s)]
*  They tend they hate trans people [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3235.32s)]
*  They just spent hundreds of millions. They don't hate humanizing trans people and and that's disgusting [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3238.36s)]
*  Yeah, we shouldn't talk politics. Okay, you shouldn't I mean great. I don't I we don't have to [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3244.76s)]
*  All right, so it's uh, it's always I don't know why it's always fun for me to see like uh, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3252.6s)]
*  like [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3260.04s)]
*  There's this dynamic with hollywood leftist types where um, and and it's true in general with like [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3261.48s)]
*  with former leftists [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3268.92s)]
*  Let's say um, and at this point I think is a huge part of the trump coalition to be honest, but it's always like [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3271.96s)]
*  They're with the craziness until the craziness hits a point. That's too crazy for them [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3279.8s)]
*  And then they go, okay, that's that's my line, you know [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3285.72s)]
*  Um, but it's always funny to see them like outflanked to the left where he's like look i'm trying to be a leftist, too [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3289.48s)]
*  But like I just I can't be this retarded [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3297.32s)]
*  So we have to do something and so I just find this funny to be like [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3300.44s)]
*  a little representation of like because I do wonder to myself sometimes like what is [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3303.72s)]
*  You know rob we've seen a lot right? There's almost been this um [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3308.52s)]
*  this uh [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3313.24s)]
*  Separating of what is it the wheat and the chaff? How do I say that correctly? Uh the you know [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3314.66s)]
*  You cut the grass and the snake show or whatever. So there are almost like bath waters [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3321.14s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. Uh, so there's almost like these two different camps that you could see right? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3327.46s)]
*  and [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3332.8199999999997s)]
*  There are the there's the camp of say like democrats who want to throw out the woke stuff [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3333.62s)]
*  after the defeat of uh [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3340.1s)]
*  Of kamala harris, they're like we got to get rid of all this woke insanity. It's turning people off [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3342.18s)]
*  Um now as we've said many times on the show. I find this to be a very shallow surface level [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3347.38s)]
*  Analysis of what happened in this election, but [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3353.12s)]
*  They at least acknowledge that and then there's the people over here who are like the true believers [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3356.02s)]
*  And they're like, what do you mean throw off the woke stuff? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3361.38s)]
*  I'm all about woke stuff. You know, like i'm not I believe in this. I thought we all believed in this and there is [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3364.02s)]
*  As bizarre as it is look obviously [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3370.66s)]
*  The person who's like hey, we should throw off the woke stuff is clearly much more tethered to reality and frankly [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3373.54s)]
*  More sane than the people saying no, we should double down on it [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3381.7799999999997s)]
*  I must admit though. There's something I respect about the true believer [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3386.5s)]
*  Like it's just all right. Wait, hold on a second. There's [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3390.5s)]
*  Well, no i'm not even saying this guy i'm just saying more generally before we get into this guy [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3395.22s)]
*  Just like more generally there's something about the person who's like wait [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3399.46s)]
*  I thought we all really believed in this stuff over the last year that you like [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3404.26s)]
*  AOC will take the pronouns out of her twitter bio like that. It's like well, we're not doing that anymore [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3407.94s)]
*  That's not the path to power. Okay, what's the path to power you tell me and we'll go pursue that path [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3412.7400000000002s)]
*  But then there's other people who are like what are the but that's transphobic [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3417.2200000000003s)]
*  You're transphobic now aoc i'm just saying at least those people believed in what they said not applying that to this guy specifically [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3421.78s)]
*  This stupid queef is a male feminist type guy. He's found the weakest path to a personality [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3428.98s)]
*  Which is hey if I take this banner does that instantly make me the nicest person in the room? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3435.3s)]
*  And so that was granted to him let him keep his job and now he'll go anywhere and preach how you're just not being kind [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3440.82s)]
*  Because you don't share this lame [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3448.26s)]
*  Perspective which by the way isn't kind you're talking about kids that will have be forcefully mutilated [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3450.8s)]
*  And figure out later in life that that didn't help treat their depression or autism [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3457.72s)]
*  Or that they were just going to grow out of it [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3461.96s)]
*  Anyway, so it's just it's this liberal thing that as long as you're into whatever [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3463.7999999999997s)]
*  You know is the most advanced degree of socialism then you're on the side of niceness and being in front inside these [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3469.3199999999997s)]
*  Reinforcing circles that just agree with you. Hey government free health care to everyone [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3476.18s)]
*  So anyways, i've been trying like especially p covid. I mean not p covid even p covid [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3480.44s)]
*  Yeah, because that was like people who bought into it the amount of comedians that had this personality for a stretch of life [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3485.24s)]
*  Where it was just safest to be on the side of the regime [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3491.56s)]
*  So if you're not keeping covid it's because you're an idiot and you don't care about grandma or at the chief of hey [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3495.08s)]
*  You can't use not nice words. I remember some of these personalities at the creek in the cave and oh, I remember [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3500.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, I remember it. Well rob. Oh, yeah, it's brutal dude, and it's the especially as a comedian [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3506.9199999999996s)]
*  It's just particularly disgusts me because you're like it's it's the antithesis of funny [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3512.04s)]
*  but [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3518.2s)]
*  Or and also just being a man, whatever but I love that the guy goes [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3519.4s)]
*  He goes well, I think a lot of people just really don't like inflation [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3524.44s)]
*  And then he goes and riots [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3529.4s)]
*  And then he says and black women [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3532.36s)]
*  And then he says and trans people [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3535.24s)]
*  Which is it already first of all? Um [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3538.04s)]
*  Just to pick this apart a little bit here number one [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3542.52s)]
*  It's it's insulting to inflation [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3547.64s)]
*  It's insulting to inflation [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3552.2s)]
*  To to put it in this list as if it's just one of these things that people arbitrarily don't like [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3555.08s)]
*  Much like it's kind of a like like the same way they're bigoted against black women and trans people [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3562.12s)]
*  They also don't like inflation [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3567.72s)]
*  It's like what again talk about a privileged way of looking at the world like inflation is oh, you know [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3569.8s)]
*  You're you and your family's dreams falling further from your grasp that a silly little thing like that [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3576.84s)]
*  um [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3583.32s)]
*  Number two the riot what riots? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3584.2s)]
*  What's he talking about? He's talking about in the summer of 2020 when donald trump went on to lose the election [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3587.2400000000002s)]
*  Also, by the way, who likes riots? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3594.28s)]

*  Anyway, okay. Who who's like on the side of a riot? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3601.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes, obviously they're bad. Yes [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3605.16s)]
*  Killing, you know dozens of people and assaulting hundreds of people and causing billions of dollars in property damage and terrorizing [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3607.56s)]
*  People who are just trying to run a business is bad. That's not good [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3615.72s)]
*  um [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3620.28s)]
*  But then look, I mean this stuff at the end about [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3621.4s)]
*  Oh my god, I've been dealing with this on on [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3623.96s)]
*  uh twitter [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3627.8s)]
*  Recently because there's so many people, you know whining at me to condemn anti-semitism [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3629.32s)]
*  Why won't you condemn it dave and you know, it's just all of this stuff about like look the real problem here [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3634.2s)]
*  That progressives have and they've had this for quite a while now [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3641.4s)]
*  Is and it's an unfortunate thing. It's it's bizarre [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3645.8s)]
*  It's bizarre you remember at the beginning of covet rob [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3649.24s)]
*  We used to talk about this a lot how bizarre it was that people would get a would get pissed off when you gave them good news [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3652.6s)]
*  Because people were so attached to like the the catastrophe of covet that if you went like oh, hey [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3660.04s)]
*  Look the all these new studies coming out indicate that the death rate is like a fraction of what they originally [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3666.6s)]
*  Guess the death rate might be and they'd get pissed off and you'd be like wait we [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3672.2799999999997s)]
*  We should all be together that it's good [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3676.6s)]
*  That the death rate's lower than we thought it might be right. That's good news [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3679.24s)]
*  You want to live a life, right? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3683.64s)]
*  Like what and it almost seemed like at certain point people didn't want to and in the same thing [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3685.96s)]
*  It's a real problem progressives have had and it has led it has been so damaging [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3690.52s)]
*  To a generation of young people who who were brought up in this woke garbage [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3695.4s)]
*  the real problem they have is that [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3700.6s)]
*  the the racism in this country just [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3702.92s)]
*  Does not meet your demand for it like the supply just isn't there [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3707.48s)]
*  But I know you want it you have all this demand for like a racist country. It's just unfortunately the supply isn't there [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3712.36s)]
*  We're just not that racist of a country. We're actually even today even after kind of the back [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3719.48s)]
*  tracking of race relations [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3726.42s)]
*  Mostly due to woke progressives over the last decade. We're still a remarkably not racist country [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3728.92s)]
*  That's the truth. Okay, the the truth is that if you go almost almost anywhere else in the world [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3736.6s)]
*  and you see the amount of kind of uh racial divides tribal divides sectarian divides they [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3743.08s)]
*  Dwarf the united states of america go go not that far from the usa go to go to the dominican republic and [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3749.38s)]
*  Take a look at the prejudice between light-skinned dominicans and dark-skinned dominicans. It is [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3756.84s)]
*  You've never seen anything like it in your life in the united states of america and [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3762.68s)]
*  Again, like so this idea that that like the trump voters are so motivated by their hatred of black women [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3767.64s)]
*  Just isn't true at all and on the trans stuff [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3772.7599999999998s)]
*  I know we've said this a million times but the fact of the matter is and this is the truth [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3775.16s)]
*  If they had never brought it to kids [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3781.16s)]
*  There never would have been enough backlash [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3784.12s)]
*  to even register [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3787.3999999999996s)]
*  And none of these commercials that trump ran would have ever been run, you know [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3789.8s)]
*  It's if it was just look most people [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3793.7200000000003s)]
*  Let me say this [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3797.32s)]
*  All people who are not mentally ill [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3798.84s)]
*  Know that there is a biological difference between men and women 100% of people nobody genuinely believes [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3803.1600000000003s)]
*  You can go from being a girl to becoming a boy [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3810.2000000000003s)]
*  No one actually believes that except some mentally ill people [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3813.1600000000003s)]
*  Any more than people believe you can go from being a boy to being a tree it just can't happen [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3816.3599999999997s)]
*  We you can live [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3821.56s)]
*  as a [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3823.7999999999997s)]
*  Girl in a sense like you can you can dress up like a girl and call yourself a girl and ask other people to [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3824.7599999999998s)]
*  Refer to you as she and her and lots of people are willing to do that. Lots of people are willing [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3830.68s)]
*  To not be a dick [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3836.3599999999997s)]
*  Now there are some other right wingers out there who maybe would never do that and wouldn't call you by your pronouns, but [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3838.04s)]
*  That's about it [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3843.72s)]
*  That's about as much political backlash as you were going to get if it was just adults doing what they wanted to do with their [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3844.7599999999998s)]
*  With their body the issue became when you started aggressively pushing it on children and then taking steps to transition children [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3850.2s)]
*  That's what the issue is and so again, they don't ever want to say that and actually defend that so the the answer is just like [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3858.44s)]
*  Well, why were they running these ads against trans people? Oh because they hate trans people or something like that [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3864.44s)]
*  It's like no, no, no, no, it's because they wanted to protect children [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3868.7599999999998s)]
*  Now if you want to take on that and you want to actually have that argument fine have it [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3872.2s)]
*  But that's what the whole thing was about [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3876.2799999999997s)]
*  None of those other knots. It's not just like oh americans just subjectively are so bigoted that they hate black women and trans people [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3878.68s)]
*  And riots and inflation [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3885.56s)]
*  It was quite a list. All right. Listen, we got to wrap up the show there [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3888.2799999999997s)]
*  Thank you guys so much for uh for listening. We'll catch you with a brand new episode tomorrow. Peace [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PGM9psPKuc&t=3890.8399999999997s)]
