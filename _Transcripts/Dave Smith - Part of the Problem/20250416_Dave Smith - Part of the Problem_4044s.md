*  Xanys and Rosemont, which is like just outside of Chicago. So come on out. There's still a few [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=28.96s)]

*  that's been going on in the world and everything that's been going on with me, it seemed like the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=39.84s)]
*  perfect time to have the great Scott Horton on the show. There's really never a bad time to have [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=43.92s)]
*  Scott Horton on the show, but this seemed like a particularly good one. Scott is the, the founder [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=48.64s)]
*  and the director of the libertarian Institute. He's for many years been the managing editor over [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=54.88s)]
*  at antiwar.com. And of course he is the author of three of the best, if not the best books written [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=59.92s)]
*  about us foreign policy over the last 30 ish years. Uh, fools errands was the phenomenal book about [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=67.36s)]
*  the war in Afghanistan. Enough already is the best book that's ever been written on the terror [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  wars. And of course his newest, uh, his newest masterpiece is provoked, which is really the entire [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=78.39999999999999s)]
*  history of, from the collapse of the Soviet union through the start of the war in Ukraine. Uh, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  Scott, how are you buddy? Good to see you again. Thank you. Uh, very happy to be here, Dave. And [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=91.6s)]
*  it's actually goes all the way through the entire war in Ukraine through it's current up to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  publication day in November of 24 there, but yeah, thanks very much. And by the way, it's, um, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  five months today and this whole time, number one in war and peace on amazon.com after five months [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=108.08s)]
*  accepting a couple of weeks there were Jimmy Carter died and Dave Chappelle talked about his [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=114.56s)]
*  book peace, not apartheid on Saturday night live, which I don't mind because it's a good book [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=117.68s)]
*  from what I've read from what I've read of the accusations against him for writing it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  But also congratulations to you on being the center of attention of the entire internet this [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  week. Boy, are you the rocks that Douglas Murray broke neoconservatism on? That was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=132.24s)]
*  beautiful to behold. And then also, before we really get started, did you see my awesome, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=138.24s)]
*  huge hilarious comedy jokes? I opened for Robbie the fire Bernstein at the Iowa libertarian party [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=144.0s)]
*  state convention and I killed in that room. I will have you know, did you see it? I do. I, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=150.72s)]
*  I apologize to you, my dear friend. I have not gotten a chance to watch it yet. I will watch it [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  today. I'm very, I always start with a Dave joke. I know you do. For you bastard. Well, yeah, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=160.48s)]
*  listen, that is it is really incredible. How successful the book has been, particularly [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  because it is, it's a big book and it's a, a dense read. And that's the toughest thing to get people [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=174.0s)]
*  to read. You know, it's not like you wrote a romance novel or something. I mean, this is, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=181.92s)]
*  it's challenging work and it's, it really is a testament to how good the book is and how valuable [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  the information is. I also, I think that was probably the best way I've heard anyone describe [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=190.8s)]
*  the Douglas Murray debate. Me just being the rock that he broke neoconservatism on. Well, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  it's been, it's been interesting. And it is, you know, you, me and you were talking on the phone [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=202.16s)]
*  last night and you were telling me about the, the poll, which I did after we spoke, I went and looked [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=208.16s)]
*  up, but it is interesting, the polling on support for Israel and particularly amongst the young [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=213.84s)]
*  generation, how it's kind of, in a sense, letting us know what we all kind of knew, but that this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=219.84s)]
*  is just, it is, you can't overstate how profound the gap is between the way our parents generation [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=226.72s)]
*  viewed Israel and the way moving forward, Israel will be viewed. It's just, you know, like this, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=236.0s)]
*  this war really did change all of that. And so it's a very interesting, very interesting time [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=241.6s)]
*  to be in the middle of all this action. Yeah. You know, I always thought that Israel, like their [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=246.72s)]
*  foreign policy, and I guess, right, the, the, um, the Austrians would explain that all governments [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=252.72s)]
*  are like this and the more democratic, right? Like Hoppe says, the, the quicker the time, uh, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=257.36s)]
*  the turnover rate in the people in power, the shorter their time preference, but it seems like [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=262.08s)]
*  Israel, even with long serving Benjamin Netanyahu, it seems like they always have the highest type [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=267.04s)]
*  of a time preference, right? Or like, for example, they'll say, we need you to attack Iran for us [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=271.52s)]
*  because we think that's in our interest where they're not looking at what are the American [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=276.96s)]
*  people going to think and how are they going to feel about Israel? Lying them into another war, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  another major war in the middle East that's for Israel's interests and absolutely against [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=285.2s)]
*  America's interests. And how do you expect that to play out over the next few decades [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  when their little nation state is wholly dependent on ours? Don't they care if we hate them or not? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=294.4s)]
*  I mean, I still got a chip on my shoulder over them lying us into a rock war too. And of course, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=300.08s)]
*  it was the Israel lobby led by the neoconservatives that pushed for Obama's dirty war in Syria 10 [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=304.16s)]
*  years ago. Now they got us fighting again more on the side of Al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=308.88s)]
*  against the Houthis in Yemen, the guys that tried to blow up the plane over Detroit on Christmas day, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=313.76s)]
*  2009. And I mean, how you got Jolani and Al Qaeda now taken over Syria. I don't think any of this [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=317.92s)]
*  is in America's interest, Dave. And it seems like, you know, and then what's their answer [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=326.08s)]
*  to call me a vicious anti-Semite and try to censor me. Right? You can't say that. You're not allowed [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=332.0s)]
*  to talk about that. You know, I read one this morning about there's a lady, you have young kids, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=337.52s)]
*  you might know her. Her name's miss Rachel. And she, yeah, I do know who she is. Yeah. Yeah. So [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=342.88s)]
*  she plays around muppets and stuff and does like childhood education type things, you know, learning [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=348.56s)]
*  how to count to 10 and this kind of deal. And, but she did a little thing about how she feels bad [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=352.88s)]
*  for the people of the Gaza strip and the stop anti-Semitism account on Twitter said, come on, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=357.04s)]
*  everybody, let's all mass report her to the department of justice for representing, for [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=362.4s)]
*  being an unregistered agent of a foreign power. And let's try to get the FBI to open an investigation [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=366.88s)]
*  on miss Rachel. And I'm saying, listen, you know, I think that might do you more harm than good [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  acting that way against your greatest benefactors, the people of the United States of America. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=379.92s)]
*  And you just were getting to the point where they, this claim that there's no daylight between our [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  interests and their interests just could not be more absurd. There's nothing more important to [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=391.68s)]
*  our society than for example, preserving our first amendment and everyone who threatens it better back [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=397.36s)]
*  off. And that includes nasty little nation states that don't do us any good that, that, that balance [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=404.56s)]
*  their side of the ledger in, in no way to our benefit, you know, they're all cost and no gain. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=412.88s)]
*  And I could see why they hate us because dependence breeds resentment, but resentment breeds resentment [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  right back then too, you know, people don't like having their chain jerked all the time. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=425.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's, it's such a, by the way, my kids both did watch miss Rachel a little bit. It's a, it's, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=430.32000000000005s)]
*  it's a really good show for like babies. Like TV isn't really good for like one and two year olds, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=436.88s)]
*  but if you're going to watch something, miss Rachel was like the best thing to watch. It's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=443.04s)]
*  purely educational and it's actually based on like, like speech therapy. So it does a lot of these [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  things where like she points to her mouth and pronounces words and very good. Now I stopped [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  watching it with my kids because she's a little too lefty for me. And like, there's like a trans [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=456.64s)]
*  person in the show and they, she kind of like made a thing out of that. And I'm like, yeah, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=461.52s)]
*  I don't really know if my two year old needs to be introduced to this yet, but it is wild [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=466.32s)]
*  that this is their objection to her, that she had, and again, it is at least, at least how it started [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=470.96s)]
*  with Candace Owens was a very similar thing. She just, her crime was just having some humanity [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=476.96s)]
*  for the babies who are dying by having their bones crushed under rubble while they cry out [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=484.0s)]
*  for their moms and no one comes to save them. It's really just remarkable. And you know, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=489.84s)]
*  the other thing you mentioned there that, so I was on Breaking Points yesterday with a Sagar and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=493.76s)]
*  Crystal Ball. I love both of them, love that show. And so I was on there and I was making the point [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=500.16s)]
*  as we got into like the stuff with attacking the Houthis and the calls for war with Iran. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=505.68s)]
*  And the thing that, you know, I said that kind of stuck out to me was like, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=512.0s)]
*  they, there's not even any propaganda anymore with these wars. Like it's not even like, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=516.72s)]
*  you're not even handing the American people like, you know, Saddam Hussein has these nuclear weapons [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  and he was in on planning 9-11 and he's going to pass these nukes off to the terrorists and then [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  they're going to nuke Kansas or whatever exactly, you know, like the 2002 propaganda was. Nobody's [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=531.28s)]
*  even saying that. Like nobody's even claiming that like there's any conceivable way in which [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=536.4s)]
*  the Houthis are going to attack the United States of America. Cause I mean, it's just too ridiculous [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=541.84s)]
*  to even claim that. I guess even for them, it's too ridiculous. And nobody's like seriously [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=546.24s)]
*  claiming that Iran is on the verge of attacking America. It's more like, obviously all of these [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  wars were on behalf of Israel, but it's just more blatant. Like it doesn't even seem like there's a [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  propaganda apparatus to try to persuade you that this is actually in America's interest. And then, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=565.52s)]
*  you know, to, to your point there, and this is something I probably should have done a better [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=571.04s)]
*  job of articulating in the debate with Douglas Murray, but you know, when he says to me, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=575.28s)]
*  Oh, you can't mention Paul Wolfowitz because you know, you, you'll be concerned with what [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=580.88s)]
*  festers up underneath there or something like that. It's like, okay, even if that is the number one [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=585.92s)]
*  concern, which I don't think should be the number one concern when children are being slaughtered, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=592.4s)]
*  but okay. If the concern is we don't want to see a rise in Jew hatred, it's like, well, what do you [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=597.04s)]
*  think getting in another war blatantly for Israel is going to result in? What do you think telling [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=602.48s)]
*  people they're not allowed to talk about Paul Wolfowitz is going to result in? And I feel like [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=608.24s)]
*  this is something it's like the old Ron Paul Giuliani moment. It's a through line through all [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=612.56s)]
*  of your work where it's just seems so, you know, short-sighted high time preference, if you will, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=617.76s)]
*  for people to not realize that these actually, if that is your concern to not see a rise in, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=623.36s)]
*  in Jew hatred, well, geez, we've seen a big spike in it over the last 18 months. I wonder what could [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=628.4s)]
*  account for that. And what do you think is going to be the result of this next war? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=634.56s)]
*  Yeah, seriously. Hasbara isn't going to do it. Oh, wait, hold that thought, Dave. Let me just spin [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=639.28s)]
*  you real quick and just tell you why it's okay. And we got no choice and you got to believe it's [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=644.4s)]
*  just not going to work. Okay, fine. Then you hate Jews then Dave, that's not going to work either. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  It's already not working. And I guess for some people they say, okay, fine, I guess I do or that [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=654.64s)]
*  kind of thing, which is a huge mistake. But overall, that doesn't play. I mean, the United [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  States of America, there's no organized political force of anti-Semitism anywhere. Give me a break. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  And leftist, maybe even the ones who are the most extreme toward the, you know, in favor of the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=671.5999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians, they're still civil rightsy type people, right? So they're not, you know, if they [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  pick on Jews, it's because of their whiteness, not because of their Jewishness. You know what I mean? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=683.28s)]
*  So like, it just doesn't stick these false accusations. You know what I mean? When, when, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=688.88s)]
*  when, as everyone watching this knows, including the people I'm referring to, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=694.56s)]
*  anyone who actually hates Jews on the internet will tell you that that's exactly what they want. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=701.52s)]
*  That's exactly what, how they feel and how they want you to feel too. And so like, have you ever [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=706.88s)]
*  encountered like a secret anti-Semite who like pretended he wasn't for a long time and then [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=712.64s)]
*  finally he admitted it or something? Like, I don't know of anybody like that. You know what I mean? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=716.56s)]
*  People, and when you're a libertarian, that makes you an individualist. And so that makes you immune [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=720.64s)]
*  from any kind of collectivist hatred of anybody anyway. So that's one of the major benefits of [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=726.16s)]
*  libertarianism, right? Is you make sure never to put your cart before your horse or any of that [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=731.52s)]
*  kind of stuff. Yeah, no, that's, that's exactly right. And it does like, you know, again, there's [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=736.72s)]
*  a weird thing where, you know, it's not as if like in, in a vacuum, there is some, if I'm being [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=743.84s)]
*  charitable, like there's something to the point that Douglas Murray was making about how like, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=751.76s)]
*  okay, now that the expert class has been discredited, you have all this kind of completely [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=757.36s)]
*  decentralized world of, you know, you know, people and, and putting ideas out there and they could be [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=763.6800000000001s)]
*  turning over rocks that either are like, ah, that's probably a dangerous one to overturn, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=771.76s)]
*  or they could be overturning something which me and you talk about, you know, I mean, privately, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=776.8s)]
*  we've talked about this before, where people are just going down conspiracy rabbit holes, and you're [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=781.04s)]
*  kind of rolling your eyes at them like, guys, you just have not done your due diligence on this. And [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=784.9599999999999s)]
*  so like, it's not that there's nothing to that. It's just that we don't live in a vacuum. Like, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=789.3599999999999s)]
*  we live in the world that we live in. And in this, it is interesting to me. And I think this is like [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=794.56s)]
*  a useful framework to almost view these things through is that just going without jumping to [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=799.92s)]
*  wild conspiracies, just the conspiracies we know about, okay, we were lied into war after war after [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=805.28s)]
*  war, for 20 plus years. I mean, every single one of them just like every Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=813.1999999999999s)]
*  Syria, I mean, Somalia, I guess they didn't really even bother lying to us about they just did it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=820.4799999999999s)]
*  There were some lies in there, you cover it in enough already. But like there was [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  a certain certainly in Yemen, there were lies that were told. So all of these wars, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=829.28s)]
*  they're sold off lies. At the same time, we all know, I think even Douglas Murray would have [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=835.92s)]
*  conceded this had I brought it up, that the intelligence agencies framed the sitting president [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=840.56s)]
*  of the United States of America for treason for being a Russian spy in his last term. Oh, and also, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=845.68s)]
*  what was uncovered is there's a giant pedophile ring. We still can't know the truth about it, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=851.1199999999999s)]
*  because it must be redacted for national security purposes. So like whatever your conspiracy there [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=855.68s)]
*  is, there is a pedophile ring that involved the top levels of American political and cultural, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=861.92s)]
*  you know, figures that was very clearly connected to intelligence, and not just our intelligence [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=867.92s)]
*  agencies. So like knowing all of that, in that moment, if all you have to say is to counter signal, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=875.12s)]
*  you know, like where the people have gone too far in pointing out conspiracies, that you're doing [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=882.88s)]
*  that in service of something like you're you're in service of the regime. Now. All right, guys, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=888.8s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is paint your life. Mothers [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=893.52s)]

*  your favorite memory from a family vacation. You could put a lost loved one into a moment that you [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=920.8s)]

*  the show. Yeah, you know, Greenwald, the great Glenn Greenwald, he would always pick on these guys [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=979.12s)]
*  from the NBC truth squad, where they would go and debunk like the lowest level, no one cares, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=983.84s)]
*  conspiracy theory, trash out on the internet. Like, oh my God, setting the record straight about this [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  thing that nobody even believes that nobody cares. Certainly nobody with any power influence or you [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=993.92s)]
*  know what I mean? Like not even not even debunking QAnon, but like debunking stuff that nobody's [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=998.4799999999999s)]
*  even paying attention to. Meanwhile, caring water for the establishment that's lying about everything [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1003.68s)]
*  you left off, I know your favorite, which is the US government paying for somebody to cook up this [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1008.8s)]
*  germ in a Chinese lab that then got leaked and killed millions of people and led to all these [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1013.8399999999999s)]
*  totalitarian measures and all of this stuff. And they absolutely lied about that censored everyone [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1019.12s)]
*  who wanted to talk about how it happened and all this stuff the whole time. And then, but then as [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1024.16s)]
*  far as, you know, anti-Semitism and racism and conspiracy, like quackery wealth, all that happens [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1029.52s)]
*  is people turn like 24 and then they grow up a bit. You know what I mean? Like, give me a break, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1037.76s)]
*  dude. The whole world, this country is lousy with former racists and former kooks. I was a new world [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  order, one world government cook, like in the mold of John Birch and all that stuff, not the literal [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1050.4799999999998s)]
*  John Birch, but the John Birch Society stuff, New American Magazine circa 1990s. And it turned out [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1055.12s)]
*  that wasn't right. And then like turn 24. And I was like, oh yeah, I guess, you know, I was probably [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1061.52s)]
*  jumping to some conclusions there and this kind of thing. And you know, there are plenty of people [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1068.1599999999999s)]
*  who got into politics because of space aliens or because of, you know, loose change, 9-11 [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1072.64s)]
*  crankery or whatever it is. And then they ended up being good on all kinds of stuff anyway. So, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1080.24s)]
*  you know, I'm not too prejudiced against people being wrong. That was why, you know, I went on, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1085.44s)]
*  no offense, your friend, Noam Dwarman's podcast thing there. And yeah, you have to take [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1090.88s)]
*  responsibility for that for some reason. I'm not sure. That doesn't seem to make sense. Disavow him, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1097.5200000000002s)]
*  Dave. Disavow. And that was his whole thing. It was like, what do you mean that your job is [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1101.84s)]
*  denouncing every other person in alternative media who doesn't agree with you? Like, geez, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1107.04s)]
*  that's because my job is denouncing everybody in government who doesn't agree with me and actually [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1112.6399999999999s)]
*  has power and influence and does things to people with tax dollars and guns and all of this stuff. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1116.8s)]
*  You really think it's my job to police all the alternative media websites, not to interview the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1124.0s)]
*  guy that wrote the best article on their site, but the guy that wrote the worst article on their [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1129.52s)]
*  site. That's so many of you like this. Maybe call a Abbey Martin's little brother, the hall monitor, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1135.76s)]
*  and he'll go and take care of that for you, dude. But I don't care about that. Give me a break. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1142.0s)]
*  Well, you know what? Here's the example almost I would use of this and see if you think this fits, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1146.96s)]
*  but it reminds me of like, when the pro Israeli guys will be saying, they'll go, well, look at [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1151.36s)]
*  Hamas's genocidal intent. I mean, they did October 7th and then they said they want to do a thousand [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1159.36s)]
*  more of them. And you're like, okay, cool. Like we could deal with the fact that Hamas wants the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1165.4399999999998s)]
*  destruction of Israel right after we get to the fact that Israel is currently destroying Gaza. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1170.8s)]
*  Like if we could just do that one first, because you get why I'd prioritize the one that's [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1176.56s)]
*  actually happening. But it reminds me of, you know, when the Democrats, and they were saying [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1180.4799999999998s)]
*  this last year, Scott, if you, you know, pay attention to any of the mainstream media, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1185.28s)]
*  which I know you're too smart for, I shouldn't call it the mainstream media, whatever it is, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1189.36s)]
*  the old guy, the old, yes, the former mainstream media, but all the Democrats and all of their, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1193.04s)]
*  their corporate shills in the media, their talking point was if Trump gets in, he might weaponize [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1198.8s)]
*  the justice system. And you could immediately like every Trump supporter immediately goes like, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1203.76s)]
*  why look, even if there is the possible concern that he could do that, why does that not [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1209.04s)]
*  resonate? Because you're doing it right now. And so first we're going to talk about that. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1214.88s)]
*  Like you don't get to talk about this other stuff until we first address the fact that you're doing [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1220.64s)]
*  the thing. So like, I'm sorry, you know, like there's just no way that you're going to, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1225.2800000000002s)]
*  you're going to convince me that I should prioritize calling out powerless people with, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1231.44s)]
*  you know, who often do have some goofy conspiracies, by the way, often have some [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1238.48s)]
*  good conspiracies that are correct. But like, no, I'm not prioritizing that while all of these [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1242.0s)]
*  people who are still in power are destroying the world. Sorry. Seriously. And by the way, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1248.0s)]
*  just speaking of that example too is I saw it was at the attorney general or the governor, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1252.8s)]
*  I think it was the attorney general of New York is now being investigated by the justice department. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1257.84s)]
*  And she's the one who had trumped up these charges against Trump. And I'm like, I hope they give her [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1262.8s)]
*  life. I don't even care. I, you know what? And I'm not even a Trump guy, but I so resent Joe Biden [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1266.72s)]
*  and the, and every single lawyer at justice who went along with plans to persecute and prosecute [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1274.08s)]
*  Donald Trump to try to prevent him from running for president again. And I told you before, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1279.3600000000001s)]
*  this is as close as I ever got to vote for Trump was when Jack Smith filed new charges in the [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1283.44s)]
*  middle of October last year. I'm just like, again, this is not my Ron Paul. Okay. This is [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1287.6000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump. He's not my guy. I'm not in his corner, but man, that is so absolutely, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1293.76s)]
*  unbelievably outrageous and just criminal, regardless of exactly what the law says, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1300.4s)]
*  says criminal in the most basic sense that they would even think of where is even their [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1305.76s)]
*  head at to think that they could get away with that. Now I bet you they improved his margin [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1310.08s)]
*  of victory by at least two or three points because of their attempted again, cheating against him and [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1315.76s)]
*  lawfare against him in this way, just as much as they made him that much more deterred. I mean, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1322.64s)]
*  pardon me, determined when they raided his place in down there in Florida, where he was like, oh, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1328.0800000000002s)]
*  that's it. I'm coming back. There's no way you're going to stop me now. You know what I mean? So [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1335.0400000000002s)]
*  like a lot of their interventions, it's all blowback and it never accomplishes their goals. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1340.96s)]
*  You know? Yeah, no, that's absolutely right. And I mean, you made the point about Israel. I think [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1346.0s)]
*  it also applies to the American regime. And when I say that, I mean, with Donald Trump being [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1351.4399999999998s)]
*  slightly outside of that, but still, I'm not referring just to the presidency, but to the kind [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1359.84s)]
*  of permanent government and the establishments of both the Democratic and Republican parties, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1366.8s)]
*  that it does, it's one of the scariest dynamics. We've talked about this a lot over the years, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1371.6s)]
*  but it does seem like it's not just that like they're the ruling class and they're corrupt. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1376.48s)]
*  It's just like, man, they are so short sighted. It feels almost like the boat's going down and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1381.76s)]
*  they're like, well, let's loot all the treasure we can before this thing sinks. But like, again, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1387.52s)]
*  to your point that Israel would not even like think to themselves like, well, actually, okay, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1392.72s)]
*  look, let's say whatever it is, we want to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip. Perhaps, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1398.96s)]
*  we want to ultimately, I think the major goal is they really want the West Bank. And so, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1405.6000000000001s)]
*  whatever, maybe they think this can help in that, but they're not going to go. But man, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1410.96s)]
*  in the age of cell phones, for us to just be slaughtering poor people like this, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1415.04s)]
*  really might turn a huge percentage of the population against us. Like, does that never [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1422.16s)]
*  even register? And it's wild that it seemingly doesn't. I mean, I shouldn't say that because [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1427.52s)]
*  to be completely fair, there are voices inside Israel that are making these points, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1434.8s)]
*  but they never seem to win the day. Well, I mean, Netanyahu came to the United States to meet with [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1439.76s)]
*  Tim Pool and I was really disappointed to see him and Mariel Hemingway from the Federalist, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1444.32s)]
*  who I really respect. She did a lot of really great stuff on Russiagate. And I really liked her. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1451.6799999999998s)]
*  Everybody else, there was a bunch of Dave Rubens, but you can see they are very worried. They're [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1457.76s)]
*  trying to collect all the Dave Rubens and give them their marching orders. Just like you mentioned [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1462.56s)]
*  Wolfowitz, for people, if you're sick of W. Bush and Paul Wolfowitz, well, here's Donald Trump [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1469.2s)]
*  and Elliott Abrams, which Abrams was in the Bush years too. But you know what I mean? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1478.48s)]
*  We're like, they go, Donald Trump, he's two clicks to the right. He's a nationalist. He's not like [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1483.44s)]
*  that squishy W. Bush, the compassionate conservative center rightist, almost rhino. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1488.24s)]
*  This guy, he's a real right winger and he's like you and he's different than that. And then [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1493.36s)]
*  it's just the same old thing. You just get a separate group. You got Continetti, who's like [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1498.96s)]
*  Bill Kristol's son-in-law and Elliott Abrams, his brother-in-law instead of Bill Kristol, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1503.36s)]
*  which I guess Kristol didn't work for Bush. But anyway, you know what I mean? Basically, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1509.36s)]
*  hate Trump and Trump hates Kristol back, but Trump's family's in his government. So I mean, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1514.08s)]
*  Kristol's, God dang it, is in Trump's government. So they get what they want anyway. They just [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1519.76s)]
*  change it up. And so if people are getting sick and tired of Fox News and more and more they're [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1527.12s)]
*  turning to podcasts, then they'll do whatever they can to turn the new podcast environment [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1531.52s)]
*  their way. And I don't know a lot about those others. I know that Tim Poole knows better. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1538.1599999999999s)]
*  And I liked him. He's had me on a show a couple of times and I appreciate it. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1546.9599999999998s)]
*  And he's said over the years that like, well, we should just not have anything to do with it. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1551.6s)]
*  The US should just not pay for either side and we should stay out of it, which is a bit of a cop out [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1558.48s)]
*  in the middle of America doing what they're doing. You know, but it's almost the same as saying we [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1563.44s)]
*  should stop doing what we're doing, but go ahead and meeting with Netanyahu and saying, yeah, geez, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1568.24s)]
*  we sure want to help you fight antisemitism, which just is code for anti-Israel sentiment in America. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1573.68s)]
*  We got to do what we can to shore up the YouTube right-wing audience for Zion here is, first of [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1580.24s)]
*  all, it's ridiculous. It's a losing strategy. Again, like you were saying before, you guys really [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1587.44s)]
*  want people to like your country. You should try being cool because all this stuff of just doing [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1592.64s)]
*  the wrong thing and then falsely accusing people of antisemitism and censoring them and shaming [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1598.4s)]
*  them and all of this stuff, it's not going to work. Look, it's the same thing as the NAFO trolls who [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1603.0400000000002s)]
*  were, you know, USAID paid all these people to just, you know, basically troll and hate on any [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1608.48s)]
*  Americans who are good on Ukraine. But all that did was piss us all off and make us all recommitted. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1614.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, to arguing our side of the argument, it's not like they intimidated anyone off the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1621.76s)]
*  internet. They'd have done a hell of a lot better to say, oh, but my friend, don't you see my point [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1627.04s)]
*  of view? Instead of coming at everybody, you know, turned all the way up to 11 the way that they did. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1632.72s)]
*  It just backfired on them. And with Israel, it's the same thing too. And like you're saying, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  it's wild, dude. It's such a cell phone footage, man. That's the thing of it. If you just type in [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1644.56s)]
*  Gaza on X and look at the pictures, you can see them every single day. The killing of innocent [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1649.84s)]
*  people. And it wasn't like that in Iraq War Two. It wasn't like that even in the Syria Dirty War. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1655.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, there was a lot of pictures out of it, but it was nothing like what we get out of Gaza now, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1660.72s)]
*  where it's just in real time, you see these people being killed, the entire family's being [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1664.3999999999999s)]
*  killed like this. It's just horrific. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1669.1999999999998s)]
*  for today's show, a brand new sponsor who we're thrilled to have on board and that is Brunt. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1674.88s)]
*  Choosing work boots used to mean sacrificing comfort or durability. If they felt good, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1680.0800000000002s)]
*  they didn't last. And if they lasted, they wrecked your feet. But Brunk Workwear finally ended that [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1685.6000000000001s)]
*  trade off by designing boots that withstand the toughest job sites while feeling as comfortable [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1691.44s)]
*  as your favorite sneakers. Their founder, Eric, grew up blue collar and started Brunt after his [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1696.88s)]
*  friends in the trades encouraged him to start a workwear brand that was really built for them. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1702.8s)]
*  That's why all Brunt products are named after the guys he grew up with. These might be the most [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1708.48s)]
*  comfortable work boots on the planet, but they also deliver real performance on the job. I can [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1714.08s)]
*  tell you they just sent me a pair of them. Not only are they very comfortable, they're really [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1718.8s)]
*  cool looking too. And they're just great work boots. If you're in the market for that, you gotta [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1723.12s)]
*  check out Brunt. They're comfortable right out of the box. Most other boots require a significant [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1727.76s)]
*  break in period, but not Brunt. They offer a full range of high performance gear built for [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1733.28s)]
*  tough jobs from heavy duty work pants to weather resilient jackets. Brunt designs durable, reliable [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1738.16s)]
*  workwear to keep you protected and productive in any condition. Brunt didn't just make a durable [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1744.56s)]
*  work boot. They reinvented comfort for the hardest workers out there. And for a limited time for our [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1750.96s)]
*  listeners, you can get $10 off at bruntworkwear.com when you use the promo code problem. That's brunt [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1756.72s)]
*  workwear.com promo code problem for $10 off. All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1764.16s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's, that's exactly right. And, and even, you know, if you remember, um, when Donald [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1770.56s)]
*  Trump bombed Syria in 2017, this was the moment that like the entire media all of a sudden was [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1776.24s)]
*  fine with Donald Trump and Brian Williams was talking about how beautiful it is. And he was [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1783.92s)]
*  playing, but the images that he's showing are, you know, these crazy zoomed out aerial images. It [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1789.44s)]
*  looks like a fireworks show almost. And so it's kind of easy to look at a fireworks show and say, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1794.88s)]
*  that's beautiful. You know, now it's still pretty sickening because you're like, Jesus, you do know [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1800.24s)]
*  that these are bombs being dropped on human beings, but okay. But it's a real different thing. When [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1804.64s)]
*  you got an HD camera from the ground perspective, I mean, that's just drastically different. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1810.64s)]
*  And your point about the NAFO, NAFO trolls, I believe because I grappled with them quite a bit, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1815.44s)]
*  uh, over the years, but again, it was, you know, I'll get sometimes, you know, you just see, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1822.3200000000002s)]
*  and I've been, I've been, you know, on Twitter and in the comments a little bit more than usual [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1827.2s)]
*  over the last week, because it's just been such a kind of crazy storm, but you know, you'll see [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1831.68s)]
*  people every now and then like, they'll just tweet something. It'll just be like some random [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1837.36s)]
*  person or a bot or whatever. I don't know, but they'll just tweet. They'll just be like, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1842.0s)]
*  you're ignorant. You don't know what you're talking about. You should just shut up and go back to [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1845.84s)]
*  comedy. They almost like look at this tweet and you're like, so what's the, what do you think? I [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1849.6s)]
*  made it to this point. And then I'm going to see a tweet like that and go, ah, shucks. I probably [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1854.9599999999998s)]
*  should just go shut up. And you're like, you're totally right. That like all those NAFO guys, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1861.4399999999998s)]
*  they would have been better off by just be trying at least to be cool and go, look, I see your side, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1865.2s)]
*  but like, you know, could you maybe think about what it's like for the Ukrainians or something [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1870.96s)]
*  like that? You just be better off than just attacking it this way. And, uh, you know, the [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1874.4s)]
*  strategy so far, and, and look, I do think part of this with all of these things is that there's been [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1880.56s)]
*  a system for so long, like this has worked for so long and now it's just a new reality and it's [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1887.84s)]
*  very difficult for, for some people to adjust to the facts on the ground. But the, the strategy [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1896.8799999999999s)]
*  of what we're going to do is we're going to call every critic of Israel who's not at all a Jew [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1902.9599999999998s)]
*  hater an anti-Semite. And then somehow that's going to like solve this problem is that all you're [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1908.6399999999999s)]
*  doing is just driving more and more people to the consensus that it's insane that you're not [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1915.84s)]
*  allowed to talk about this shit. And it's just fucking crazy. It just makes no sense. Douglas [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1921.36s)]
*  Moore, you could say, Oh, if you haven't been to the region or whatever, it's like, listen, man, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1925.9199999999998s)]
*  first off, you don't have to be, you don't have to be a taxpayer. You don't have to be to the region [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1929.76s)]
*  to have an opinion on this, but the idea that you are a taxpayer and you don't get to have a thought [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1933.28s)]
*  about what you're being forced to fund is just, this is make that argument all you want. If [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1940.72s)]
*  that's what you guys on the other side have, I will take that the parameters of that debate. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1946.56s)]
*  I mean, I think about what that means. What percentage of Americans have ever been to Israel, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1951.3600000000001s)]
*  right? Like a 10th of a percent or less, probably less than that. So all the rest of us, we just [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1956.08s)]
*  have to shut up and let Israel use our country and our government and our weapons however they want. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1961.84s)]
*  And I'm bummed I didn't get to make this point on Pierce Morgan today when I was arguing with Alan [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1968.72s)]
*  Dershowitz, but I like bringing this up. Not enough people know this that Israel caused September 11th [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1972.64s)]
*  and I don't think that they did it. And I'm not saying that, but they did cause it and they cause [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1978.88s)]
*  it because when Bill Clinton came into power, he wanted to normalize relations with Iraq and Iran. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1983.6000000000001s)]
*  But Israel insisted that no, you can't normalize relations with either. You have to stay in Saudi [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1990.64s)]
*  Arabia to enforce what they call the dual containment policy. That comes from Israel. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=1996.24s)]
*  The guy who insisted upon it was named Martin Indyk and Martin Indyk had worked for Yitzhak [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2000.88s)]
*  Shamir, the Likud party prime minister of Israel in the early 1990s. And then he went from there- [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2008.48s)]
*  And Zionist terrorists before that. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2013.52s)]
*  Yeah, and a terrorist before that. And then he went to work for Bill Clinton. Now, he was the [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2015.44s)]
*  founder of what's called the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, which was officially [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2021.28s)]
*  financed and spun off from AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. And then in 1993, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2025.6000000000001s)]
*  he was pushing and pushing, but it wasn't until the Kuwaitis faked the ridiculous pretend hoax [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2032.64s)]
*  plot against Bush senior in Kuwait in 1993, which people still believe to this day that Saddam tried [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2038.64s)]
*  to kill Bush senior, but it's totally a hoax and Seymour Hersh debunked it in The New Yorker. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2044.72s)]
*  In fact, if you Google my name and Bush senior and stuff like that on Twitter, I mean, on X, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2049.2799999999997s)]
*  you'll see where I put screenshots of the entire New Yorker article that if you copy the address [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2055.52s)]
*  of the pictures, you can zoom in on them and read the entire thing for free there if you can find [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2062.32s)]
*  that. But anyway, it was just a whiskey smuggling ring that they spun into this truck bomb plot [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2066.72s)]
*  against Bush senior, which was a lie. But then in response to that lie, Bill Clinton, and you [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2071.2s)]
*  might remember this from the Bill Hicks joke, Bill Clinton bombed Baghdad and fired a bunch of [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2075.36s)]
*  cruise missiles at Baghdad. He killed this famous artist and a bunch of other innocent people. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2079.6s)]
*  And at that time, that was when he decided to go ahead and inaugurate the dual containment policy. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2085.44s)]
*  And that meant staying in Iraq in the name of enforcing the no fly zones over Iraq, sorry, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2091.36s)]
*  staying in Saudi in the name of forcing the no fly zones over Iraq, as though Saddam hadn't already [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2096.1600000000003s)]
*  successfully put down the insurrections in the Shiite south and the Kurdish north. It's not like [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2101.52s)]
*  he was trying to kill every last Shiite. He just put down the insurrection that was over by the end [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2107.2s)]
*  of April of 1991. So it was just a hoax of an excuse to stay there. But America, partially at [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2112.72s)]
*  Israeli encouragement, had beat up Saddam Hussein's army so bad, he wasn't powerful enough to balance [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2120.08s)]
*  against Iran anymore. And so they needed America to stay to balance against both. And so that was [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2125.36s)]
*  the primary cause of Al Qaeda, America, Britain and Saudis mercenary gang of Islamist killers from [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2131.04s)]
*  the Afghan and Bosnia wars, and etc. to turn against the United States. And then the secondary [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2137.52s)]
*  reason after that was support for Israel and their violence against the Palestinians and the [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2144.0s)]
*  Lebanese. And it was the Operation Grapes of Wrath by Shimon Peres in 1996, which included, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2148.56s)]
*  I think, on the second or third day of the invasion, Naftali Bennett, the former Israeli [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2158.4s)]
*  prime minister, and probably will be again someday, right wing nationalist prime minister, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2164.1600000000003s)]
*  he was the army officer who called in an artillery strike on a UN shelter and killed 106 women and [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2168.48s)]
*  children. Now, when Shimon Peres launched Grapes of Wrath, that day, Mohammed Atta and Ramzi Ben [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2175.1200000000003s)]
*  al-Shib filled out their last will and testament, which was them symbolically joining the army, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2182.88s)]
*  saying that one day they're going to figure out how to get revenge against Israel for this. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2187.28s)]
*  And then a few months later, Bin Laden put out his first declaration of war, the declaration of war [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2191.84s)]
*  against the Americans occupying the land of the two holy places, it was called. And in there, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2197.6800000000003s)]
*  he starts out talking about the Khana massacre. It's now the first Khana massacre because they [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2203.2000000000003s)]
*  did it again in 2006. Sorry. But he goes on there and he says, we'll never forget the severed heads [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2207.28s)]
*  and limbs of the little babies that were killed in Khana. Well, this is what made Mohammed Atta [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2213.36s)]
*  and Ramzi Ben al-Shib decide to join Al Qaeda. And that's according to Lawrence Wright in the [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2218.4s)]
*  Looming Tower. And that's according to Terry McDermott in Perfect Soldiers. And they said, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2223.36s)]
*  so here's Egyptian graduate students, upper middle-class graduate students studying [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2228.48s)]
*  engineering in Hamburg, Germany, decide to go and volunteer for a Saudi to get revenge on Americans. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2234.32s)]
*  And so they're going to get revenge for supporting Israel and Lebanon. And instead of explaining [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2243.36s)]
*  that to the American people, they said, they hate us because we're free. They hate us because we're [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2248.6400000000003s)]
*  cool. They hate us because, hey, 2001 is the first day of history all over again. And nothing that [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2252.1600000000003s)]
*  Bill Clinton did in the nineties could have anything to do with this. And so we kicked off [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2259.04s)]
*  a whole new generation of war based on the September 11th attack that was revenge for the [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2262.7200000000003s)]
*  grievances by Al Qaeda against the United States, where the dual containment policy from bases in [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2268.7999999999997s)]
*  Saudi and support for Israel and their violence against the Palestinians and the Lebanese. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2274.16s)]
*  And that is quite literally what drove Mohammed Atta to drive Flight 11 into the North Tower. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2278.3999999999996s)]
*  If I got the planes and the towers right, I think I do. So in other words, supporting Israel is [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2285.9199999999996s)]
*  against America's national interest. Yeah, there you go. And that's not even without touching all [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2291.4399999999996s)]
*  the wars that followed from that, which is really what has really tremendously degraded the country. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2297.92s)]
*  It's funny that people, like when I was in my, when I debated Josh Hammer at Princeton, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2306.16s)]
*  and his big moment of the debate, I think the only moment that people claimed were like he [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2314.64s)]
*  landed a blow, which is so ridiculous, is when he asked me who I trust more, Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2320.96s)]
*  or Osama bin Laden. And it's so weird. But as you've always said, as I've echoed many times, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2326.96s)]
*  and it's like, look, even if nobody here is really making the argument that like, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2333.52s)]
*  we can read Osama bin Laden's mind, or that we can see into his heart and know what he really means. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2338.16s)]
*  So even if you want to claim, which is like not an unreasonable claim that he didn't really mean any [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2345.6s)]
*  of that stuff. He's just using this and you know, he was a religious fanatic or whatever. It's like, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2350.8s)]
*  okay, but why is he using this? Why is he using this? Because this is what will actually recruit [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2356.96s)]
*  people to be willing to blow themselves up. And I was trying to make this point in the Douglas [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2362.96s)]
*  Murray debate. Also, when I, you know, I brought up the Staltenberg, you know, mentioning that he [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2366.96s)]
*  had sent a draft treaty to NATO in late 2001 and saying, listen, just put it in writing that you're [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2373.6s)]
*  not going to bring Ukraine into NATO, and I won't invade the country. And they refused. And you're [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2379.36s)]
*  like, okay, so even if you're saying, if you want to say, which again, weirdly, they go, so you trust [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2384.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, and then he claims that Vladimir Putin has said that he wants to reconstitute the [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2390.0s)]
*  Soviet Union, which by the way, is not true. There's nobody can point to a quote where he said that [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2395.52s)]
*  he has said things about how like, how sad it was that the Soviet Union collapsed or something like [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2399.92s)]
*  that. But number one, so you're just trusting what he said a different time. But even if you want to [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2404.8s)]
*  say that that's his true motivation, like you can see into his soul, and we can't, and his true [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2411.52s)]
*  motivation is wanting to reconstitute the Soviet Union. It's like, so why not at least call his [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2415.92s)]
*  bluff then? Why not at least like put that into writing and then take away his major talking point? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2420.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like even if what you're saying is correct, it still doesn't make any sense [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2426.32s)]
*  to give him this giant talking point and give him this plausible case for why he felt that way. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2431.2s)]
*  None of it makes any sense. So I was just debating right before this show is debating with, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2438.24s)]
*  there's always too many people on, but I was up against Alan Dershowitz. And we're talking about [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2442.7999999999997s)]
*  Massad, but it kept getting diverted off onto Iran and their nuclear program and all this. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2448.0s)]
*  And Dershowitz his point about Iran, of course, when he wasn't contradicting himself, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2452.08s)]
*  is that they are implacable. They are an implacable enemy. There's nothing that you could ever do to [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2457.04s)]
*  reason with them. And this is the same thing that they said about David Koresh and the same thing [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2462.72s)]
*  they said about Saddam Hussein, the same thing they say about Vladimir Putin and against Osama [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2466.32s)]
*  bin Laden too. And the thing is, like, well, Koresh never murdered anybody, but for the rest of them, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2472.0s)]
*  I think it's a perfectly acceptable standard. I'm not sure like where I learned this, but I think [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2479.92s)]
*  I like accepted this at boyhood when I was very young that like, yeah, if somebody's a murderer, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2485.28s)]
*  then that also means that their word is no good. Like, okay, so that's fair. You know what I mean? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2490.48s)]
*  Like, yeah, I don't expect you to believe what a blood soaked killer says. It's not a matter of, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2495.2s)]
*  but however, it's not a matter of believing them. It's a matter of, you know, analysis here. He's, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2501.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, Murray tried to pull this on you when you cited the former ambassador to Russia and [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2508.3199999999997s)]
*  then later CIA director warning Connolly's arise, don't offer NATO membership to Ukraine. It's [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2513.2s)]
*  going to cause Russia to react and go, oh, now you believe the head of the CIA, like he was whispering [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2519.2s)]
*  secrets in your ear rather than this is a leak document of him warning his superior why we should [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2524.88s)]
*  not do the foolhardy thing we're going to do. So it's not a matter of like, what to the, what planet [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2530.32s)]
*  are the aliens really from Mr. CIA director? Tell me your secret, right? This is like, it has nothing [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2536.0s)]
*  to do with that at all. So it's the same thing with Bin Laden, as you said, and this is absolutely [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2541.28s)]
*  the right answer. Here's a guy who killed 3000 American civilians or almost all of them civilians. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2546.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, and then he says he has reasons like screw him. I don't even want to hear it. I don't care [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2550.64s)]
*  what he says his reasons are, but I do care why, what reasons he used to recruit 20 guys to hijack [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2556.08s)]
*  our planes and crash them into our targets. Cause what matters there is what he said to them that [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2564.64s)]
*  was convincing. And that's where we go right back to what I was just telling you about Ramsey Ben [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2569.68s)]
*  Al-Shib and Mohammed Atta in declaration of war. He called us infidels and all of that stuff, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2573.44s)]
*  but it starts with the Kana massacre, right? It starts with America helped Israel kill these babies [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2580.16s)]
*  calling all who seek vengeance. And that was, that's right. That's right. And even the, um, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2587.12s)]
*  his later, uh, letter to America that went super viral, uh, a little over a year ago on tick tock. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2593.3599999999997s)]
*  Um, even in that one where there will point to like, there's some Islamist stuff in there for [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2599.2799999999997s)]
*  sure. And he talks about like Sharia law and all these things, but the, but it opens with why do [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2605.04s)]
*  we attack you simple because you attack us. You can't get away from that. It's right there at the [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2611.12s)]
*  beginning. And the other point I would add to this too, is that it is, you know, this, this question [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2618.16s)]
*  of like trust first of the Murray thing, try not get like, it's just so ridiculous. I mean, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2623.52s)]
*  libertarians have an advantage cause we're just more clear headed on this stuff, but he's like, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2628.64s)]
*  wait, so you're telling me you think the CIA should be abolished, but you're also telling me [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2632.48s)]
*  that it's important that the head of the CIA admitted that this was the real cause of the [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2636.88s)]
*  wards. Like, yes, I am telling you both of those things. I think those things are true. There's no [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2641.28s)]
*  contradiction between them blown away, man. Wow. But you know, with the, um, with this stuff, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2645.92s)]
*  with Ben Laden, trusting Ben Laden verse Netanyahu, you know, your point is well taken. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2652.08s)]
*  If you're a murderer, you're where way past the point of being a liar. That being said, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2656.32s)]
*  they don't like to count state murder, but Benjamin Netanyahu has actually killed a whole [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2661.36s)]
*  lot more people than Osama bin Laden has. So he also loses credibility by that same standard. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2665.1200000000003s)]
*  But the other thing is not mom intense killing little babies. Yes, that's yeah, that's right. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2670.96s)]
*  I was just reading about that this morning. Um, but it's also like, you know, if, if I look out [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2676.1600000000003s)]
*  my window and I see, you know, like a, a blood soaked man with a butcher knife and he's screaming, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2683.28s)]
*  I'm going to kill you and your entire family, I'm going to treat him as if those are his intentions. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2690.0s)]
*  And you could say, Oh, you trust a man with a butcher knife covered in blood. And you're like, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2696.8s)]
*  well, he's really got no reason to lie to me right now. And it sure does seem like he means that. And [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2700.64s)]
*  so like when you're a fanatic, like Osama bin Laden dedicated to the destruction of America and [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2705.6s)]
*  Israel, you really have no incentive to lie about it. You've already made yourself most wanted man. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2712.16s)]
*  You've already, you're going up against the empire. Whereas if you're a politician like Benjamin [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2718.32s)]
*  Netanyahu, who's coming to testify before our Congress and trying to move policy in the direction [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2723.92s)]
*  that you want, that's a kind of different thing. Then you are incentivized to lie. So like, yeah, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2730.7200000000003s)]
*  like it's not even a comment on like, who's a better person or who's a worse person. It's just [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2737.44s)]
*  like these two men occupy different positions right now. And yes, I do think that Osama bin Laden, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2742.64s)]
*  like my best guess is like that he meant it when he said this. And my best guess is that Benjamin [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2749.6s)]
*  Netanyahu knew that Iran wasn't five years away from a nuke every single time he said it and was [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2755.8399999999997s)]
*  still coming out and saying it because he was trying to move America's war policy toward toppling [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2761.04s)]
*  the mullahs. I don't think there's anything about that. That's unreasonable. And you know, like [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2766.64s)]
*  so it was like, oh, I prefer the enemies of America to its allies or something like that. It's like, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2771.2s)]
*  no, I view both these men as enemies of America. I view both of them as mass murderers. Yet one is [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2777.3599999999997s)]
*  in a position where he's very incentivized to lie to me. And the other one really isn't. I think [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2782.56s)]
*  that's reasonable. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2787.04s)]

*  let's get back into the show. Yeah. And look, I mean, I'm sure Bin Laden, same with Putin and [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2829.68s)]
*  the rest of these guys, they A B test their propaganda to see what's effective. You know [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2835.2s)]
*  what I mean? So again, take their intent out of it and just look at what works. And you know, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2839.6s)]
*  Michael Scheuer, the former chief of the Bin Laden unit, and he's great to cite on this because man, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2845.52s)]
*  he's the former chief of the Bin Laden unit. He goes, look, all through the 1990s. It's like, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2851.2s)]
*  yeah, yeah, yeah, there's some religious mumbo jumbo mixed in there. But the argument explicitly [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2855.68s)]
*  and repeatedly was America bombs Iraq from bases in Saudi and also the blockade is starving the [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2861.6s)]
*  civilian population with the embargo. They support Israel in their oppression of the Palestinians and [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2869.7599999999998s)]
*  the Lebanese. They support every dictator in the region, particularly King Abdullah and Hasni [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2878.72s)]
*  Mubarak in Saudi and Egypt, who they wanted to overthrow the Al Qaeda guys. So pressure on those [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2883.9199999999996s)]
*  dictatorships to rig oil prices, to subsidize America's economy at their expense. People say [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2890.9599999999996s)]
*  that's crazy, but just ask yourself, haven't you heard politicians every time it's a presidential [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2899.04s)]
*  election year, doesn't the president put pressure open, open pressure on Saudi Arabia to increase [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2903.04s)]
*  production to lower the cost of fuel in the United States? Yeah, that's exactly what they're [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2908.08s)]
*  talking about. And then he also accused us of turning a blind eye toward Russia, China, India, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2912.24s)]
*  and Kazakhstan in their wars against Muslims and saying, oh, human rights only count when [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2917.12s)]
*  it serves your interests in this place or that one. And as I show in my new book, all of America's [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2922.64s)]
*  efforts on behalf of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, in Bosnia and Kosovo and Chechnya didn't buy us [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2927.36s)]
*  any goodwill from them at all. And Bin Laden denounced us for, after all those years of helping [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2932.8s)]
*  the Mujahideen in Bosnia, then selling them short and screwing them over and denying them their [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2939.52s)]
*  final victory that they supposedly were going to win. I call them the ungrateful terrorists, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2945.28s)]
*  where if you look at the 9-11 hijackers, 11 of the 19 hijackers had fought on America's side or [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2950.0800000000004s)]
*  America had fought on their side, supported their side in Bosnia and Chechnya. And these were the [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2956.6400000000003s)]
*  guys who then turned around and did the September 11th attack. And then even I quote Ali Soufan, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2961.44s)]
*  the former FBI agent, who said that the Chechens would say to Bin Laden, hey, what do you have [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2966.56s)]
*  against America? They supported us in Bosnia and Kosovo, oh, pardon me, in Afghanistan and [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2974.0s)]
*  Bosnia and Kosovo and now in Chechnya. And you want to mess with them? And Bin Laden answered that, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2980.08s)]
*  like, you guys just don't understand the broader vision. It's all about Israel. It's all about [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2986.56s)]
*  bombing Iraq from bases on the Holy and Arabian Peninsula, birthplace of Islam. And so yeah, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2990.8s)]
*  we're doing this. And then this is, of course, a big part of why the Americans didn't have [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=2996.32s)]
*  their proper eye trained on their enemies is because their enemies were their assets working [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3001.92s)]
*  for them. And particularly, it isn't it interesting that particularly as you cover in the book and [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3005.6000000000004s)]
*  provoked, there's a whole section on this, but the Chechnya, you know, it's like, so we're backing [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3012.96s)]
*  the Bin Ladenites in Chechnya. And not only does that not work to win us any favor with the [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3018.32s)]
*  Bin Ladenites, but it really damaged our relationship with Russia. And in fact, this [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3026.48s)]
*  is one of the first things that Vladimir Putin brings up in his interview with Tucker once they [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3031.36s)]
*  start getting into it. And you could imagine, you know, it's like, like, I knew this fact. And I [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3036.1600000000003s)]
*  guess I knew this, I think from you, I think from reading your book is like the first I learned [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3041.2000000000003s)]
*  about Chechnya. I think you had told me about it, you know, over the years, but I never really did [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3045.84s)]
*  a deep dive on it already about it. But yeah, that's right. You mentioned that's right. You [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3050.2400000000002s)]
*  mentioned it enough already, but there's more in depth and provoked. But it wasn't until [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3054.8s)]
*  Vladimir Putin brought it up that you go like, like, at least for me that I really appreciated [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3060.8s)]
*  the weight of that. We were like, oh, yeah, here is the US who at the time, right, is saying these [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3066.88s)]
*  nice things publicly. Like, you know, people kind of forget this, but that it's like Vladimir Putin [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3073.84s)]
*  wasn't described as an imperialist enemy of the West up until really it's really around Syria, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3078.88s)]
*  where it starts, like the rhetoric starts really ramping up. Cause of course he committed the [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3087.44s)]
*  ultimate crime, which is at least temporarily denying the U S a regime change. He wasn't [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3091.84s)]
*  ultimately successful in that, but up until then, you know, there's, there's the, you know, the great [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3097.6000000000004s)]
*  reset button thing with Hillary Clinton, George W. Bush says he looked into his eyes and he saw his [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3102.88s)]
*  soul or whatever. It's like the rhetoric was much different around him. But while they're saying [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3108.08s)]
*  these nice things publicly about Russia, they're backing the most dangerous, violent terrorist [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3112.7200000000003s)]
*  groups right in their neighborhood. And like, what an unbelievable, like for them, we forget, forget [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3119.92s)]
*  all the other stuff, just that, what a provocation that is. And so we, as a result, America gets the [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3124.7200000000003s)]
*  worst of all worlds. We still have these terrorists. We just now have more war hardened terrorists [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3130.56s)]
*  and we win no favor with them. And it comes with this small price tag of alienating the country [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3137.12s)]
*  with the biggest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world. What a great foreign policy win. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3143.12s)]
*  And yet I still have the nerve to question the experts. So somehow. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3147.84s)]
*  I dare you. Well, look, and this is an important story, I think, and it's kind of, I hope a touchstone [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3151.84s)]
*  for people that if people remember Colleen Rowley, she was Time Magazine Person of the [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3156.64s)]
*  Year in 2002 because she was the great whistleblower and FBI lawyer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. And she [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3161.92s)]
*  was on the case of Zacharias Musawi. He was the guy, they called him the 20th hijacker for a while, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3168.3199999999997s)]
*  but that wasn't really right. He was here for a later operation. It was Katani was supposed to be [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3173.12s)]
*  the 20th hijacker. Anyway, Musawi, he wanted to learn how to fly a jumbo jet, but he wasn't [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3177.12s)]
*  interested in learning how to take off or land. And so the guy at the, people might remember that, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3182.48s)]
*  I hope, the guy at the flight school, not even the bosses, but like one of the trainers at the [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3186.88s)]
*  flight school called the FBI on him. And they remember that World Trade Center had already [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3191.36s)]
*  been hit in 93. And so one of the FBI agents at the office even speculated, you know, this guy says [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3195.92s)]
*  he wants to fly from Heathrow to New York. I think maybe he wants to hit the World Trade Center. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3202.4s)]
*  So the FBI agents, they were just on it. Right. And he wasn't, that was based on, I guess, maybe [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3207.9199999999996s)]
*  he knew about Bojinka or whatever the plot from 1995. And so they were speculating, but on the [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3212.8799999999997s)]
*  right track. And then they went to get a FISA warrant, which has a much lower threshold than [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3220.16s)]
*  a regular probable cause search warrant. All they have to do is show the foreign intelligence [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3226.3199999999997s)]
*  surveillance court that they have a reason to believe that someone is an agent of a foreign [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3230.24s)]
*  power or a foreign terrorist group. It's like 99 plus percent of the warrants are granted by the [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3234.08s)]
*  FISA courts. Yeah. Like they've only turned down four or five in their entire history, something [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3239.6s)]
*  like that. So they already had intelligence from the French. This guy and his brother are both [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3243.52s)]
*  recruiters for Al Qaeda in Chechnya. And the bosses at the FBI headquarters refused to allow them to [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3249.7599999999998s)]
*  go and get a FISA warrant because they said, we like the terrorists in Chechnya. They're not [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3256.24s)]
*  Osama bin Ladenite terrorists. They're nationalist freedom fighters and we're on their side. And so [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3262.72s)]
*  that makes them not terrorists. And so that makes this guy Musawi not an agent of a foreign [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3269.12s)]
*  terrorist group then. And so, no, you can't search his stuff. And they would, and this was like in [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3273.8399999999997s)]
*  the middle of August, a month before the attack. And then only on the day of the attack, they then [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3278.08s)]
*  went back and said, please, can we search him now? And they said, no, you still can't go get a FISA [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3283.8399999999997s)]
*  warrant until finally the director of central intelligence, George Tenet said, I wonder if this [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3288.0s)]
*  has anything to do with that Minneapolis thing. And then he went and asked, and they said, okay, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3292.24s)]
*  fine, of course, he can go and get a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance court. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3296.7999999999997s)]
*  And they searched this guy's papers and the papers that were in his pocket and at his [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3300.3199999999997s)]
*  apartment led directly to Ramsey bin al-Sheb, the major 9-11 planner in Europe and his partner, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3306.3199999999997s)]
*  Mohammed Atta and his band of pilot hijackers down there in Florida. And so they absolutely [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3314.16s)]
*  could have wrapped up the plot and prevented September 11th. If America, if Bill Clinton, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3321.6s)]
*  and then the newly inherited George W. Bush government were not up to their eyeballs in [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3328.72s)]
*  high treason, supporting head chopping, suicide bombing bin Ladenite terrorists in Chechnya, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3333.8399999999997s)]
*  and Basiev and Katab both were absolutely sworn blood oath loyal to Osama bin Laden and met with [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3339.68s)]
*  him numerous times, had both been to Afghanistan to train. Katab wasn't even from Chechnya. He was a [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3345.68s)]
*  Saudi Osama bin Laden's agent there. BBC called him Osama bin Laden's junior partner in Chechnya. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3350.88s)]
*  That's exactly who these guys were. And because the Americans were playing that double game, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3357.92s)]
*  that was part of the reason that September 11th was able to succeed. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3363.12s)]
*  And it really is just unbelievable. Yeah. I mean, I know this because you've, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3366.8s)]
*  you've, you've told me this before and we've, I've read about it, but it really is like, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3371.92s)]
*  as you say, it's just unbelievable. I look where we are coming up against the end of the show here, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3376.16s)]
*  but I want to make sure it is switch gears a little bit because I want to ask you about this. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3382.0s)]
*  So you're the guy who wrote the book on, on this war and the lead up to it. Obviously [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3386.08s)]
*  Donald Trump campaigned on ending the war in a day. We are, I just checked. We are past that [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3393.92s)]
*  time limit and it hasn't been ended. Obviously the, the path that Donald Trump is taking is a, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3401.76s)]
*  is a big improvement over the path that Joe Biden took for the last two years of his presidency. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3409.5200000000004s)]
*  What's the latest? Do you think there's, there's hope of this thing wrapping up? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3416.48s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it's going quite as well as, as people may have hoped when, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3421.92s)]
*  when Trump was campaigning on ending it in a day. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3426.4s)]
*  Yeah. Well, look, I mean, I think Donald Trump is sincere in wanting to end it, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3429.44s)]
*  which is, you know, obviously a major improvement. The problem is that they're [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3433.84s)]
*  already in the middle of a war and the American slash Ukrainian side is in a position of weakness [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3439.92s)]
*  on the ground. The Russians are ascendant in every way on the battlefield and including, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3446.32s)]
*  they kicked the Ukrainians out of Kursk, which was the small salient that they had created [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3451.84s)]
*  actually inside Russia at the end of last summer. They've been, that's all now officially canceled. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3455.7599999999998s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence put out the threat assessment in February, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3462.48s)]
*  in late February that for one reiterated Iran ain't making nukes. Everybody double-checked that, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3467.2799999999997s)]
*  but also reiterated that Russia is, you know, having their way essentially with the Ukrainian [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3472.96s)]
*  army at slow and steady progress. I don't know if they're directly comparing casualty rates in [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3478.7999999999997s)]
*  there. I don't think that they do. I never believe anybody's casualty claims because everybody [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3483.52s)]
*  always plays down their own and exaggerates the enemies. But even, even if, which they are on the [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3487.84s)]
*  offensive, so I guess it's within the realm of possibility, even if the Russians are losing more [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3494.16s)]
*  guys than the Ukrainians are, which is doubtful because I think they're much better equipped, but [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3499.52s)]
*  even if that were the case, they still have a lot more men and they still have a much bigger economy [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3505.12s)]
*  and a much more militarized economy and a much more, a much greater ability to field an army [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3510.64s)]
*  in their neighboring country here as they have done. And I'm sorry, I forget the number, but they [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3517.8399999999997s)]
*  have dropped thousands of these glide bombs where they took these old storehouses full of old Soviet [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3522.16s)]
*  dumb bombs and they attached fancy new glide kits on them with GPS or whatever equivalent their [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3527.68s)]
*  guidance packages on these old dumb bombs left over from the 50s or wherever. And they just have [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3533.68s)]
*  thousands of these things and they can fire them from standoff ranges. In other words, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3538.56s)]
*  inside Russia where the Ukrainians can't defend from them at all. And so, pardon me, I'm too much [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3543.04s)]
*  on that point. What I'm trying to get at is that Donald Trump doesn't really have any threats to [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3551.6s)]
*  make. He can say that he'll put in more weapons, but we already tried that. There's a new New York [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3559.7599999999998s)]
*  Times story that shows how they escalated and escalated, crossed their own red lines over and [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3565.2s)]
*  over. Most of that was already admitted and already documented in my book. They said, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3569.04s)]
*  oh, we're not going to do this. And then they did it anyway with the more sophisticated and [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3573.2s)]
*  longer range weapons systems. That hasn't made the difference on the battlefield at all. And [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3577.52s)]
*  then we can threaten more sanctions, but at some point that just becomes completely counterproductive [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3582.7999999999997s)]
*  where we're threatening to put the whole world under blockade or forbid the whole world from [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3587.68s)]
*  trading with us if they trade with Russia at all. But so many countries are adjacent to Russia or [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3591.84s)]
*  nearby. And there's just so many more nations in Asia that all are close to Russia and have some [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3596.56s)]
*  kind of trading relationship with them. That could just end up with us getting shut out. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3603.6800000000003s)]
*  And then at that point, Donald Trump is out of cards to play really. He's not sending an 82nd [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3608.6400000000003s)]
*  airborne, that's for sure. And he has an uncooperative government in Kiev that for [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3614.08s)]
*  whatever reasons exactly, I'm not fully sure what is the calculation there, but they want to [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3618.32s)]
*  keep fighting even though they're still losing and they're having to impress men with impressment [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3623.44s)]
*  gangs going around conscripting people straight out of the bars and off of the streets. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3628.56s)]
*  And they're steadily losing ground here. They're trying, I guess, to extort greater security [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3634.6400000000003s)]
*  guarantees from the Europeans, which is just a matter of logic. If Britain and France aren't [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3639.76s)]
*  willing to field an army in Ukraine right now to repel the Russians right now, then why would they [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3646.88s)]
*  be willing to do it in five years? If they have these numbers there, if Russia comes back, they're [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3651.76s)]
*  just going to hightail it and run. They're not going to bring their whole army. They don't have [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3655.6800000000003s)]
*  field armies really capable of bringing into Ukraine to fight anyway. So the security guarantees, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3659.84s)]
*  de facto NATO membership from our European allied countries and all that, they're not going to stick, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3668.48s)]
*  they're not going to be able to probably even win those concessions in the first place. And I doubt [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3674.0s)]
*  that even if they were able to, that they'd be meaningful at all. If we really meant to protect [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3678.88s)]
*  Ukraine, they would have already got membership in NATO and article five guarantee and we'd be at [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3684.16s)]
*  war with Russia right now, but nobody's doing that. Joe Biden on his worst day wasn't prepared to do [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3689.52s)]
*  that. And so what that means then, where does that leave us, Dave? I think it means that the Russians [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3694.72s)]
*  are going to continue fighting until they feel like quitting, which could be until they're done [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3701.04s)]
*  completely breaking the Ukrainian army and then walking around and taking whatever territory they [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3707.6s)]
*  want. Maybe they want to go all the way to the Dnieper river. Maybe in the South they want to [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3711.92s)]
*  go all the way and seize Odessa. That'd be a hell of a fight, but I don't know what Putin thinks [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3717.12s)]
*  about this. I know he joked around like, yeah, Odessa's got nice weather there and stuff, but [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3723.36s)]
*  I know that there are people in Russian politics to his right who would be saying that, listen, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3727.68s)]
*  we've come this far. We're not stopping. You better not stop short of Kharkiv and short of Odessa. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3733.2799999999997s)]
*  These are historically Russian cities and we're taking them back. And of course there's that strip [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3739.2s)]
*  of land, remember Transnistria on the Moldovan Ukrainian border. So might as well keep going [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3743.68s)]
*  now. It's occupied by Russian troops under Russian control. Might as well keep going now [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3750.4s)]
*  all the way from Crimea to Odessa and then all the way to Transnistria. And then that way, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3754.72s)]
*  you're going to have this rump state of right-wing ethnic Ukrainian nationalists who hate your guts [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3760.24s)]
*  after the peace. Well, at least they'll be completely screwed because you'll take their giant, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3764.9599999999996s)]
*  the pearl of the Black Sea, the shipping port city of Odessa away from them. So it makes some [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3770.3999999999996s)]
*  sense from the Russian point of view to do that. On the other hand, of course, Dave, if they do that, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3776.72s)]
*  they're making a chump out of president Trump and they're making his best effort to end the war [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3781.2s)]
*  completely fruitless and make him look humiliated and embarrassed. And then that would really suck [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3785.76s)]
*  because geez, from the Russian point of view, they're never going to get a president not because [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3792.96s)]
*  they own him or have him compromised. They're never going to get a president who is as willing [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3797.12s)]
*  to get along with Russia, who even wants rapprochement with Russia, rapprochement, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3804.2400000000002s)]
*  and to get along with them, to normalize relations back with them. And they ought, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3809.84s)]
*  that's the countervailing incentive there is if they want to fix things with the United States [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3815.2s)]
*  of America, they need to do this as quickly as they can before Trump is so humiliated that he [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3820.32s)]
*  finds ways to double down and then make things worse. So I sure hope that the Russians are [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3826.08s)]
*  willing to compromise. They haven't taken Harkeev or Odessa yet. And I hope that they're willing to [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3832.56s)]
*  stop short in order to preserve what's left of America's relationship with Russia, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3837.92s)]
*  because despite all Trump's talk, he's not getting a third term. Right. And so what happens after [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3844.2400000000002s)]
*  this is going to depend very greatly, not that I would favor that, but what happens next going to [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3849.2000000000003s)]
*  depend very greatly on what Trump and Putin can work out right now. And the good news is, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3854.16s)]
*  Trump's guy, Witkoff is talking with the Russians on a pretty consistent basis, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3859.36s)]
*  but I don't know how much progress they're really making. And I don't know what concessions the [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3863.92s)]
*  Russians might be prepared to give. After all, they've officially annexed all of Kursant and [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3868.8s)]
*  all of Zaprosia, but they don't occupy them. They occupy about half of each, I think they occupy [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3873.76s)]
*  more than three quarters of Donetsk, but not all of Donetsk. So, you know, I don't know, man, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3879.92s)]
*  it doesn't look good. And by the way, it's an absolute horror show and people are just getting [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3886.48s)]
*  blown to bits over there. It's, yeah, you would pray, you'd pray and hope that, you know, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3890.8s)]
*  Vladimir Putin does just say enough's enough and kind of override the right wingers who might be [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3897.28s)]
*  pushing for more. And it's, yeah, it is horrible. And he certainly has a lot of responsibility for [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3902.8s)]
*  this whole thing, as you point out in the book, but it also, it's hard for me to not be left with [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3908.7200000000003s)]
*  the point that even Douglas Murray conceded in the debate. So here's something we all could agree [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3913.52s)]
*  with, right? But his point about the Libya model being such a disaster and being like, oh, the guy [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3917.76s)]
*  denuclearizes and then you kill them anyway. Well, now you just ruin this incentive. And it does. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3922.7200000000003s)]
*  And again, if people haven't read the book yet, I highly recommend you do, because it does just [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3928.0s)]
*  give you this perspective on like, yeah, this is the problem with the incentive structure you create [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3932.8s)]
*  when for so many years, Russia was willing to deal and play ball and you slap them in the face every [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3938.4s)]
*  single time they extend their hand. You do kind of incentivize this thing like, well, no, what am [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3945.2s)]
*  I going to do? Trump's going to be out in a couple of years and then they're going to slap us in the [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3950.72s)]
*  face again. Anytime we try to be reasonable. All right, listen, I do, I got to wrap on this, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2-qojtQQI&t=3953.9199999999996s)]
