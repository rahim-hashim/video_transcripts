# Dave Smith  Scott Horton Provoked  Part Of The Problem 1207
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc)
*  What's up, what's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=0.0s)]
*  I am very happy, as I always am, to be joined by the great Scott Horton. Scott has been [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  everywhere lately promoting his wonderful new book, Provoked. It's been very cool to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=16.8s)]
*  see you kind of getting your flowers over this book. I kind of knew this was going to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=22.68s)]
*  be one that was going to make a big impact. And it's been cool to see you doing debates [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=27.92s)]
*  and on all of these shows. How's it been so far since last we talked, I think the book [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  had just come out, but how have you been enjoying the book tour so far? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=37.24s)]
*  Well, I can't get any other work done because I'm just doing nothing but interviews, but [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=41.04s)]
*  whatever I've I worked for no money for two and a half years. So now I got to sell the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=46.8s)]
*  thing. So I'm doing a lot of that. I know everybody's really anxious for the audio book [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=50.28s)]
*  to come out. I have recorded the HW Bush chapter and about a third, I guess, of Bill Clinton. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=55.76s)]
*  So those sections should be getting mastered and posted on my sub stack, which is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=64.64s)]
*  ScottHortonShow.com. Sometime soon, I hope I need to talk to my guy and catch up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=68.64s)]
*  And then I have tried to block out some time this weekend, like Thursday through Sunday. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=73.92s)]
*  I'm going to try to knock out as much of the audio book as I possibly can. That's going to be [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=79.6s)]
*  a sub stack series before it's on Audible because it's going to be like 45 hours long or something. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=83.92s)]
*  But that's happening. So I know a lot of people really prefer the audio version. It is coming. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=90.56s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know, man. I sold quite a few. It's done much better than my previous books, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=95.76s)]
*  that's for sure. And I've been getting on shows like outside of the Libertarian Movement, but [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=101.68s)]
*  left wing and right wing shows as well, trying to get the book out there for people. And [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=107.68s)]
*  you know what? People seem really receptive of it. And I haven't heard any sound criticism yet. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=112.16s)]
*  Just a bunch of Russian talking points, talking points. And like if you look on Amazon, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  they're all really great reviews at set. All of the one star reviews, you could tell none of them [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=124.24s)]
*  have read the book at all. They don't cite anything in there. One guy says, well, it was good at first, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=128.64s)]
*  but then he starts saying talking points, right? Like, give me a break, dude. He goes, I checked [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  it out from the library. This book isn't available in any library in America, dude. And there's, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=137.76s)]
*  you know, they say verified purchase under the comments, right? None of the one star reviews [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=144.48s)]
*  have a verified purchase under their name. They're all clearly just angry trolls from Twitter who came [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=149.12s)]
*  to lie. But none of them even, you know, they're so lazy. Seems like they could just buy the Kindle [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=154.32s)]
*  and quote something, you know, but nope. Yeah. Well, I said it to you, the last time you were [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=160.32s)]
*  on the show, and it's been just more kind of proven true because you've been doing more and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=166.8s)]
*  more of these appearances. But it is kind of amazing to me where it's like, there seem, it seems [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=171.28s)]
*  like there just is no counter argument that's really out there. There's basically two different [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  things that you will encounter. This is what I've found to be true also, as it relates to Israel- [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=183.68s)]
*  Palestine conflict. But over the last, you know, few years talking a lot about Ukraine, then over [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=190.72000000000003s)]
*  the last year, telling a lot about Israel, it's like either either one of two things, either they [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=195.68s)]
*  will give you some BS version of history, which if you know anything about it, you're already like, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=200.08s)]
*  yeah, but you're leaving out so much, you know, information here or you or you're just making a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=204.96s)]
*  claim about history. That's not true. And whatever. It's either that or it's just, you know, what I [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=209.6s)]
*  get on Twitter every day, the laziest, sloppiest. Oh, you're repeating Russian propaganda. Oh, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=216.16s)]
*  you just love terrorism. You just love jihadists. And that's why you're critical of Israel. And [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=221.52s)]
*  it is after a while, almost a little bit flabbergasted. Like you're just like, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  that's all that's all you got. Really? Like who could be persuaded by that? Who would look at [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=232.08s)]
*  that and go like, ah, you know, I did, I did just read Scott's book, but I don't know. This guy says [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=238.08s)]
*  it's all Putin propaganda. So I guess I'm on this guy's side now. We're like, does anybody just watch? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  I just listened to Dave do a debate on Israel, but then I don't know. This guy on the internet [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=249.12s)]
*  said he loves terrorists. So I guess that sort of like, who does this get to work on? It seems so [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=253.04s)]
*  like it's like watching the Kamala Harris campaign. Like, is this really what you guys are going with? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=258.24s)]
*  This is it. Yeah. All right. The same thing for all of Ukraine's PR efforts, or at least the pro [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=262.8s)]
*  war side, uh, all their PR efforts on Twitter this whole time have been to just immediately curse out [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=268.0s)]
*  anyone who disagrees with them at all. When the whole dynamic here is we're the Americans [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=274.32s)]
*  and we're the ones supporting everything that's going on there. You might say like, but Dave, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=280.48s)]
*  don't you know that Putin actually really is bad because of this thing? And that should change [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=287.28s)]
*  your mind to agree with me instead. It's like burning hell Smith from, from the first encounter. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=292.0s)]
*  So like, how is this supposed to, you know, help solidify support for Ukraine when you're telling [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  at least half the American people to absolutely, we should all burn in hell for our refusal to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  support Ukraine burning in hell. Like, I don't know, maybe we just don't. And probably most of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  them are Americans and they just think that's how to win a Twitter fight always is to just come [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=316.32s)]
*  turned up to 11. But I don't know, it doesn't seem to be creating more sympathy from for Ukraine that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  I can tell, you know? Yeah, no, 100%. And you know, I was I got into a Twitter back and forth [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=327.28s)]
*  this morning with a guy who was he was young. He's like 22 years old. And he I guess just graduated [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  college. And he was he was arguing with me over the Jeffrey Sachs Tucker interview, which I want to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=342.55999999999995s)]
*  get your take on in a sec. But so he's arguing with me. And I was trying to as I tend to do, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  especially like if you're 22 years old, typically, I just have a little bit more sympathy for anybody [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=355.2s)]
*  making a bad argument. You know, I man I'm lucky Twitter didn't exist when I was 22. Because I [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=362.56s)]
*  would have been that I would have been the type to try to like win arguments on Twitter too. And I [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=368.24s)]
*  wouldn't have known what I was saying, and it'd be embarrassing in hindsight. So like, I kind of but [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=372.32s)]
*  so I was I was trying to be fairly kind. And he said at one point, he goes, and he might mean this, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=377.2s)]
*  I think genuinely in his 22 year old mind, but he just goes, Why is it that guys like you and and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=383.92s)]
*  Jeffrey Sachs never seemed to get nearly as exercised about Vladimir Putin doing something [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=391.2s)]
*  wrong as you do about when the US does it? What the example he used, he goes, Where's your outrage [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=398.56s)]
*  about the military bases that Vladimir Putin has in Syria or something like that? And, you know, I [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=402.8s)]
*  was trying to almost explain to him because I do think there are there are some number of people [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=409.2s)]
*  who will look at that and go like, Yeah, it does seem like you know, this is you're the blame America [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=416.64s)]
*  first crowd, like you're always on that side. And, and I tried to explain to him, I was like, Well, listen, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  there's an obvious reason for this. It's because we're all Americans. And America is the most [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  powerful government in the history of the world. He said something in the comment, like, Well, why [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=435.36s)]
*  don't you care about, you know, Putin's expansionism, whatever exactly he means by that, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=439.44s)]
*  like, well, because no matter how you slice it, US expansion dwarfs the Russian Federation's [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=444.24s)]
*  expansion. And also, I'm an American. And also, the the forever wars have degraded my country [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=450.64s)]
*  tremendously, like profoundly. And then so I do think sometimes almost that's what gets people [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=459.52s)]
*  tripped up. It's like, Yeah, but everything I hear, it's the social psychology of like, but I just keep [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=464.96s)]
*  hearing you say America bad. But that doesn't make me feel very comfortable. What makes me feel [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=469.52s)]
*  comfortable is you saying other people are bad. Here, these Dirk a Dirk a Stan guys, they're bad, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=475.2s)]
*  you know, like that. So I do think that almost needs to be reminded to people sometimes that it's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=479.76s)]
*  like, this is not you know, I the way I always say it is I go look, everybody, we all accept [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=484.88s)]
*  that the war in Iraq was wrong, and that we were lied into it. And it was a disaster. Everyone [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=490.24s)]
*  accepts that now. That doesn't mean I'm saying I'd rather live under Saddam Hussein in Iraq than I [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=494.88s)]
*  would under George W. Bush in America. That doesn't mean I'm saying I think the people and the music [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=500.64s)]
*  and the culture of Iraq is way better than America's. You know what I'm saying? Like, none of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  this logically follows. It's just that in the conflict of the war in Iraq, the second war in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=511.2s)]
*  Iraq under W. Bush, clearly the US was the bad guys. They were the aggressors, you know, like, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=517.52s)]
*  it's just I think this should be when you have a fully formed brain fairly easy to accept. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=522.88s)]
*  Well, and look, I mean, just because somebody won an election to be the president doesn't mean [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=530.08s)]
*  that they are, you know, the ultimate representative of the American people. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=535.28s)]
*  Like, you know, Bill Clinton is our Uber congressman, and we have all like given our [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=540.72s)]
*  scent to him to be our divine king for a while or something. In fact, no, a guy was a felon who [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=545.04s)]
*  should have been in prison before he was ever sworn into the presidency. You know, I think a [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=551.28s)]
*  lot of us now I've never interacted with a really I should, but I've known her story, you know, back [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=555.52s)]
*  when the rest of the major media was covering it up, only the Wall Street Journal would tell the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=562.48s)]
*  story of Juanita Broderick, who Bill Clinton had savagely raped and punched in the face and bitten [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=566.4s)]
*  on the face while he raped her and then mocked her as he when he left the room. And she told [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  this story so credibly so consistently for she tried to like cover it up and bear she wasn't [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=580.4s)]
*  trying to get publicity out of it. It was only when it was dragged out of her. That's I'll tell [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=585.36s)]
*  as long as I'm ranting about it. She lied to the same grand jury, the Paula Jones civil lawsuit [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=589.2s)]
*  grand jury that Bill Clinton had lied to and said that, no, I don't know what you're talking about, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=595.5200000000001s)]
*  never happened, whatever. But then it went to the federal grand jury under the special prosecutor. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=600.32s)]
*  And Juanita Broderick's son was a lawyer. And he told her mom, you can't lie to a federal grand [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=606.08s)]
*  jury. Civil lawsuit is one thing, federal grand jury doesn't matter what the subject is, doesn't [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=611.36s)]
*  matter that you're the victim and you're talking about somebody else. You cannot lie in any way. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=615.68s)]
*  And so and she couldn't plead the fifth because there was she hadn't done anything wrong to cover [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=622.0s)]
*  up. So she went in there and told the truth. And that was the only time it came out. And then when [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=626.0s)]
*  she sued, she sued for $1. I don't even think it was for $1. It was just for her FBI file. That was [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=629.68s)]
*  all she sued for was her FBI file. And she's known as a tennis nut on Twitter now and is of course, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=634.64s)]
*  a Republican activist now. And you know, Bill Clinton's lawyer goes, any claim that Bill Clinton [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=640.72s)]
*  raped Juanita Broderick in this hotel on this day in 1978 is false. He's like, well, wait, which [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  part are you saying? Because she still was going by her maiden name Hickey at the time. She wasn't [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=658.48s)]
*  Juanita Broderick yet when he savagely bit her on the face while he raped her. Anyway, what I'm [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=664.1600000000001s)]
*  really trying to say here, Dave, is that when Bill Clinton burned Waco, that wasn't America [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=668.88s)]
*  burning Waco. That was Bill Clinton and the national government, the army and the FBI burning Waco is [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=673.04s)]
*  what that was. And when Bill Clinton bombed Bosnia or well and bombed Serbia and, you know, twice in [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=678.32s)]
*  1995, or in 94, 95, and then again in 99, that wasn't America doing that. That was Bill Clinton. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=685.2s)]
*  In fact, he had no authority whatsoever. The Congress didn't authorize that. Never mind declare [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=691.84s)]
*  war. It wasn't even authorized at all. He just does whatever he wants. How is that America? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=696.24s)]
*  And so this is an elementary mistake, right? To say this is blaming America. America is a place [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=702.4s)]
*  with a bunch of people living on top of it. It's, you know, also sort of happens to be the name of [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=709.76s)]
*  the government, but not really. And as libertarians, of course, we like to discriminate and point out [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=715.44s)]
*  the discrepancy there. Of course, the government poses as the country, calls itself the country, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=721.68s)]
*  you know, but that doesn't mean we have to accept that. And as long as it's Bill Clinton, same [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=729.12s)]
*  difference when you're talking about W. Bush or Barack Obama, for that matter, Donald Trump or [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=735.04s)]
*  anybody else up there, Joe Biden, for Christ's sake. Do you think Joe Biden's America? I mean, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=739.5999999999999s)]
*  just because the money interests of Delaware decided they wanted him to be their senator back [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=745.76s)]
*  in 1973 and they kept him there doesn't really mean anything. It doesn't really reflect on the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=751.44s)]
*  rest of us at all. You think, look at Lindsey Graham. I think Lindsey Graham sits in the US [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  Senate, America's house of lords, because that's what the people of the United States of America [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=762.08s)]
*  want? No, somebody has done this to us. We're victims, you know, or innocent bystanders at best [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=766.6400000000001s)]
*  in the selection of Lindsey Graham to be our overlord. And if you stop and think about it, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=776.96s)]
*  if anybody stops and thinks about this stuff for a minute, of course, it's obvious, and all these [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=782.32s)]
*  kinds of claims fall apart. And yeah, like you're saying, and there's a great Noam Chomsky quote, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=786.48s)]
*  and I'm sure you can find some right-winger quotes like this too. Then yeah, of course, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=790.48s)]
*  I'm criticizing my own government. I live here. These are the people that I'm ostensibly responsible [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=793.9200000000001s)]
*  for. At the very least, I got to suffer the consequences of the decisions they make. But then, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=799.12s)]
*  if this is anything like a Democratic-Republican anyway, where the people have sovereignty in any [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=805.04s)]
*  way, then yeah, the grownups are supposed to shout about it when the government is [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=810.88s)]
*  lying and stealing and murdering people and causing terrorists to kamikaze into our towers. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=814.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think in the Noam Chomsky quote that you're referencing, he said something which I [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=821.36s)]
*  always thought was really a really great example, where he was like, imagine if you were like a very [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  high-ranking, like a Soviet, in the Soviet government, in the time that Stalin's committing [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=832.56s)]
*  his worst crimes, and all you can go on about, which is what they used to do, is the human [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=839.28s)]
*  rights violations of the Americans. They used to love to do this under Stalin's Soviet Union. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=846.0799999999999s)]
*  That is the, oh my God, look at, they have segregation in the South, they mistreat black [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=851.5999999999999s)]
*  people, they started this conflict or that conflict. Look how awful the Americans are. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=856.56s)]
*  Can't you just look at that and be like, okay, but wouldn't it be a little bit more valuable [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=862.08s)]
*  use of your time to point out that you are working for Joseph Stalin? You know what I mean? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=867.84s)]
*  And so obviously, it's very convenient that this is where your moral outrage goes to. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=873.12s)]
*  And likewise, it's just, it's so hard for me to sit around, you know, on a panel with some, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=878.88s)]
*  you know, Piers Morgan or someone like that, just going off on all the crimes of Vladimir Putin, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=885.44s)]
*  and how awful he is, and you're kind of like, all right, but, you know, I am a citizen and a [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=890.0s)]
*  non-voluntary taxpayer of the world empire, the most war-hungry country in the world. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=896.88s)]
*  Maybe Israel gives us a run for our money, but they only do it because we give them a money for [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=905.28s)]
*  their run. So- And we only do it because they demand that we do it for our money. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=910.8s)]
*  Okay. But anyway, yeah, it is, it's hard to just be like, obviously, I think as an American, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=916.0799999999999s)]
*  your role would be to criticize the American government first, because they do claim to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  represent us, and they force us to fund their operations. And then on top of that, they're [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=925.84s)]
*  also just the most powerful world empire, the most powerful government that's ever existed. And so [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=931.12s)]
*  they can do a lot more bad than other people could, you know? It's like when people say like, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=936.24s)]
*  oh, you know, Vladimir Putin wants the entire world to be speaking Russian or something like [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=940.32s)]
*  that, which of course he's never said, but you'd go, yeah, well, he doesn't have the power to do [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  that. He doesn't even have the power to take Kiev, evidently. So, okay, let's deal with who actually [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=949.2800000000001s)]
*  has the power and the desire rather than just some abstract claim that they have the desire. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=954.72s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Prolon. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  Forget everything you know about fasting. Prolon by El Nutra is the only patented fasting [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=964.64s)]
*  mimicking diet that combines the benefits of prolonged fasting with a science-backed nutrition [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=970.8s)]
*  plan so you can hit your health and weight loss goals without actually having to give up all that [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=976.24s)]
*  food. I know people, if you're anything like me, you've probably heard about all these intermediate [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=980.8s)]
*  fasting diets. This is what you got to do. If you're like me, you're not going to actually [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=985.1999999999999s)]
*  give up food. So now you can check out Prolon, a revolutionary plant-based nutrition program [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=989.92s)]
*  that nourishes the body while making cells believe that they are fasting. And all of this starts with [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=995.5999999999999s)]
*  Prolon's five-day program, snacks, soups, and beverages, all designed to keep your body in a [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1001.1999999999999s)]
*  fasting state. It's unlike anything you've ever experienced. And right now Prolon is offering [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1006.64s)]
*  part of the problem listeners 15% off their five-day nutrition program. Just go to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1012.0s)]
*  prolonlife.com slash p-o-t-p. That's p-r-o-l-o-n-l-i-f-e dot com slash p-o-t-p for this special offer. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1017.12s)]
*  Prolonlife.com slash p-o-t-p for 15% off their five-day nutrition program. All right, let's get [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1027.76s)]
*  back into the show. Okay, I do, I want to talk to you a little bit about, because there were certain [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1034.4s)]
*  areas of the book that I wanted to get into, but I kind of feel it would be a crime against humanity [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1040.08s)]
*  to have you here and not talk about Syria a bit, because this is obviously is a part, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1045.12s)]
*  a substantial part of the story of your new book, and it's a huge, huge part of the book that you [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1053.12s)]
*  wrote previously to that Enough Already, which I do think I highly recommend everybody. If you [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1060.7199999999998s)]
*  haven't read Enough Already, make sure to buy it and read it. The book is phenomenal. It's every bit [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1066.56s)]
*  as great as provoked. I mean, it's just perfect Hortonian storytelling and giving real history. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1072.32s)]
*  But even if you have read the book, it's worth going back and rereading the Syria chapter just [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1081.36s)]
*  to have a little bit of background, so you're kind of up to speed of like, where were we [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1085.9199999999998s)]
*  right before the Assad regime just fell? But I have not talked to you on air since this happened, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1090.32s)]
*  so what are your thoughts on Assad fleeing the regime change, finally coming to fruition, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1098.96s)]
*  and the Western media celebrating, and even as we played on the last episode here, we were going [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1107.28s)]
*  all over this CNN hoax story about the freed prisoner, but even participating in what is [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1113.76s)]
*  essentially an Al Qaeda propaganda campaign to rehabilitate the image of these Al Qaeda [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1121.76s)]
*  in Iraq fighters who are now in Syria and to kind of, I don't know, celebrate, like isn't this [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1129.12s)]
*  wonderful that Bashar al-Assad has fallen and Al Qaeda is in Damascus? It's pretty wild to watch. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1135.12s)]
*  I know, man. I don't want to make like a bunch of wild predictions because I really just don't know [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1143.2s)]
*  what is going to happen, but I think it's clear that even now, Syria really doesn't exist anymore. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1149.68s)]
*  I don't know what they're going to call whatever part of it Al Qaeda comes to rule, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1157.1200000000001s)]
*  but America is in alliance with the Kurds in the East, in the Northeast with the YPG Kurds, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1161.3600000000001s)]
*  and cannot leave because the Turks would very much like to cleanse and kill and remove them. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1167.04s)]
*  Now, I don't know if Trump has a different relationship with Erdogan that he could prevent [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1175.44s)]
*  with language rather than actual boots on the ground. I'm not so sure, but it's a huge [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1179.76s)]
*  disincentive for the Americans leaving. On the other hand, they have broken the Shiite Crescent. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1186.56s)]
*  Iran can no longer use Syria to transport weapons to Hezbollah and Syria itself, the Alawite regime [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1192.4s)]
*  there that was allied with Iran. So this was the whole point, as David Wormser put it in 1996, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1199.6000000000001s)]
*  why we need to expedite the chaotic collapse to Syria is to break this chain of Shiite power. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1205.76s)]
*  And so that much is done. So why do we need Americans at the Al-Tanf base to sit on that [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1212.56s)]
*  highway to prevent the weapons coming in? I don't know. We need that anymore, even according to [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1217.6s)]
*  the empire's own perspective on that. There's protecting the Kurds and they're keeping the oil [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1223.6s)]
*  and the wheat out of the hands of the Assad regime. I don't know if they're going to turn [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1231.04s)]
*  those resources right over to Al-Qaeda now. Of course, the Israelis are carving out a chunk. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1234.64s)]
*  They've taken Mount Heran and area up to and surrounding it and stopped about, I think they [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1241.5200000000002s)]
*  said 20 kilometers from Damascus. So what's that about 15 miles or something from the capital? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1247.6000000000001s)]
*  They got settlers already coming in and saying, come on, let's colonize this land. It's manifest [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1253.92s)]
*  destiny, baby. Let's do it. Raring to go. It's amazing to see civilians coming in talking about, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1258.56s)]
*  all right, put a stake in the ground right there. This is ours now. Raise this question. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1267.2s)]
*  It's amazing how quick they moved to do that. Netanyahu made a speech the day that Bashar [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1272.48s)]
*  al-Assad fled, or maybe it was the next day, just saying, we're taking this land. We're moving [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1279.9199999999998s)]
*  further. You're like, Oh, you don't have to let this thing cool off for a week. You get to just [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1284.8s)]
*  move in right away. It's like, Oh, I think I'm starting to see why we were supposed to hate [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1288.4s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad so much. There you go. And in fact, you know, Netanyahu and Joe Biden both gave [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1292.32s)]
*  speeches taking credit for Al-Qaeda's victory and saying, yeah, it was because, you know, various [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1297.52s)]
*  parts of their speeches, you know, from Biden's point of view, keeping the Russians bogged down [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1303.28s)]
*  in Ukraine and giving the license to Israel to hit Syria and Iranian and Hezbollah targets [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1308.32s)]
*  in Syria and in Lebanon as much as they please, et cetera, et cetera. And then Netanyahu himself [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1313.9199999999998s)]
*  said, yeah, that's right. You know, we were doing all this damage to their forces in the lead up to [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1319.6s)]
*  this, softening up all these targets for them. And then, and that was the true history of what [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1324.72s)]
*  happened. And then, so who took over? I think it's worth delving into this a bit, Dave, that [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1329.36s)]
*  what we're talking about here for people is, you know, maybe too young because we're, you know, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1334.8000000000002s)]
*  living far in the future now, but you go back 20 years ago when America invaded in Iraq war two, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1339.3600000000001s)]
*  what happened was, as I am often want to detail, America took the Shiite revolution to Baghdad. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1344.96s)]
*  They didn't just kick out Saddam and debathify the government. They de-Sunified it is what they did. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1352.8000000000002s)]
*  They kicked all the Sunnis out of Baghdad in a horrific, you know, sectarian cleansing campaign. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1357.68s)]
*  They gave the capital city and control over the nation state to the Shiite supermajority that [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1363.6s)]
*  had been previously oppressed by the Sunnis. Well, that drove the Sunni population and especially [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1368.4s)]
*  the powerful sheiks who were losing their, you know, status and protection of the national [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1374.0s)]
*  government, pushed them into the arms. Well, first of all, push them to insurgency. And then secondly, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1380.48s)]
*  into the arms of the crazies, the bin Ladenites who came from all around. You had the previous [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1385.2s)]
*  bin Ladenite movement that America had helped to support in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1390.16s)]
*  and who are now coming. And you had, you know, a whole new generation of terrorists come from [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1396.4s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, from Libya, from Syria, Iraq. You know, there's a study, there are a pair of studies [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1402.4s)]
*  in 2005 by the Saudis and the Israelis. So this is a whole new generation of fighters coming. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1407.8400000000001s)]
*  The guys who fought in Afghanistan were essentially the travel agents sending the youth to fight a [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1413.2s)]
*  whole new generation of bin Ladenite fighters to go to Iraq. So this became known as al Qaeda in Iraq. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1418.88s)]
*  And the most prominent leader was a guy named Abu Musab al Zarqawi, who people should know it's very [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1424.96s)]
*  important, had previously told bin Laden, no, I don't want to join your group. I want to kill the [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  king of Jordan, not Americans. So that's my thing. And then also he'd been wanted by Saddam Hussein. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1436.64s)]
*  But the war party made up these lies. Older listeners will remember the story that Saddam [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1443.3600000000001s)]
*  Hussein gave Zarqawi treatment in the hospital and a wooden peg leg after he'd been wounded in [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1449.2s)]
*  Afghanistan. And this was supposedly the connection between Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein. Well, that was [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1455.76s)]
*  a damn lie. And Colin Powell, he knew he was lying when he went to the UN in January of 2003. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1460.72s)]
*  And he said, let me tell you something, there's this guy's Zarqawi and he's al Qaeda. No, he had [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1467.6s)]
*  told bin Laden, no, I don't want to fight you fight with you. I want to do my own thing. So he's still [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1472.9599999999998s)]
*  bin Ladenite in a way by, you know, politics and, and, and, you know, religious fervor and sectarian [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1477.76s)]
*  discrepancy and whatever. But he wasn't part of the movement, which was the claim. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1486.0s)]
*  And then Colin Powell said, and you know what, Dave too, he's in Iraq. And of course, he was being [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1490.8s)]
*  overly broad and general in his statement when he said that knowing that most Americans don't [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1500.56s)]
*  understand that Saddam Hussein only controlled about four or five cities and not at all his [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1506.32s)]
*  own country at the time. And in fact, Zarqawi was safe up in Kurdistan. And I'm finding out [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1510.88s)]
*  more about this, but apparently he was under the explicit protection of the American friend [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1517.68s)]
*  Barzani at the time. I don't know exactly why, but I do know, and it's widely reported by more [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1522.0s)]
*  more sources than you would think. There's so much good journalism. And I'm not sure who to give the [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1529.44s)]
*  most credit to first or what for this, but people can find a ton on this, where the military, and I [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1534.8s)]
*  guess maybe even the CIA wanted to kill this guy before the war, they knew that he was a danger. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1540.5600000000002s)]
*  And George Bush wouldn't let them do it. And they begged over and over and over on all different [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1547.2800000000002s)]
*  occasions for permission to kill him. And Bush wouldn't let them do it because they needed the [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1552.5600000000002s)]
*  talking point. This was the pretend connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. They needed [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1558.24s)]
*  Zarqawi to still be alive. Kind of like having bin Laden and Tora Bora pinned down there and allowing [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1563.92s)]
*  him to escape into Pakistan. You don't get your bonus war without that. That's right. So yeah, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1569.76s)]
*  if America had already killed bin Laden and already killed Zarqawi, then why do we got to [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1575.28s)]
*  kill Saddam? He didn't have anybody to give chemical weapons to anymore. By the way, just [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1578.72s)]
*  for people who might be a little bit younger, but it just it can't be overstated that this was what [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1582.56s)]
*  the entire Iraq war propaganda campaign relied on. Because it wasn't just like, oh my god, Saddam [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1587.6s)]
*  Hussein has these weapons. It was that he has these weapons and he's involved with Al Qaeda. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1593.44s)]
*  He's gonna pass them off to Al Qaeda and then the mushroom cloud will be over Kansas or whatever. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1599.6s)]
*  You know, as ridiculous as that sounds now, immediately after 9-11, this was something that [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1605.36s)]
*  really it was effective propaganda. This moved people to be like, oh, all right, well, we can't [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1610.1599999999999s)]
*  we can't deal with that reality. So we have to go invade. All right, guys, let's take a moment and [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1615.1999999999998s)]
*  thank our sponsor for today's show, which is my patriot supply. Obviously, there's a new administration [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1621.04s)]
*  that will be sworn in soon. But as great as that may be, as excited as you may be, you know that [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1627.36s)]
*  there's still some time left on this administration and things have been wacky for the last few years [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1632.8799999999999s)]
*  and might get wacky again soon. That's why I always have an emergency food supply from my patriot [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1638.32s)]
*  supply. Right now, they're offering $100 off their three-month emergency food kit. It's got 2000 [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1644.7199999999998s)]
*  calories per day for three whole months, plenty to get you through even a prolonged emergency. All [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1651.44s)]
*  of their food kits last up to 25 years in storage. Plus they come in rugged weatherproof buckets. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1657.76s)]
*  You want to have an emergency food kit in your home like I do just so you know if disaster strikes, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1664.24s)]
*  you will be prepared. That's why you got to go to prepare with smith.com to order your three-month [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1670.16s)]
*  emergency food kit now. All right, let's get back into the show. Right. So then when they do invade, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1675.28s)]
*  and as I say, they took the Shiite side in the Civil War, then that pushed the Sunnis to [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1680.96s)]
*  insurgency and into the arms of course of the worst. The bin Ladenite kooks who traveled from [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1685.52s)]
*  all around sprung from Saudi prisons and wherever to fight against the Americans in this horrible [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1690.96s)]
*  war. And so out of the 4500 American soldiers that were killed in the war, and that's soldiers, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1697.1200000000001s)]
*  Marines, sailors, and airmen, and guardsmen, and whatever, is right around 4500. 4000 of those guys [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1702.8s)]
*  died fighting the Sunni insurgency, the worst part of which was Al-Qaeda in Iraq. The other 500 [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1710.24s)]
*  were killed by Iraqi Shia. They always lie and say that Iran killed them, but that's a lie, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1716.32s)]
*  a separate story for another day. But hang on. So these were the guys who killed so many of our [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1721.04s)]
*  guys, the suicide bombers and the roadside bombers of Iraq War II. That was essentially who our guys [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1731.36s)]
*  were fighting there. Then what happened was because they wish they hadn't put the Shiites [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1737.28s)]
*  in power in Baghdad, who after all are allied with Iran, and instead of being compliant with [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1743.36s)]
*  American wishes and telling Hezbollah to stop being friends with Iran and telling Syria to stop [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1747.6s)]
*  being friends with Iran and the rest, instead it just empowered Iran. And so they couldn't [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1752.32s)]
*  reverse the Civil War in Baghdad, and they couldn't launch a regime change war in Tehran, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1759.04s)]
*  because that's just biting off way more than the Pentagon's willing to even try to chew there. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1764.08s)]
*  So what do we got? Well, we do our consolation prize in Damascus. And so that was why they went [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1768.24s)]
*  after Bashar al-Assad in Damascus beginning in 2011 when the Arab Spring broke out. And then it was [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1774.56s)]
*  literally Al-Qaeda in Iraq that crossed the border into Syria and became Al-Qaeda in Iraq in Syria, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1782.56s)]
*  otherwise known as Jabhat al-Nusra. Well, that's the group that we have now. Their leader, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1790.96s)]
*  Jolani, is the guy who was sent by Baghdadi, who was the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, to go and [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1797.28s)]
*  create the Syrian branch. And that's exactly what he went and did. Now in 2013, the Iraqi-dominated [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1802.96s)]
*  faction of Al-Qaeda in Iraq in Syria split away from the Syrian-dominated faction of Al-Qaeda in [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1811.6s)]
*  Iraq and Syria. So Jolani was focused more on the west of the country and focused on fighting [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1818.08s)]
*  Assad and his army in Damascus, whereas Baghdadi decided he would consolidate control over eastern [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1823.52s)]
*  Syria by the spring of 2013 and then one year later rolled into western Iraq. Everybody remembers [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1831.36s)]
*  the iconic picture of the long line of Toyota Helix pickup trucks with their headlights on and [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1838.24s)]
*  their beds full of jihadis rolling into Mosul. And so that was the caliphate. So Bush's war that [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1844.88s)]
*  turned all of western Iraq into sort of lawless, ungoverned, wide-open jihadi stand. And then [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1854.08s)]
*  Obama's war to support them in Syria led them to the rise of the caliphate that had conquered all [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1860.8s)]
*  of eastern Syria and western Iraq. Then Obama had to launch Iraq War III to blow it back up again, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1867.2s)]
*  because having Baghdadi up there like Bin Laden himself on the balcony declaring a dictatorship [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1873.36s)]
*  and all that was too, too much. So that was Iraq War III that Obama started in 14 and Trump finished [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1877.6s)]
*  in his first year in office in 2017. It was basically done by the end of 2017, a little bit [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1883.52s)]
*  into 18. But so Baghdadi was the one who just lines up 1700, well, in fact, he had them laying [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1888.24s)]
*  down on a basketball court and machine guns 1700 Iraqi Air Force cadets. There is other footage of [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1898.88s)]
*  him taking his captives, lining them up, just shooting them in the head and dropping their [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1905.2800000000002s)]
*  bodies in the river. And so it was an absolute horror show when people talk about, they blame [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1909.5200000000002s)]
*  this on Hamas. This is ISIS. This is America's guys, American, Turkey and Saudi's guys in Iraq [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1915.0400000000002s)]
*  are the ones throwing gay men off roofs and all of this just crazy stuff. The great Middle Eastern [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1920.24s)]
*  reporter Patrick Coburn called them sort of like an Islamist Khmer Rouge. That's Pol Pot and his [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1927.68s)]
*  commies that took over Cambodia in the late 70s. And we're known as like the maddest madmen, whoever [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1933.68s)]
*  controlled the state, right? Lord of the Flies on PCP out of control, communist auto genocide, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1939.1200000000001s)]
*  they call it. The government killed two, three million of their own people in the thing. And I [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1945.92s)]
*  don't mean starved them. I mean, murdered them all. Just crazy. And so that's how ISIS was. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1950.48s)]
*  And I say all that, Dave, to say that Jelani has been to finishing school, right? He is now under [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1956.8s)]
*  the public relations tutelage of the United States and Turkey. And it was a few years ago now, three, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1963.68s)]
*  four, five years ago, God, that Martin Smith from, from frontline, we may have even talked about this [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1971.04s)]
*  on your show then. Yeah. Yeah. Martin Smith from frontline tried to, that's PBS documentary, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1979.28s)]
*  foreign policy type thing. You know, serious documentary program did a whole thing to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1985.52s)]
*  rehabilitate the guy. I think we were joking at the time. They must've been listening to my show [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1991.28s)]
*  because I used to say, you see how this guy has a long beard and a turban and looks just like [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1995.04s)]
*  Osama bin Laden and sends fleets of suicide bombers and head choppers out to do suicide [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=1999.12s)]
*  bombings and head choppings. And you see how this other guy wears a three piece suit and shaves his [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2004.24s)]
*  chin every morning and yes, controls a murderous army, but is quite literally a secular dictator [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2008.48s)]
*  who protects all the ethnic and religious minorities in the region. You see how one is [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2014.72s)]
*  different from the other. You see how the beard is one thing and the mustache is another, like you [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2018.72s)]
*  should have been able to tell the difference between Osama and Saddam back in the last war. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2023.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, this is who we're talking about when we're talking about Bashar al-Assad. And yes, a three [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2028.32s)]
*  piece suit is a reason enough to be sure to prefer Bashar al-Assad to Muhammad Abu al-Jalani, right? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2032.24s)]
*  So then what they do, they dressed him up in a three piece suit with the vest and everything. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2039.84s)]
*  And they put him on front line going, look at me, I'm wearing a three piece suit. They didn't [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2044.9599999999998s)]
*  shave his chin, but they put it, he goes, look at me, I'm a sophisticated a Western Democrat now. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2048.72s)]
*  And so his men are not, as far as I know for certain, are not doing head shoppings right now. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2056.24s)]
*  They didn't use suicide bombings in this offensive. They didn't need to. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2064.4s)]
*  They certainly did in the last war, but they have obviously been instructed to dial down the lunacy [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2069.44s)]
*  if you want to hold onto the power. And so, because look in this, the whole root of Al-Qaeda's war [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2078.56s)]
*  against the United States, as long as America's here to blow up their caliphate, ain't no point [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2084.8s)]
*  in building one. There ain't no point in even trying to overthrow your local king if America's [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2090.4s)]
*  going to come and back him up. Or if you succeed, they're going to come and blow up your caliphate [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2094.7200000000003s)]
*  anyway. That's the whole discrepancy in the fight over whether we should target the near enemy or [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2098.4s)]
*  the far enemy. And Zawahiri and Bin Laden and their other leaders of their movement decided, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2103.52s)]
*  we got to target the Americans first. We got to get them angry like a bull to chase after the red [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2110.32s)]
*  scarf into Afghanistan. So we can bog them down, lead them to bankruptcy and force them out the [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2116.8s)]
*  hard way. Unfortunately, Trump and Biden learned their lesson. And well, unfortunately for them, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2122.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, in their narrative, Trump and Biden learned the lesson, got out of Afghanistan before total [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2126.88s)]
*  bankruptcy hit us. So the getting is still good there. And so the, and then, but what happened [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2131.76s)]
*  with Iraq War Three, Dave, they built the caliphate for the forum, but then they blew it up again. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2136.96s)]
*  So if you were like in Al Qaeda doing the near enemy, far enemy argument, looks like the far [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2143.2799999999997s)]
*  enemy argument is winning. As long as we build a caliphate, there's no point in doing it because [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2148.4s)]
*  the Americans will come blow it back up again. Unless we work hand in glove with the US and Turkey [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2152.56s)]
*  and Israel to do it. And we have their full permission and we dial down the head shoppings [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2159.2799999999997s)]
*  and suicide bombings a little bit. And then we get to have what we want because Israel, especially, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2163.8399999999997s)]
*  but also America and Turkey are more than happy to break the back of Shiite power in the region [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2169.76s)]
*  and this Alawite government and its alliance with Iran and Hezbollah. So for them, the price is worth [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2175.6000000000004s)]
*  it to put these guys in power. Now, my thing is this, and first of all, Jelani is, he fought [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2182.8s)]
*  against Americans in Iraq War Two. So that should be the end of the argument, right? This is high [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2189.5200000000004s)]
*  treason for America to support this group at all, regardless of what public relations, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2193.6s)]
*  PowerPoint series that they had to sit through or whatever. They still are loyal to, or they never [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2200.0s)]
*  renounced. People said they renounced Al Qaeda. They just distanced themselves from Al Qaeda. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2209.04s)]
*  They never truly renounced their oath to that movement. And these are the guys who knocked down [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2214.96s)]
*  the towers. Well, I just want to say because I made this point on my last episode, and I should [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2221.6s)]
*  make it with you here too. So I was bringing up your debate with Kathy Young, which I did say is [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2227.92s)]
*  maybe the most one sided debate I've ever seen. There's been some pretty one sided, you had a [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2237.8399999999997s)]
*  pretty one sided one with Bill Kristol too, but it was pretty funny that in the final vote, she only [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2243.12s)]
*  got the guy she came with. That's just pretty hilarious. And she just did a terrible job. She [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2248.16s)]
*  isn't, you know, she's awful. But there was the moment that I think most people remember as kind [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2252.96s)]
*  of the funniest moment of that debate was when she said like, you know, she said something in the [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2258.72s)]
*  portion where you guys get to go back and forth. And she goes like, you know, we don't have to get [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2264.3199999999997s)]
*  into the A's of battalion. We can save that for another time or something. And you were like, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2268.24s)]
*  of course you don't want to get into it. And you asked her how much they hate, they love Adolf [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2271.8399999999997s)]
*  Hitler on a scale of one to 10. And, and then gave her the answer, which was 10. But there was [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2275.52s)]
*  this moment where she, she goes, well, yes, you know, in her Eastern European accent or whatever, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2281.2s)]
*  she goes, yes, they started as a neo-Nazi, as a Nazi organization, but they've evolved from there. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2286.72s)]
*  And it's just, it's amazing that I said, it's almost as if like, I think the example I gave [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2292.08s)]
*  on the show yesterday was like, if imagine talking about like the clue, Cluck's clan this way, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2298.4s)]
*  which by the way, like, I don't know, I haven't heard anything about clue Cluck's [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2303.28s)]
*  clan violence in a long time. I don't really think it's a violent group anymore. But if anyone, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2306.8s)]
*  if you ever told me like, oh, this guy joined the clan and I went, yeah, yeah, yeah, but you're [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2311.6800000000003s)]
*  thinking like the old clan, you'd be like, wait a minute, I'm sorry, dude, you're still joining [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2314.88s)]
*  the clue Cluck's clan. And this is the clan, a pretty awful organization historically. But [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2319.0400000000004s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about Nazis and in this case, Al Qaeda. And yet somehow you can attempt [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2326.2400000000002s)]
*  to do a rehabilitation campaign on these groups. I mean, it is, it's so, it's, you know, one of the [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2332.16s)]
*  things that it really does expose the Warhawks so much because it's like, wait, but these are the [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2338.64s)]
*  groups that you rely on to justify every goddamn war, every war. It's just because, oh, you're weak, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2344.48s)]
*  you're, you, you know, Scott Horton, you're Neville Chamberlain and you just want appeasement, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2352.16s)]
*  but I'm really tough. And I recognize that everyone's a Nazi or everyone's Al Qaeda. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2356.64s)]
*  And yet you will sit here and actually you can't make this shit up that you will run cover and work [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2360.56s)]
*  to rehabilitate the image of both Nazis and Al Qaeda. This is just unbelievable. Yeah. Look, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2366.7999999999997s)]
*  we're still at war in Somalia in the name of Al Qaeda. We stayed in Afghanistan for 20 years [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2373.36s)]
*  in the name of Al Qaeda, launch an aggressive war against Iraq in the name of Al Qaeda, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2380.24s)]
*  support them in Libya, support them in which horrific drone wars, literally, honestly against [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2386.24s)]
*  Al Qaeda in Yemen and Pakistan for a minute before turning right around, finishing the job mostly in [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2392.96s)]
*  Pakistan, but then turning right around and backing Al Qaeda again in Yemen. And I should, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2399.12s)]
*  I should also remind people by the way, again, because I know I do, we do have a lot of young [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2404.24s)]
*  people who listen to the show and I, you know, it's, I'm not a young person anymore. And so I do kind [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2408.08s)]
*  of forget, like this is to me, this is all like very recent history, but I guess, you know, it's, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2412.64s)]
*  it's multiple decades or at least has been going on for, for over 20 years, but the, I cannot stress [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2416.96s)]
*  enough the entire justification for the war in Afghanistan, because if people, again, Scott also [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2423.8399999999997s)]
*  wrote a book about Afghanistan called Fool's errand, also a highly recommend, really great read. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2430.72s)]
*  And really, if you read these three books, by the way, if you get, if there's nothing else and [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2436.3199999999997s)]
*  you're interested in American foreign policy, read Fool's errand enough already and provoked, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2440.32s)]
*  and you are going to have a huge comparative advantage to almost anyone you're talking to [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2444.8s)]
*  this stuff about. But this, okay, in Afghanistan, there, it's by the end of 2001, right? So September [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2448.88s)]
*  11th, the towers come down almost immediately. The special ops mission start in Afghanistan, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2458.48s)]
*  the al Qaeda camps are blasted very, very quickly by the end of the year, there's basically no more [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2465.2s)]
*  like real al Qaeda camps left in Afghanistan. But the justification for why we had to embark on a [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2471.4399999999996s)]
*  regime change war against the Taliban was that, well, listen, which, because if you think about [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2478.0s)]
*  logically, it's kind of like going after a landlord because someone you rented an apartment to [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2483.2799999999997s)]
*  committed a murder. Typically, we don't really blame the landlord for renting the apartment to [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2489.12s)]
*  them, especially as you detail in the book, when afterward, the landlord was willing to talk and [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2494.4s)]
*  negotiate and figure out how to extradite the the wanted party. But the justification was like, nope, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2498.48s)]
*  they rented to al Qaeda once, which means they could rent to them again in the future. And we [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2505.2000000000003s)]
*  simply cannot allow Afghanistan to be a country where al Qaeda could plot the next 9 11. Now, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2510.0s)]
*  forget the fact that lots of 9 11 was not planned in Afghanistan. And it but if you just take this [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2517.84s)]
*  logic, and yet now we can give them Syria, we can hand them their own country. I thought this whole [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2523.12s)]
*  thing was was predicated on the justification that they can't be given a safe haven what like they [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2528.7999999999997s)]
*  can't plan attacks in Syria, or is it because Jelani is saying nice things about Israel or [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2534.72s)]
*  putting on a suit. Now we don't have to have the concern that they could like magically in in Syria, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2540.24s)]
*  they can't plan attacks, but only in Afghanistan, they could. I mean, look, let's pretend that [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2547.6s)]
*  they're right that no, we've tamed Abu Mohammed al Jelani, right? He's the sweetest little al Qaeda [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2553.2s)]
*  guy that you could ever have take over a state for you. If that's really true, then one of his [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2560.0s)]
*  men will soon kill him and replace him. Right? Like, come on, you really just get on the phone [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2566.24s)]
*  and take orders from the Israelis every day, dude. That's what his people are just going to be [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2572.4s)]
*  perfectly happy with that. Now, look, America, Israel and Turkey helped them defeat their [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2577.12s)]
*  immediate enemies. But now what? Like, anybody really thinks everything's going to be fine? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2583.92s)]
*  All the different kinds of Christians, all the Shiites and all the halawites, they're all going [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2590.88s)]
*  to be safe. It's going to be a diverse, multi ethnic, wonderful new Islamist al Qaeda state [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2595.7599999999998s)]
*  there. You know, they've ruled in the Idlib province for the last 10 years, but that's a [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2602.88s)]
*  pretty homogeneous area and a rural area. It's not the same as ruling Aleppo and Hama and Homs and [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2607.76s)]
*  Damascus, right? And in Latakia and all the areas, especially in the western part of the country, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2616.32s)]
*  where you have more Shiites and Christians. I don't know that they're just going to go around [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2623.6800000000003s)]
*  cutting everybody's heads off or refusing to convert and all that, but it's not going to be [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2630.72s)]
*  pretty. At the very least, it's going to be Libya style ongoing strife and civil war for the long [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2635.12s)]
*  term. And again, America is going to stay in the east. And look, I think honestly, if David, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2641.04s)]
*  you know, on the scale of from what Bin Laden on one side to Baghdadi on the other, or [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2650.0s)]
*  Zarqawi is on there somewhere like Jolani is maybe on like the, maybe he's the nicest of those [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2656.48s)]
*  four al Qaeda character, you know, leaders there. Maybe he's the least worst of all of them, but [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2665.84s)]
*  this is a continuum on the far revolutionary, Salafi crazy spectrum of Islamic revolutionary [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2672.16s)]
*  thought, right? I mean, these guys are, they're not Democrats, nothing like it. And so if he is [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2681.84s)]
*  not going to meet out the ultraviolence, he'll probably be replaced by somebody who will. I mean, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2691.92s)]
*  you look at again, just to go back 10 years to ISIS. And again, when Baghdadi broke away, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2697.6800000000003s)]
*  he was by doctrine, specifically meant to be much worse and was like so chauvinist against the [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2703.04s)]
*  Shiites. The only good Shiite is a dead Shiite, this kind of thing. I don't think Jolani is [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2709.68s)]
*  necessarily, maybe he never was that ideological, but he did kill Americans in Fallujah or at least [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2714.7999999999997s)]
*  claim to, you know, fought against Americans in Iraq war two. And, and his men committed all kinds [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2720.96s)]
*  of atrocities during the war 10 years ago. Like I say, all this stuff about softening him up, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2727.04s)]
*  he was already the devil. The fact that Baghdadi was even worse than him. They use that to try to [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2734.0s)]
*  rehabilitate him back then, but it didn't really work because he was obviously so plainly also a [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2741.04s)]
*  bin Ladenite marauder. You know, it's really much more in the meantime, since they've been sort of [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2746.56s)]
*  camped out in the Idlib province that they've really embarked on this further rehabilitation [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2751.68s)]
*  campaign to try to get Western audiences to accept him. Man, you should see the thing in the New [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2757.04s)]
*  York times. This is the most absurd thing. They're like, well, they, they're not chopping [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2762.64s)]
*  people's hands off for smoking cigarettes in public. So that's pretty progressive. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2768.0s)]
*  There you go. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2772.7999999999997s)]

*  about them for many years at this point. They are the best pair of boxer briefs in the world. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2788.32s)]
*  The only pair of underwear that I ever, the only pair of underwear that I ever wear is sheath [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2793.44s)]
*  underwear. And on top of that, they're a longtime sponsor of this show and the company is run by [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2799.6000000000004s)]

*  the show. Yeah, there's there's your there. They're basically pushing DEI. I mean, there you go. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2816.8s)]
*  Haven't even seen the heads chubs off. Well, it is. So Jeffrey Sachs was on Tucker Carlson's [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2822.0800000000004s)]
*  show yesterday. Stealing my thunder. Stealing it certainly certainly a little bit, but he it seems [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2830.0s)]
*  to be somewhere, you know, not quite maybe not quite the outrage storm that our buddy Darrell [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2836.0s)]
*  created by daring to question whether the biggest bloodbath in human history was a perfectly great [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2844.16s)]
*  thing. And everybody on our side did everything right, you know. But there so one of the things [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2849.36s)]
*  Jeffrey Sachs said, which I have, I have seen characterized on on Twitter as vile anti semitism. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2855.28s)]
*  Jeffrey Sachs clearly hates Jewish people. I know it's too it's all just too ridiculous. But he said, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2863.6s)]
*  and I will say, you know, when he said it, I did, obviously, I loved it. But I was like, Oh, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2870.7999999999997s)]
*  he really just said that. But he just goes, he goes, you know, the US decided to outsource [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2877.3599999999997s)]
*  their foreign policy to Israel. And it's been another disaster for not just the United States [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2884.48s)]
*  of America, but every single where that this conflict has touched. And then he went into the [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2889.68s)]
*  long history of the, you know, the last, what is it 13 years in Syria, right? 13? I'm not gonna [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2893.52s)]
*  map. Yeah, he went back to the clean break. This is all about what Netanyahu wanted ever since the [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2900.72s)]
*  mid 1990s. By the way, what a kind of wild admission. I don't know if it's an admission [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2906.0s)]
*  exactly. Because you when you were debating General Wesley Clark, it seemed like he was, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2913.04s)]
*  I remember I said to you on the phone afterward, it seemed like you were debating like a screen [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2919.6s)]
*  door in the wind. Like, it's just kind of like, would you hold still so I can kick you open? Like, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2924.16s)]
*  where are you even going here? But he did at one point just say, you know, you brought up the fact [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2928.64s)]
*  that he's most famous for this seven countries in five years quote, and hey, remember that? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2933.04s)]
*  And he goes, Oh, no, no, no. This goes back to the early 90s. He's like, No, no, no, no, Wolfowitz [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2938.16s)]
*  had this plan long before that. So I don't exactly even myself know where the origin of the kind of [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2943.92s)]
*  clean break seven countries in five years strategy came from. However, it's been here for quite a [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2950.32s)]
*  long time. And it's anyway, there's really something to kind of see. But there is like a kind of [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2955.6s)]
*  fundamental dynamic here, where obviously, I understand where people don't like the way it [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2965.04s)]
*  sounds when you say, Hey, we outsource our foreign policy to Israel. And the response is, Oh, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2971.2s)]
*  you're blaming the Jews or something like that. Even though it's not this is not a comment on [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2975.6s)]
*  Barry, the dentist on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. This is a comment on the neo [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2980.8799999999997s)]
*  conservatives and the Likud party. That's fairly specific. But there's this great quote, which you [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2985.68s)]
*  have, you have in it's in enough already. I'm blanking on the name of the guy and his position. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=2993.3599999999997s)]
*  But the Israeli it's on video, if anybody, we played it before on the show. But where the and [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3000.32s)]
*  I'm sure you'll remember this because you have it in your book, but where the Israeli guy was [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3005.76s)]
*  saying that they will treat wounded Al Qaeda guys, but they won't treat wounded Hezbollah fighters. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3009.6800000000003s)]
*  Do you remember who who was it was? It was frame Halevi. Yeah, interview with Nnedi Hassan on Al [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3016.88s)]
*  Zir. Yes. And so he's basically saying that they were talking about how like on the battlefield, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3025.12s)]
*  if Al Qaeda members are wounded, they will give them medical attention. Hezbollah, on the other [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3031.12s)]
*  hand, they will not. And he goes, Well, why not? He goes, Well, Al Qaeda are not our enemies. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3036.48s)]
*  Hezbollah is our enemy. We're involved in a conflict with Hezbollah, but not with Al Qaeda. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3040.7999999999997s)]
*  And then he's kind of like, Whoa, I mean, but that's crazy, because they're our enemies. And [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3046.0s)]
*  the whole reason we're in this war on terrorism is because of that. But I will say to almost perhaps [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3049.6s)]
*  if Israel was not just a fat welfare mom for the United States of America, like if they were [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3057.12s)]
*  self sufficient, I could almost accept that. They go, Hey, I think it's kind of listen, after all, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3064.24s)]
*  we're not at least in that clip. He's talking about giving medical treatment. I'm kind of of the [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3069.7599999999998s)]
*  belief that you give medical treatment to everybody, even horrific mass murderers, like I don't, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3073.8399999999997s)]
*  you know what I mean? Like, I think if you're serving a life sentence in prison, we still give [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3078.88s)]
*  you medical treatment, because that's kind of the way civilized people do things. Regardless, it's [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3082.7200000000003s)]
*  like, I think to get at the point that Jeffrey Sachs was making, it's just like, Why is it that [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3087.6s)]
*  Israel is allowed to have that opinion? And yet, then why can't we say the exact same thing? And go, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3093.28s)]
*  Okay, but our enemy is Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is the enemy of the American people. And Hezbollah is not. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3099.12s)]
*  And Bashar al-Assad is not. So I think like what Jeffrey Sachs is, or what is some evidence to [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3106.8s)]
*  point that his assertion is correct, is that we are somehow, through many different forces, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3113.52s)]
*  in a political situation, where we are not allowed to think in our own national interest in the way [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3121.92s)]
*  that Israel is about these conflicts. Like they can sit there and just say, Hey, look, we got two [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3127.6800000000003s)]
*  guys here, right? We have Bashar al-Assad, and we have Al Qaeda. Well, Bashar al-Assad's our enemy, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3132.64s)]
*  because he allows the transfer of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah. But Al Qaeda is not our enemy. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3137.44s)]
*  Why on earth can't the Americans be allowed to do the same thing? And just say, Well, quite the [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3143.3599999999997s)]
*  opposite for us. For us, Bashar al-Assad never hit any towers in Manhattan, and neither did Hezbollah. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3148.96s)]
*  And that's like, we're out of southern Lebanon. Yeah, look, that's all we're talking about is [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3154.64s)]
*  America's interests and Israel's interests are separate and different. And you can't get more [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3159.92s)]
*  blatant than what you're talking about right here. Their enemies are the Shiites. Ours are the Sunnis. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3164.0s)]
*  And the radical vanguard edge of America's own Sunni terrorist mercenary army, that in fact, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3169.92s)]
*  if we would just tell our allies to stop backing them, we'd probably dry up and blow away mostly. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3177.2000000000003s)]
*  If America and our friends would quit taking their side in these things, and, you know, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3182.96s)]
*  doing things that also motivate people to turn against us. But it wasn't, as you say, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3187.84s)]
*  quite correctly, it was not Iran or Syria's Assad, Baathist regime or Hezbollah in Lebanon [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3195.6000000000004s)]
*  that knocked our towers down. That was the bin Ladenites that did that. And then so what [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3203.44s)]
*  do the neoconservatives do? Was the same thing they've been doing for 25 years, Dave, Michael [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3207.2000000000003s)]
*  LeDin would go, yeah, dude, we have to take on the terror masters in Tehran. Well, what do you mean, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3211.6s)]
*  the terror masters? They go, well, don't you know Iran is the world's greatest state sponsor of [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3219.44s)]
*  terrorism? Hmm, that's a little vague. How come you didn't say they're the world's greatest state [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3227.6s)]
*  sponsor of Al Qaeda? Oh, it's because Al Qaeda suicide bombs Iranian Shiites to death, chops [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3233.7599999999998s)]
*  their heads off. Oh, I get it. They're the enemies of our enemies. So instead you come up with this [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3240.48s)]
*  crap about terror masters and greatest state sponsor of something or other when what you're [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3246.48s)]
*  really talking about is they back Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Okay. Well, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3254.0s)]
*  then back in Hamas makes them equally as guilty as Benjamin Netanyahu. So I don't want to hear [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3260.16s)]
*  another word about that. And backing Hezbollah, it wasn't even Hezbollah. It was sort of proto [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3264.56s)]
*  pre-Hezbollah that blew up the American Marine barracks in 1983, where Reagan acknowledged he [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3270.7999999999997s)]
*  shouldn't have put them in the first place. But also that same day, Israel knew what was going to [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3278.64s)]
*  happen and refused to warn their American best friends and benefactors in the whole world that [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3283.6s)]
*  it was going to happen. And anyone can read this in the book by way of deception by Victor Ostrovsky. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3288.4s)]
*  That's named after the way that the Israelis make you think everything that you think about [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3294.24s)]
*  Israel is by lying to you because they're liars because they have to be because they're guilty [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3298.0s)]
*  of theft and mass murder all the time. And so they have to lie to make themselves look better. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3303.04s)]
*  So by way of deception is the name of the book. It's by a former Mossad agent named Victor [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3308.24s)]
*  Ostrovsky. And he talks about how the Mossad guys said to each other, he was there. And they said, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3312.24s)]
*  that's what the Americans get for sticking their nose into our business in Lebanon. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3317.8399999999997s)]
*  Let them get bombed as American Marines were killed 240 of them. So we still have to hate [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3321.52s)]
*  Hezbollah for that. Then I still get to hate Israel for that. They might as well have helped [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3326.56s)]
*  Hezbollah do it then. Same damn difference. What would the Israelis say if America knew that [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3331.44s)]
*  somebody's going to truck bomb and kill 241 of their IDF? And when we kept that secret from them, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3336.48s)]
*  they do a regime change in Washington, D.C. and put the other party in power at the next election, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3342.72s)]
*  is what they would do. They start an extra war and make sure we lose it just to rub our nose in [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3347.68s)]
*  it. If we dare do that to them. So yeah, the Shiites didn't do anything else. You know what? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3354.16s)]
*  Zabitna Brzezinski was the national security advisor at the time of the Iranian revolution. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3362.64s)]
*  And so if anyone was humiliated by the rise of the Ayatollah, the seizing of the hostages and all of [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3368.48s)]
*  that, it was him. He's the one who helped advise Carter that you better announce the Carter doctrine [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3374.64s)]
*  to save face after this absolute humiliation, his personal humiliation. But hey, by 1993, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3379.8399999999997s)]
*  he was taking money from, I think it was Conoco Phillips, to advise that America ought to build [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3388.56s)]
*  a pipeline from Azerbaijan, from Baku, Azerbaijan, where they're tapping into the Caspian Basin oil [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3394.3199999999997s)]
*  and ship it across Iran to a terminal in the Persian Gulf. And this would be a good way [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3402.7999999999997s)]
*  to begin to bring Iran back in from the cold and normalize relations with Iran, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3410.3199999999997s)]
*  said Zabitna Brzezinski. And who vetoed it, Dave? Israel vetoed it. Bill Clinton stupidly said [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3414.72s)]
*  that he wanted to bring Saddam Hussein back in from the cold and normalize relations with Iraq. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3424.96s)]
*  And I'm not saying that was the wrong thing to do. I'm saying he was stupid to say that out loud, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3430.08s)]
*  because as soon as he said that out loud, the Israelis and the Kuwaitis began mobilizing to [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3434.08s)]
*  prevent it. And everyone's familiar with the fake, alleged assassination attempt against George H.W. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3438.3199999999997s)]
*  Bush in Kuwait by truck bomb. Everyone's heard that a million times. George Bush Jr. saying, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3447.12s)]
*  oh, he tried to kill my dad and all this stuff. Never happened. The whole thing was fake. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3451.68s)]
*  Seymour Hersh debunked it in the New Yorker magazine. It was just a whiskey smuggling ring. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3455.7599999999998s)]
*  In fact, if you search my name in whiskey smuggling ring and assassination of Bush [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3460.08s)]
*  Sr., something or other like that on Twitter, I bet you can find where I posted screenshots [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3464.0s)]
*  of that entire New Yorker article from the archives for you there. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3467.36s)]
*  Well, in George W. Bush's defense, it not being true doesn't mean he didn't believe it was true. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3470.0s)]
*  Oh, that's true. Yeah, I think he had no idea. I'm sure he doesn't. He has no idea who Seymour [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3474.88s)]
*  Hersh even is. But so that was fake. But when it came out, see, Clinton had been under pressure. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3479.04s)]
*  First, you know, like 100 days, early 93, and not long after the Waco massacre, and Martin [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3486.56s)]
*  Indick, who had been an advisor to Yitzhak Shamir from the Likud party, the former prime minister [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3493.7599999999998s)]
*  of Israel. Former terrorist before that. Yeah, yeah. Or maybe not just before that. But yes, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3499.68s)]
*  during that. Yeah. And during that too, probably. Yeah. And the guy who intervened to help get Bush [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3507.2s)]
*  senior unseated for Bill Clinton in the first place. But Indick had a policy called dual [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3512.72s)]
*  containment, and Bill Clinton was holding off. Bill Clinton still thought that he could try to [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3519.4399999999996s)]
*  bring Saddam Hussein back in from the cold to balance against Iran, because after all, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3523.9199999999996s)]
*  he used to work for Ronald Reagan until he crossed H.W. Bush and got smacked down. But that doesn't [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3528.48s)]
*  mean that we have to keep him on the outs forever. But the Israelis said, yes, you do. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3534.24s)]
*  And Martin Indick, on Israel's behalf, said, listen, America, partially at Israel's behest, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3539.9199999999996s)]
*  beat up Iraq's army so badly in Iraq War One, in Desert Storm in 91, that now Saddam is not [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3548.7999999999997s)]
*  powerful enough to balance against Iran. So now America must stay in Saudi Arabia to balance [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3555.7599999999998s)]
*  against Iran and Iraq. And that's the dual containment policy. And that then became the [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3563.04s)]
*  number one motive for Reagan and Bush and Bill Clinton's mercenaries, Al Qaeda, to turn against [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3569.12s)]
*  the United States of America, staying in Saudi Arabia to bomb and blockade Iraq. After the failed [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3574.56s)]
*  Shiite uprising of the Bush senior years, and then the status quo that Bill Clinton inherited, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3583.92s)]
*  he was trying to resolve it. Instead, he stayed. He inaugurated the do after the fake assassination [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3589.52s)]
*  attempt against Bush senior. Martin Indick gave a speech where at the Washington Institute for [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3594.72s)]
*  Near East Policy, the spin off of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, inaugurating the [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3599.84s)]
*  dual containment policy that got our towers knocked down about as simple as that. And it was all for [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3605.2s)]
*  Israel. The other the number two thing on Al Qaeda's list for motives to attack the United States [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3610.96s)]
*  was support for Israel and their mass murders of women and children in Palestine and Lebanon. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3616.16s)]
*  So number one on the list was an American policy in Saudi Arabia and Iraq that was insisted upon [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3621.04s)]
*  by Israel and Iran that was insisted upon by Israel. And then the second thing was just [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3626.16s)]
*  supporting Israel itself literally, and not just being a nice Jewish boy minding his own business, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3631.2s)]
*  but constantly murdering people and stealing people's property. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3636.48s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Qaliyah. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3640.0s)]
*  As we age, everyone accumulates senescent cells in their bodies. Senescent cells cause symptoms [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3644.96s)]
*  of aging such as aches and discomforts, slow workout recoveries, sluggish mental and physical [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3650.2400000000002s)]
*  energy associated with that middle age feeling. Also known as zombie cells. These are old worn [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3655.92s)]
*  out and not serving useful functions for our health anymore. But they're taking up space and [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3662.16s)]
*  nutrients from our healthy cells. Much like pruning the yellowing and dead leaves of a plant, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3667.2s)]
*  Qaliyah senolytic removes those worn out senescent cells to allow the rest of them to thrive in the [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3672.88s)]

*  Yeah, it seems like that has the pesky little habit of pissing a lot of people off when you [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3748.56s)]
*  do that. You know, as I've mentioned a bunch on the show, but it is the claim that Iran [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3754.56s)]
*  is the global leader in sponsoring terrorism is one that, so you hear this a lot. I remember, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3762.72s)]
*  I mean, Karl Rove used to go on Fox News and say this all the time. Iran is the number one [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3771.68s)]
*  supporter of terrorism. And you know that when he was saying it, he was just counting on everybody's [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3777.9199999999996s)]
*  Fox News watching Dad to not know, just counting on you to not know the difference between a Sunni [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3784.64s)]
*  and a Shiite and not even ever ask that question. And obviously what you're supposed to think of in [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3791.6s)]
*  your head is 9-11, that you're supposed to think like, oh, these guys are funding the terrorists. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3796.3199999999997s)]
*  Ben Dominic, I debated him on this topic, Megan McCain's husband there, and he made this claim. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3802.32s)]
*  And I just followed it up by asking what evidence there is of that. You're like, where's the point [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3808.0s)]
*  to this to me? Like, actually show me where there's like, I'm not even saying it's not, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3814.4s)]
*  if you want to call Hezbollah and Hamas terrorist organizations, okay, you could say, sure, fine, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3818.4s)]
*  I'm not going to argue with you on that. But like, show me the actual study that said, like, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3824.32s)]
*  went over like US money that goes toward terrorism, Saudi money that goes toward terrorism, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3828.8s)]
*  like even forget the shins, the shirts versus the skins or whatever, like where, and he had nothing. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3834.32s)]
*  He was just like, well, this has been reported and lots of, and you're like, oh, okay, anyway, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3839.52s)]
*  I'm just, it's just this claim that gets made. But of course I do think that the ultimate point for [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3843.52s)]
*  for libertarian non-interventionists like us is like, it's what Noam Chomsky said back in the day, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3849.44s)]
*  which I always thought was, he said it very well, that he goes, what is really the definition of [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3857.52s)]
*  terrorism? Well, it's terrorism when they do it. It's counter terrorism when we do it. And that [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3862.32s)]
*  essentially is, you know, like, if you want to, like, trying to make some type of moral distinction [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3868.24s)]
*  between the evils of terrorism, and what Israel's doing to Gaza right now is the only difference is [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3873.84s)]
*  that they're doing it from a government and one of the governments that is allied with our government. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3881.12s)]
*  That's the essential difference there. I mean, it's like, I, you know, it's, what is even like [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3887.12s)]
*  the Webster's definition of terrorism, like acts of violence to encourage a political change or [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3893.04s)]
*  something like that? And nope. Okay, that seems to pretty clearly fit the definition. So, you know, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3899.92s)]
*  the, again, I don't think it's not like blame America first here. I think what you really are [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3905.92s)]
*  arguing in this book, and I think what is kind of the through line throughout all of your work, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3913.04s)]
*  and throughout all of my commentary as well, is that it's just like, look, if we're going to be [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3918.32s)]
*  in the business of morally condemning people, fine. But let's just have one standard and apply it to [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3923.84s)]
*  everybody. You know, this is what the Zionists say, oh, you're, you're, what's the term? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3930.0s)]
*  Moral equivalence. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3935.84s)]
*  Moral equivalency. First of all, it goes like- [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3937.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Moral equivalent. That's exactly what I'm saying, dude. You're morally equivalent [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3940.08s)]
*  to a bunch of suicide bombing head chopping scum. That's what I meant to say. You heard me. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3943.84s)]
*  Well, it's also like, it's like, well, I didn't, I mean, I never said it was equivalent. I think [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3950.48s)]
*  it's actually much worse. Like, I don't know. Like, my whole point is that it's not equivalent, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3954.88s)]
*  actually, that you've killed far more people, but it's wrong for the same reasons. You know, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3960.32s)]
*  and so yeah, that's the, it's, it's funny because I've heard people even use this, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3965.44s)]
*  this line of attack with the same moral equivalency. And then sometimes they'll, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3971.04s)]
*  they'll, uh, accuse me of moral relativism. And I'm like, I really don't think you understand what [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3974.1600000000003s)]
*  these terms mean. What I'm saying is the opposite of moral relativism. It is you who is imply, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3980.0s)]
*  who is embracing this moral relativism as if it's somehow different in character. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3986.6400000000003s)]
*  I've always been fascinated by that. Right-wingers have always done this since the 1990s. This was [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3991.92s)]
*  the thing I used to listen to them say on talk radio all the time was the liberals, they insist [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=3996.08s)]
*  on moral relativism about everything. And then as soon as someone says Israel, they go, you claim [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4002.48s)]
*  there's moral equivalence. And that if somebody on this side does the exact same thing as somebody [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4009.36s)]
*  on that side, then somehow it's the same thing. That's crazy. Huh? It's a very sane people. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4015.04s)]
*  Even sometimes in the very same conversation. You know, and a lot of these objections, they [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4021.6s)]
*  almost roll into each other. Cause the other one that I get all the time is when people will say [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4028.3199999999997s)]
*  this, what about ism thing. Like if, if someone brings up the crimes of Vladimir Putin and you [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4032.64s)]
*  bring up the crimes of the U S government, oh, that's what about ism or something like that. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4037.6s)]
*  But there is, it's like the example I try to give, it's like, Hey, so, so me and you are [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4041.7599999999998s)]
*  libertarians, right? So we hate taxes. We oppose taxes. Now let's just say hypothetically, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4046.16s)]
*  every country in the world had a 90% tax rate, except one country that had a 10% tax rate. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4052.8799999999997s)]
*  And then somebody was like criticizing that country and going, well, don't you hate them, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4059.7599999999998s)]
*  Dave? You're against taxes and they have a 10% tax rate here. And I go, well, I mean, yeah, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4062.96s)]
*  but everyone else has a 90 and they only have 10. So that, and they'd go, what about ism? And you're [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4067.68s)]
*  like, well, no, I mean, I'm just saying, put this into context here. That's all. So again, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4072.72s)]
*  I think a lot of the criticisms, like even when Pierce Morgan or, or whatever Zionist or someone [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4078.3999999999996s)]
*  will say, you know, Hey, look at all the crimes of Vladimir Putin. He's arrested journalists. He's [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4083.52s)]
*  done this. He's killed innocent people. He's an authoritarian. Look at these awful crimes that [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4088.56s)]
*  come out. It's like, yeah, we're not really arguing with that. We agree that stuff's all wrong. The, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4093.8399999999997s)]
*  the question is like, it's more like, but why are you being a moral relativist about this? Like why, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4099.52s)]
*  if we're going to, if the first thing that comes to your mind, when you think of Vladimir Putin is [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4105.040000000001s)]
*  all the worst things he's ever done, fair. Okay. Why does that not also apply to George W. Bush? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4109.76s)]
*  Why does that not also apply to Barack Obama? Why is it when they come up, the first thing I [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4116.400000000001s)]
*  shouldn't bring up is the hundreds of thousands, two millions of innocent people who got slaughtered [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4121.120000000001s)]
*  directly because of their foreign policy. What, let's just have one standard and apply it to [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4126.88s)]
*  everybody. That seems reasonable to me. Yep. And look, there must be, I'm not thinking of great [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4133.12s)]
*  examples, but there must be examples of what about ism where that's a real thing where it's [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4139.12s)]
*  essentially just a cheap attempt to change the subject, right? Where it's like refusing to [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4142.8s)]
*  allow somebody to score their point in the argument by changing the subject to something [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4148.4800000000005s)]
*  else that somebody else did when really that's sort of a red herring and doesn't really affect [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4153.2s)]
*  the argument itself where you can make a real good argument that America's in no position [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4158.08s)]
*  to enforce the world law when America does nothing but break it and continue to set precedents by [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4164.72s)]
*  which other countries break it too. I mean, it's, I think a really highly important thing, not just [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4171.44s)]
*  a symbolic thing, but an important thing that when Vladimir Putin declared war in Ukraine, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4178.72s)]
*  he invoked W. Bush's, first of all, Bill Clinton's separation of Kosovo from Serbia in the name of an [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4184.400000000001s)]
*  ethnic conflict there. He invoked W. Bush's claims of weapons of mass destruction since Zalensky had [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4191.6s)]
*  talked about canceling the Budapest memorandum. And then he invoked Barack Obama in Libya. And so, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4196.96s)]
*  oh, in fact, it turns out I have a responsibility to protect. I have to intervene even to violate [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4204.16s)]
*  national government sovereign borders in order to prevent a humanitarian crisis from breaking out [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4211.599999999999s)]
*  against this helpless minority, whatever. And so he was invoking three different presidents in a row [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4216.88s)]
*  breaking the law to do whatever they wanted for what they saw as America or more aptly, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4224.32s)]
*  Israel's national interests. And then he said, okay, well, I guess I can do exactly the same [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4230.16s)]
*  as you. And it was the precedent used to be the law supposedly said, you have to have an agreement [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4237.44s)]
*  on the UN Security Council to start a war, because all the victors of World War Two sit there. And [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4244.0s)]
*  the fact that China and Russia are on it means it's a balance against the West. And the fact that [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4249.12s)]
*  Britain, France, and the United States are on it is a balance against the East, that they don't [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4255.599999999999s)]
*  get to just start wars and do whatever they want without some kind of consensus being made, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4259.6s)]
*  but this is what has to happen. And so that was why Bill Clinton just went around it in Serbia, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4264.160000000001s)]
*  and why Bush just went around it in Iraq, and why Obama just went, well, he didn't go 100% around [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4269.04s)]
*  it in Libya. He just lied to the Russians to get them to abstain and promised it was just a no fly [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4274.400000000001s)]
*  zone and then launched a full scale nine month long regime change war. It's almost like the [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4279.360000000001s)]
*  international rules based order is just a smokescreen for American Empire. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4284.64s)]
*  That's right. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4290.400000000001s)]
*  But that's it. Okay, listen, I got to wrap there. Of course, once again, I did not talk to you about [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4291.280000000001s)]
*  any of the things that I planned and wanted to talk to you about. So we'll do this again soon. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4296.0s)]
*  No, it's not your fault. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4301.120000000001s)]
*  Once I start talking about the clean break, you know how I am. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4301.52s)]
*  Well, listen, you guys, you got to pick up a copy of provoked. Provokedbook.com is the site [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4305.200000000001s)]
*  that you can go to to get it. Is that the best place to get it? Or does it help you more people [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4311.2s)]
*  who work from Amazon? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4315.28s)]
*  Yeah, that'll forge on to my website. And then yeah, that link will give me an extra little boost [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4316.639999999999s)]
*  there. If you buy it from the link at scotthorton.org there. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4320.72s)]
*  And of course, antiwar.com, the libertarianinstitute.org. Where else can people go to [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4324.16s)]
*  follow your great work? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4331.36s)]
*  Well, I'm on all the podcatchers and video sites, the Scott Horton Show, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4333.2s)]

*  All right, dude, brother, always great talking to you, man. And I, I, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4340.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm going to say I promise next time we'll set up another one in the next week or so. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4345.4400000000005s)]
*  I promise we're going to talk shock therapy and color coded revolutions, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4349.92s)]
*  barring, barring the world not doing something crazy in between now and then when I have to [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4353.52s)]
*  just talk to you about that. So hopefully everyone can just stay a little bit stable in these foreign [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4359.360000000001s)]
*  conflicts that we can get into the history of those two things. Because I really want to talk [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4364.400000000001s)]
*  about that. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4367.68s)]
*  That never works by the way where the world holds on for you. So you can catch up real quick. Yeah. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4368.48s)]
*  Welcome to my world. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4373.599999999999s)]
*  All right. Well, thank you, Scott. And thank you to everybody for listening. Catch you next time. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtfRMulpyc&t=4375.92s)]
