# The New Tech Stack for Virtual-First Care
**a16z Bio:** [January 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U)
*  We're coming off of what was a record breaking year for digital health in terms of the number [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=0.0s)]
*  of companies that got started and funded and the levels of growth that they achieved on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  the patient utilization and revenue side. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=24.84s)]
*  And it feels like we're truly entering into a new golden era for health care technology. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=27.32s)]
*  After years of health care startups primarily focusing on selling solutions to industry incumbents, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=32.44s)]
*  largely because they were the only viable buyer base out there, there has recently been [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=37.32s)]
*  an explosion of full stack digital health companies that take the form of a virtual [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=41.04s)]
*  clinic and compete directly for patients against traditional providers. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  These digital health companies require similar backend infrastructure to traditional providers, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=50.56s)]
*  but the available quote unquote health care IT systems out there just completely failed [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=54.96s)]
*  to meet the mark. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=58.96s)]
*  Not only do these health care IT systems have terrible user experience, but they were also [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=60.46s)]
*  built during a time when fee for service was the dominant way of doing business, when interoperability [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=64.62s)]
*  wasn't yet a thing, and when patients were not considered to be a primary end user of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=69.84s)]
*  these products. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=74.44s)]
*  Obviously, everything has changed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=75.44s)]
*  As such, of the hundreds of digital health companies that we have met with in the last [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  18 months, we've found that the majority of them have chosen to build their entire [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=81.32s)]
*  tech stack from the ground up, while the rest have licensed off the shelf systems and spent [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=86.08s)]
*  lots of time and money to customize them to get them to do what they ultimately need them [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  to do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=95.78s)]
*  The true promise of digital health is the possibility of delivering high quality care [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  at a fraction of the cost and at dramatically higher scale than their historical incumbents. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=102.46s)]
*  And the way by which we achieve that is by using modern technology and AI to do what [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=108.2s)]
*  historically has been done through human labor or these overpriced IT products that actually [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=112.64s)]
*  decrease productivity rather than enhance it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=117.68s)]
*  A risk to this promise is that every digital health company ends up reinvesting all of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=120.84s)]
*  their cost savings into the development of the same operating system components over [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  and over again from scratch across their separate walled gardens. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=129.24s)]
*  We are now at a tipping point where the digital health market is large enough and growing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=134.16s)]
*  quickly enough to drive demand for companies that serve as the new tech stack for virtual [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=138.14s)]
*  first care. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=143.2s)]
*  In the same way that companies like Plaid, Stripe and AWS abstracted out entire layers [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=144.62s)]
*  of infrastructure and dramatically reduced the cost and time to stand up a new tech business, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=150.06s)]
*  these health tech companies are now allowing digital health startups to accelerate their [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=155.92s)]
*  time to market and really focus on the higher order elements of their products and services [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  to deliver game changing care to patients. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=164.0s)]
*  So what are the components of the new tech stack for virtual care? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  Well the categories in which we see the early emergence of players that are dedicated to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  selling to the digital health market and getting to promising levels of scale include clinical [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  operations. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=179.56s)]
*  These are companies that relate to things like care coordination, virtual provider networks [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  and ancillary services like labs, pharmacy and home health. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=185.04s)]
*  Another category is back office administration and this is companies that serve the revenue [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=188.98s)]
*  cycle, credentialing and supply chain type use cases. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=192.88s)]
*  And then we have front office administration which is companies that serve customer engagement, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=196.36s)]
*  sketch and reg and patient acquisition type capabilities. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=201.36s)]
*  Importantly digital health companies are generally at the tip of the spear of much of the business [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=206.6s)]
*  model evolution that is occurring across healthcare which has really driven the need for novel [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=210.28s)]
*  capabilities across all three aforementioned areas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  These capabilities really need to support things like risk bearing models, recurring [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=218.24s)]
*  revenue streams, cash pay and membership based approaches versus just the straight fee for [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=221.72s)]
*  service revenue models of days past. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=227.4s)]
*  For instance companies like Cerebre allow companies to take on sophisticated actuarial [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=230.08s)]
*  capabilities as a service such that they can bear risk and be at the top of their game [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=235.12s)]
*  with respect to risk analytics and underwriting. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Another interesting thing is that these are not necessarily just software based companies. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=243.28s)]
*  Several health tech companies offer full stack operational service with both online and offline [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  aspects. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=251.66s)]
*  For instance a platform like Sitka manages essentially its own virtual multi-specialty [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  medical group through which e-consults can be facilitated for their users and Work Path [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=257.02s)]
*  actually sends physical phlebotomists into people's homes to conduct decentralized sample [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=261.98s)]
*  collection for lab test fulfillment. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=266.86s)]
*  Today we see digital health companies contracting with multiple vendors across these categories [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=269.5s)]
*  sometimes even creating redundancy through multiple relationships. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  However in the future we do anticipate that the winners that emerge will very rapidly [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  expand their service area to capture more value both within a given category and even [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=282.06s)]
*  across categories like how True Pill has expanded beyond pharmacy which is where they started [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=287.18s)]
*  into telehealth and lab services in recent months. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=292.86s)]
*  The companies that emerge as winners in this space are also likely to exhibit these kinds [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=297.5s)]
*  of characteristics. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  Things like focusing on high volume areas of transaction really in the spirit of engendering [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=302.58s)]
*  stickiness with their customers. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=308.09999999999997s)]
*  An example of this is Ribbon Health which plugs into billions of financial, insurance [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=310.18s)]
*  and referral transactions that occur every year amongst virtual care companies that require [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=315.9s)]
*  some piece of information about physicians which weaves them tightly into the core workflows [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=320.18s)]
*  of their customer base. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=324.94s)]
*  We also like to see companies that connect multiple stakeholders where integration between [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=326.58s)]
*  those stakeholders has historically been very non-trivally challenging. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=330.78s)]
*  We love intersections. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=334.73999999999995s)]
*  It's really where both the biggest challenges have been with regards to building healthcare [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=335.73999999999995s)]
*  companies but also where network effects can be generated. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=339.14s)]
*  An example of this is Eligible which is a company that connects providers and payers [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=342.9s)]
*  to automate transactions around financial clearance and eligibility verification that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=347.94s)]
*  have historically required faxes and phone calls and where APIs historically have not [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=352.38s)]
*  really existed. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=356.38s)]
*  And then finally, we believe that the winners will have to have not just a focus on digital [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=357.9s)]
*  health initially but also an executable path for selling to incumbents over time as well. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=361.62s)]
*  Eventually, even the legacy players will adopt virtual first care models. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=367.5s)]
*  In fact, most of them already are and that presents a nice way to significantly expand [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=371.26s)]
*  the addressable market for these health tech companies. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=375.97999999999996s)]
*  An example of this is Wheel which has a virtual clinic platform that has traditionally enabled [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=378.34s)]
*  digital health companies to build flexible telehealth capacity into their business models [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=384.14s)]
*  but they are also being looked at by incumbent providers and payers even as they spin up [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=389.09999999999997s)]
*  virtual care programs that may be challenging to staff through more traditional means. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=393.86s)]
*  A very likely outcome of this whole movement of digital health companies becoming buyers [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=400.14s)]
*  of health tech is that the quality bar for healthcare products will increase relative [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=403.65999999999997s)]
*  to where it has been with traditional provider and payer users. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=408.74s)]
*  At my own startup, which sold software to legacy enterprises, I always felt that we [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  rarely got credit from our customers for the quality of our products, whether it be around [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=416.94s)]
*  user experience, user interface, high-skill performance or even the availability of modern [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=421.3s)]
*  APIs versus things like integration capabilities with legacy systems like Epic, compatibility [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=426.26s)]
*  with workflows even if those workflows were not optimal, and compliance whether it's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=432.74s)]
*  security or privacy or things of that sort, which while very, very important only represent [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=437.06s)]
*  really the most basic set of requirements. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=441.78s)]
*  Many of the buyers at these digital health companies are world-class technologists in [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=444.29999999999995s)]
*  their own right and they've seen what world-class technology looks like in other industries [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  and therefore won't settle for anything less in their own tech stack. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=452.85999999999996s)]
*  We've all lamented for far too long about the crappy user experiences and performance [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=456.85999999999996s)]
*  of legacy healthcare IT systems and I view this movement as our opportunity to change [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=461.7s)]
*  that, starting with digital health companies in that whole universe but then ultimately [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=467.61999999999995s)]
*  seeping into the traditional care delivery organizations over time as they too modernize [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=471.58s)]
*  their own ways of doing business. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHENpEHNB1U&t=477.38s)]
