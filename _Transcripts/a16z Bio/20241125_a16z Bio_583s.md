# Disrupt Yourself
**a16z Bio:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4)
* NEXT [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=0.0s)]
*  Please welcome to the stage, Vijay Pandey. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=60.0s)]
*  Good evening and welcome to our second Build Summit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=73.16s)]
*  We call it Build for a couple of reasons. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=76.88s)]
*  The first is because everyone in this room represents our best hope for building a future [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=80.0s)]
*  better healthcare, better drugs, better care, better access. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=86.16s)]
*  The second is because Build is a process. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=93.36s)]
*  It's a journey. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=95.96s)]
*  We talk about Build the way our nation's founders talk about a more perfect union. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=98.36s)]
*  For the founders, it was their work as leaders to be constantly perfecting. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  The same way as our work as leaders in healthcare to be constantly building. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=109.52s)]
*  So how can we build the healthcare future we want, the future we need? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=115.96s)]
*  I bet you think I'm going to say AI. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=123.6s)]
*  That's already come up today. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=127.44s)]
*  But AI is a means, not an end. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=130.66s)]
*  It's a tool that can help us achieve what I do want to talk about. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=133.88s)]
*  An industrial revolution in life sciences and healthcare. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=139.16s)]
*  Industrial revolutions have historically driven massive changes for humanity. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=144.82s)]
*  Where people live, where they work, how society is organized. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  But what's actionable about that insight? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  And where do we go from there? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=157.98s)]
*  Let's break it down. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=160.88s)]
*  Industrial means something very specific. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  It means shifting from bespoke to engineered. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=166.12s)]
*  From an artisanal process like making textiles by hand to a process that can be automated [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=170.98s)]
*  and therefore that can be engineered. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=177.2s)]
*  We love engineering because it's synonymous with consistent improvement that compounds [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=180.12s)]
*  over time. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  Think compounding interest. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=187.7s)]
*  Think Moore's law for computing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  Think Flatley's law for genomics. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=192.7s)]
*  AI will change the world because it's going to industrialize endeavors that could previously [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=194.89999999999998s)]
*  only be done by artisans. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=200.6s)]
*  And it's already happening. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=204.44s)]
*  In life sciences, we are industrializing the process of discovery itself. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=206.88s)]
*  In a world where we engineer biology, we don't discover drugs, we don't happen upon them [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=213.92s)]
*  by chance. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=218.12s)]
*  We drive them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=219.6s)]
*  In the same way, healthcare delivery has also been a bespoke process. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  Genome developments in gen.ai are making it possible to create tools, automate tasks, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=226.64s)]
*  and otherwise augment the work of knowledge workers. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's not just coders and financiers. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=234.72s)]
*  It's also physicians and scientists. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=237.94s)]
*  This will be a massive transformation for the whole economy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's why we call this a revolution. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=247.48s)]
*  But revolutions produce new winners and new losers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=251.0s)]
*  They lead to major transitions, and sometimes jarring and painful ones. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=256.16s)]
*  And here's the irony. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  To end up on the winning side of the revolution, to avoid the pain of disruption, you have [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=264.44s)]
*  to disrupt yourself. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=270.64000000000004s)]
*  Big question is how? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  Let me walk you through the levels of disruption. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=277.64000000000004s)]
*  Career disruption. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=281.92s)]
*  Making yourself career disruption means making connections between radically different industries. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=283.96s)]
*  What draws me to this topic is that I've disrupted my career twice. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  I began as the first employee at a video game startup. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  But then a few years in, I was hospitalized with a serious infection and took four days [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=298.12s)]
*  for them to diagnose and find the right antibiotic. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=302.76s)]
*  That fundamentally changed my mindset. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=307.0s)]
*  I wanted to help make better medicines, better treatments. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=309.36s)]
*  So I pursued an academic career becoming a professor at Stanford, founding the Folding [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=314.12s)]
*  Home Distributed Computing Project. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=318.92s)]
*  We pushed the limits of AI and computational drug design, yielding commercial spin-outs [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=321.56s)]
*  like Genesis Therapeutics. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=325.44s)]
*  But as I saw the early developments taking place in the broader field of AI, biotechnology, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=328.48s)]
*  and health, those technologies had clearly reached a pivotal point. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=334.96s)]
*  And that is what led me to found ASICS and Z BioHealth in 2015, where many of those innovations [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=342.0s)]
*  have now been translated at scale. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=348.08s)]
*  But that begs the question, how do you disrupt that scale? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=350.52s)]
*  Disruption at the scale of an entire company lies in social engineering. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=357.34s)]
*  In 1999, Reed Hastings described his vision of a future where all entertainment came into [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=363.8s)]
*  the home streamed over the internet, at a time when we all just watched DVDs. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=369.76s)]
*  At one point, even though Netflix's DVD business drove all of the company's profit, they did [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=375.28s)]
*  a radical move of social engineering. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=381.32s)]
*  They just stopped inviting the DVD employees to company meetings. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=383.48s)]
*  They knew they needed to keep their focus and investment on the future, and it took [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=390.8s)]
*  a different team to do that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=394.92s)]
*  Disruption of entire industries means embedding the future in the present. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=399.56s)]
*  Okay, that's a cryptic phrase. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  Let me unravel what that means. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=407.82s)]
*  Years ago, Nvidia was primarily a graphics company for gaming. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=410.22s)]
*  Along the way, Jensen Long made a perplexing decision to introduce CUDA, a computing architecture [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=414.64s)]
*  onto Nvidia's GPUs. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=420.92s)]
*  CUDA didn't make the hardware better for gaming. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  If anything, it made it worse and more expensive. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=426.56s)]
*  In the short run, there were quarters where the company did worse than it otherwise would [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=429.96s)]
*  have. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=433.48s)]
*  In the long run, that decision has paid many times over. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=434.78s)]
*  And due to that early vision, Nvidia is now synonymous with AI. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  The hardest of all requires leading existing partners into the future. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=446.0s)]
*  It was the first decade of the 2000s, the iPod was the best thing Apple had going. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=451.04s)]
*  But Steve Jobs actually had something even grander in the wings, the iPhone. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=457.04s)]
*  While Apple could make an iPod on its own, an iPhone needed a lot more help. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=462.76000000000005s)]
*  They couldn't build a worldwide telecommunications network on their own. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=467.04s)]
*  Apple had an even greater problem. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=471.56s)]
*  The iPhone wasn't even a good phone. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=473.4s)]
*  So their partner would have to believe that their core business, telephones, was going [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=476.2s)]
*  to be disrupted by a really bad phone. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=481.28s)]
*  And they should join Apple on this journey to the future. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  After 18 months of secret negotiations, AT&T Wireless agreed to be their exclusive partner. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=488.96s)]
*  And Jobs thereby successfully disrupted both Apple and the entire ecosystem. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=495.28s)]
*  Okay, so some of you may be thinking, well, that's tech. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=502.4s)]
*  That's not us. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  That's not life sciences. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=508.44s)]
*  That's not healthcare. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=509.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, before disruption, phones weren't tech. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=512.04s)]
*  Before disruption, games weren't tech. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=515.4599999999999s)]
*  Before disruption, movies weren't tech. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=517.8s)]
*  We called them tech after they'd been disrupted by tech. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=520.56s)]
*  20 years from now, people will be telling stories about us. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=526.32s)]
*  What disruption stories will they tell? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=532.84s)]
*  About disrupting ourselves as individuals, as companies, as an industry, as an ecosystem. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=536.28s)]
*  Think about what it would mean for patients if we could work together to disrupt sick [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=545.16s)]
*  care, to disrupt that same pattern we've been in for too long. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=549.96s)]
*  To reshape the arc of care. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=555.7199999999999s)]
*  To change the way we prevent and treat illness. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=557.5999999999999s)]
*  Without hyperbole, to fundamentally improve the very prospects for humanity. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  What could be more meaningful? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=569.24s)]
*  What could be more exciting? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=571.52s)]
*  What could be a better legacy? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  Welcome to Build. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=577.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=578.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrwYu6IZB4&t=579.88s)]
