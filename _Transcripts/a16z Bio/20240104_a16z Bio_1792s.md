# Fireside Chat with Sean Duffy
**a16z Bio:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4)
*  So, welcome to Raising Health. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=0.0s)]
*  The news for 2024 is that BioEats World is getting an upgrade. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=2.44s)]
*  We're rebranding as Raising Health. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=6.68s)]
*  And as our very first guest on Raising Health, it's my pleasure to welcome Sean Duffy, CEO [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=9.28s)]
*  and co-founder of Amada Health. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  So, Sean, thank you so much for joining. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=16.48s)]
*  Yeah, Vijay, thank you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=18.04s)]
*  And thanks for allowing me to be the first. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=19.04s)]
*  What an honor. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=20.84s)]
*  This starts with actually that email that you sent me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=22.12s)]
*  I think that's actually maybe even a tweet that I saw that Amada hit a million patients. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=24.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=30.64s)]
*  And so that was a huge deal. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=31.64s)]
*  And I think that made us very sentimental about like all the whole path that you've [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=33.08s)]
*  been through and the path that we've been through together. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=36.52s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=38.24s)]
*  No, I mean, a million, you know, we're really proud of it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=39.24s)]
*  I'm proud of it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=41.8s)]
*  I'm proud of the team. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=42.8s)]
*  You know, I think it's a lot of people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=43.8s)]
*  It's a big impact. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=44.8s)]
*  And I think if you pull up, I think it is a statement on where digital health has come [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=45.8s)]
*  from and that it's possible. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=49.92s)]
*  Admittedly, I feel two ways about it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=52.6s)]
*  I think the positives are, my gosh, it took so many years of toil to even get to the couple [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=55.800000000000004s)]
*  of thousand. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=61.36s)]
*  But then if you compare the million to the task at hand of actually impacting epidemiology [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=62.36s)]
*  and really doing what we need to do for the business, we haven't really, really made a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=67.92s)]
*  dent yet. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Kind of told our teams, let's celebrate for 30 seconds and let's go try to get it to 10, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  20, 50 and beyond. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=77.2s)]
*  You make a great point because a million is hitting scale, but in principle, you could [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=78.92s)]
*  get to tens, hundreds of millions and even beyond. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=83.28s)]
*  How do you view the next steps? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=87.56s)]
*  How do you get to that type of scale? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=90.12s)]
*  Well, I think you're at a million, you're on strong foundations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=92.24s)]
*  As long as you're serving your members well and you're serving your customers well, it [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=95.28s)]
*  does become slightly easier because we're in a new state in digital health where it's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=98.36s)]
*  a little bit more accepted. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  There's a little bit more trust. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  We now have published trials, data, et cetera. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=105.76s)]
*  We're staying hungry as possible. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=108.44s)]
*  I think it just shows that the space though has progressed a lot. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  It's still relatively nascent relative to having the impact that it can and will. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=114.0s)]
*  Well, before we get too far ahead of ourselves, actually, I'd love to take us back to the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  beginning. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  To set the stage, I guess it's 2011. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  When you started Omada, obviously, there were zero patients then. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  What did that zero to one part of the startup look like? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=129.84s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=132.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=133.48s)]
*  I'm here in the recent offices speaking with someone who probably isn't in the same camp, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  but I've always been pulled between technology and science and healthcare. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=139.56s)]
*  Originally, I thought I had to choose. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  I had to pick tech or healthcare. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  After undergrad, even though I did my pre-med recs, I worked at Google for a couple of years. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=149.44s)]
*  Went off to medical school. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  I was enrolled in Harvard's MD, MBA. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Then through that came up with the idea for Omada. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  Really, the key reflection was a statement of where the mark was at the time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=159.92s)]
*  I'd be with my tech friends from Google, and they were like, oh my gosh, these Fitbits, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=163.96s)]
*  they're going to change healthcare. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=166.88s)]
*  My medical school classmates were like, well, where's the level one evidence? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=168.84s)]
*  What diseases are you targeting? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  The idea for Omada was to build a convergence company. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=174.0s)]
*  One that didn't sacrifice on technology and design, but tried to do so in such a way where [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=176.66s)]
*  it earned the trust of the existing healthcare market. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=183.12s)]
*  That led to the business. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=186.96s)]
*  Zero to one, it was a journey. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=187.96s)]
*  We were a little ahead of our times. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  When we founded the company, the world didn't know what to do with us. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=192.96s)]
*  Tell us more. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=197.28s)]
*  You were a tech company, but you were also a healthcare company. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=198.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=201.24s)]
*  In the early days of Omada, for instance, you'd say hi to a health plan and say, I want [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=202.24s)]
*  to contract as a provider. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=207.12s)]
*  I'm like, okay, great. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  Where are your clinics? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=211.0s)]
*  We don't have any. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=212.0s)]
*  Excuse me, where are your clinics? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=213.0s)]
*  No, we're provider. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=215.0s)]
*  We don't have offices. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=217.4s)]
*  They're like, you can't contract with our network team. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=218.4s)]
*  It's like a hotel chain without hotels. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=221.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=223.04s)]
*  To be honest, the last 10 years has been that scene from Apollo 13 with the square CO2 cartridge [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=224.04s)]
*  and round hole where you just try to somehow pull it off with the parts on the ship before [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=229.44s)]
*  your oxygen depletes, which is your bank account in startup language. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=233.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=237.24s)]
*  I made that analogy to the hotel company without hotels. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=238.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=241.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=242.2s)]
*  There's Airbnb and then there's fleets without cars and so on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=243.2s)]
*  Does it make sense? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  In that zero to one time, there was probably some surprises. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if there's any no surprises that make sense for accounts. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=252.28s)]
*  I quickly realized how hard it was to sell into enterprise healthcare. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=257.2s)]
*  It was a surprise to me. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=261.08s)]
*  Now it's not a surprise at all. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll kind of relay that to any tech founder. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  The key thing was that it was not sexy to be a startup. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=265.8s)]
*  This was kind of a moment in time where I was like, oh my gosh, the zeitgeist was that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=268.92s)]
*  20 something founder that goes off and builds a $10 billion company. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=272.6s)]
*  You'd be with these health plans. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=276.4s)]
*  I'm like, I'm never calling ourselves a startup. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=277.4s)]
*  So we were three people and Omada was a digital health company. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=280.0s)]
*  You had to quickly try to frame yourself as a measured thoughtful business in order to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=284.21999999999997s)]
*  have success. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=289.92s)]
*  When you were raising, you were raising probably from tech VCs primarily. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=291.64s)]
*  Now there are examples of tech bio VCs or health tech VCs that are doing both. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=296.76s)]
*  It's worth noting that actually, A6 and Z's investment in Omada pre-gates the bio fund [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=304.8s)]
*  itself. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=311.12s)]
*  It's a good statement. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=312.12s)]
*  I'm more than you just said. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=313.12s)]
*  How has the investor landscape changed for you? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=314.12s)]
*  It's not any day different. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=317.68s)]
*  We were the first major healthcare investment from Andreessen, but there were very few conversions [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=318.68s)]
*  funds. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=322.32s)]
*  You'd be on the healthcare kind of fund track and they're like, well, excuse me, where specifically [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=323.32s)]
*  is your monopolistic IP? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=330.08s)]
*  And it's going to be just so easy for any health plan to build software. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=331.08s)]
*  That's what they're known for, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=337.44s)]
*  You go to the tech side and they're like, how about that budget item for that million [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=339.92s)]
*  dollar peer reviewed study and RCT you're thinking about running? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=343.88s)]
*  I don't think we need that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=346.76s)]
*  So you'd work to kind of explain. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=348.6s)]
*  I think that was very much sort of in our mind for launching the bio fund, which came [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  after the investment of Omada that realizing that you were a tech company and there are [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=357.0s)]
*  other tech companies that happen to be in life sciences or in healthcare, but were being [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=360.56s)]
*  built like tech companies and that was the opportunity. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=364.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, a hundred percent. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  So any other changes that you've seen to the space? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=368.0s)]
*  You're very much a pioneer of digital health. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=370.16s)]
*  That's probably changed over this decade as well. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=372.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=374.48s)]
*  I mean, once we talked about the investment landscape, I think equally you've seen drastic [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=375.48s)]
*  differences in both the go-to-market landscape and the talent landscape. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=379.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=383.68s)]
*  We shouldn't take each in turn. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=384.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=385.68s)]
*  I mean, it's very different. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=387.64s)]
*  I think there are like more plays. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=388.64s)]
*  There's still kind of things to be learned. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=389.92s)]
*  I think if you use Omada as an example, we started targeting self-insured employers that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=390.92s)]
*  can turn into business with plans and there's a little bit of emotion now that is slightly [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=394.88s)]
*  more codified. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, albeit it's still very difficult, very capital intensive, but it's more of a known [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  thing and there's been examples. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=404.64s)]
*  Well, so what makes it difficult? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=406.56s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of stakeholders. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  The buying cycles are really long. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=410.24s)]
*  You're dealing with not just HR leaders, but consultants and their plans and their channels [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  and it's a very multi-state core Volsera's process and still a risk in-person environment, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  but there's a little bit of like a known way to do it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  And when Omada founded, that was far less so. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you'd seen CastLite work towards selling into employers, but a little bit not the way [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  that Omada was doing it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=431.24s)]
*  We figured out a way to build through claims. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=432.48s)]
*  We took our trials to the American Medical Association, got them to issue the first ever [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=434.0s)]
*  digital specific CPT code just literally for billing infrastructure. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=438.24s)]
*  Now, there's many startups that have figured out on the back of that how to build through [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  claims and contract as a provider like we talked about before. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=445.52s)]
*  So the world has evolved. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=448.76s)]
*  If I could make one statement that I think is the most beneficial relative to the go [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  to market is buyers better know how to buy. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=455.52s)]
*  So how do you make that happen? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=459.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's come as Omada that you're like, well, and I remember in the early days, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=460.44s)]
*  you'd be talking to the network teams and you're like, you know, I'm imagining a world [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=465.32s)]
*  where there's actually specific individuals on a network team focused on your digital [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=469.47999999999996s)]
*  provider network. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=474.0s)]
*  And you just kind of paint this future that could be, but that's not there yet. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=475.48s)]
*  And then you just kind of work your way to it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=478.92s)]
*  And a bit of his learning together with your partners, like how do you implement, you know, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=481.68s)]
*  what are the claim systems? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=485.0s)]
*  And then the next one that comes in the door, they're like, oh, we've kind of done this [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=486.12s)]
*  before. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=488.4s)]
*  And, you know, I remember one experience that it was a health plan. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=489.4s)]
*  So I get a call from a CEO of another digital health company. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=492.52s)]
*  I was like, hey, I just want to take five minutes to thank you. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=495.96s)]
*  Like, well, why? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=499.04s)]
*  And he's like, I just we just did this deal with a health plan. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=500.04s)]
*  And kind of named it and they sent over the papers, the contract, and they just forgot [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=503.04s)]
*  to take one modest name out of it all. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=507.64s)]
*  How long did that take you to close? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=511.16s)]
*  He's like, you know, three months. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=512.8s)]
*  I was like, well, that took a year and a half. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=513.8s)]
*  Yeah. And what that means is, all right, there are there are plenty of ambitious [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=515.12s)]
*  digitally for people, enterprise health care. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=520.12s)]
*  But like, there's also like laid down processes and infrastructure and ways of buying [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=522.04s)]
*  that are pretty solidified. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=529.28s)]
*  So it takes a little bit of time to like chip at it, morph it, you know, make it a [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=530.48s)]
*  little bit malleable and then and then kind of lay new foundations on how to just [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=534.48s)]
*  ingest things like Omada. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=538.4s)]
*  Yeah. Once you've re tempered that steel, that's correct. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=540.0s)]
*  Exactly. That's right. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=542.32s)]
*  It's it's ready to go. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=543.24s)]
*  And then you mentioned something on the talent side, too. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=544.48s)]
*  This changes from everything, the current state to kind of the feeder, the feeder [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=546.32s)]
*  world. I remember in medical school, it was kind of like me and like two other [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=549.84s)]
*  people in my med school class who had an entrepreneurial bent. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=554.16s)]
*  Then, you know, there was a lot of what out of like hundreds. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=557.48s)]
*  Like 250. And it's funny, like I restarted the Harvard Medical School, like [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=560.36s)]
*  entrepreneurship, the study died and died. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=565.64s)]
*  I know it existed. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=567.8s)]
*  Yes. There was only a society of three wither on the vine. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=570.08s)]
*  And like so, you know, how to give it CPR and get that thing back going. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=574.04s)]
*  And now I think that's different. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=577.04s)]
*  It's like, you know, today's cursive is JavaScript. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=578.48s)]
*  So you're not on it's not. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=580.6s)]
*  So there's just more tech fluidity coming out of the, you know, I think the life [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=583.44s)]
*  sciences, which speaks to more talent that can appreciate both worlds, which [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=588.84s)]
*  speaks to cultures that can pull the best of both worlds together, which speaks to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=593.24s)]
*  it just being easier to build a convergence business. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=597.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'd love to see this graph of time and the fraction of med school [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=599.88s)]
*  students who have taken a CS course. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=605.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no, no. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=607.52s)]
*  Probably just like growing dramatically. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=608.52s)]
*  It's growing dramatically. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=610.84s)]
*  Well, it's key because like if you really weren't sort of sophisticated on the tech [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=611.72s)]
*  side, you wouldn't be able to handle that side of it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=615.4000000000001s)]
*  It seems like at least part of the problem early on was there are just so few people [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=617.44s)]
*  that were conversant in both. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=621.5200000000001s)]
*  And it's and it's funny, it's both like a vision issue that's super important, but [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=622.9200000000001s)]
*  it's also like a hiring issue. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=626.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=628.32s)]
*  You know, at the end of the day, like you need to be able to pull in incredible [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=628.6s)]
*  skill sets in your organization. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=631.32s)]
*  And if the language you're using, like doesn't communicate that you understand [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  the skills that that person is bringing to bear and you can't just like, you know, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=637.36s)]
*  over a beer, like riff on a specific thing in the world, they're not going to join. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=641.24s)]
*  So, I mean, that's that's one of the reasons why the legacy health services companies [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=646.4s)]
*  have had trouble hiring talent. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=649.28s)]
*  They'll put out a role for like, you know, IT engineer in the language and just the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=650.76s)]
*  appreciation of the skill sets like matter. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=654.8s)]
*  And it's hard to get that if you don't if you're if you're on the top talent, we're [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=656.68s)]
*  not going to want to they're not going to do it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=659.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they're not. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=661.4s)]
*  And the same, you know, the same as on the health care side, like if you're I mean, if [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=662.52s)]
*  you're just an amazing tech company, you're trying to hire a great health care talent, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=665.16s)]
*  they're like, they don't know. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=669.04s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=670.52s)]
*  Well, how's it going now? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=672.28s)]
*  Like, how is it hiring sort of the latest crop like on the MLI site? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=673.08s)]
*  Specific to that, what's neat is we have just an awesome data corpus, because I mean, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=677.4000000000001s)]
*  you know, at the end of the day, like, you know, these models are more or less [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=680.84s)]
*  commodities. It's what feeds them that's important. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=683.08s)]
*  And Omada has operated against our users preferences, which is asynchronous [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=685.2s)]
*  messaging, large part. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=691.2s)]
*  So, you know, about 25 million messages that have flown back and forth between our [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=692.24s)]
*  care teams and our members, which, you know, I mean, maybe the richest data, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=697.12s)]
*  asynchronous text data corpus in metabolic care and, you know, LLMs are kind of [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=701.68s)]
*  they came in a nice time for us. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=707.52s)]
*  It's a candy store for any kid would love. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=708.6s)]
*  That's right. So that talent side is fine. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=710.56s)]
*  But the neat thing relative to the last kind of couple of minutes of conversation is [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=713.0s)]
*  now there's a crop of folks that have worked in tech and health care. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=718.12s)]
*  Maybe we're there to start up that try to do both, but, you know, didn't work out or [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=721.92s)]
*  maybe they're a company that has scaled and they want to, you know, do something [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=725.64s)]
*  different. So there are. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=728.72s)]
*  There's there's just actually a richer crop of talent to pull from. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=730.28s)]
*  It's no longer, you know, we're trying to steal from Omada. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=734.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, people are experienced with both. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  It's kind of a broader, a broader set, which is which is great. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  I think it's a it's an amazing thing. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=741.0s)]
*  It's a real ecosystem. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=742.4s)]
*  Well, so 10 years changes all of us. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=743.72s)]
*  How have you changed? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=745.84s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. I mean, I was extremely green when I founded Omada. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=747.04s)]
*  I was in an MD MBA program, but hadn't done any of the business side. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=750.6s)]
*  I didn't have any managerial experience. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=753.04s)]
*  I didn't know what a venture capitalist was. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=755.36s)]
*  My goal has always been each year I want to look back at last year, Sean, and just feel a little bit embarrassed. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=756.96s)]
*  Wow. Oh, that's a really unique way to frame it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=762.92s)]
*  I got literally every year. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=764.88s)]
*  But embarrassed is that being hard on yourself? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=765.88s)]
*  I mean, maybe it is, but it's it's the truth. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=767.6s)]
*  So I think I have been just a little bit embarrassed about every every proceeding, Sean. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=769.68s)]
*  So the Sean now is very, very different than the vintage, the vintage 2011 Sean. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=774.36s)]
*  And I mean, you know, you've been on the board a number of years. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=779.24s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen it, too. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=781.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, actually, now when I think about it, after you said that, it's it's [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=782.24s)]
*  the the thing that most people get embarrassed about is like when you watch yourself on video or you listen to yourself. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=786.88s)]
*  It's actually the fact it's getting embarrassed is not unusual. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=794.32s)]
*  It's the fact that you're willing to look at that and look at it in its face. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=797.88s)]
*  I think that is really takes bravery and is most people don't do that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=802.24s)]
*  The way that I think through it is is to think through decisions or mistakes. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=805.36s)]
*  Like, which would that have happened with today's, you know, Sean, that misstep that we made with today's Sean have fallen into that trap. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=808.88s)]
*  And I think it's a good it's I think it's a good mindset. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=815.48s)]
*  I think similarly, you know, I always encourage entrepreneurs to like, especially founders, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=817.52s)]
*  try to purposely decouple yourself from the founder mind and the CEO mind. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=822.72s)]
*  How would you differentiate those two? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=828.96s)]
*  Like like the in fact, sometimes I purposely ask, like, let's just pretend I was a hired gun CEO brought in today. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=830.72s)]
*  Like, what would I be doing differently? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=838.16s)]
*  You know, day one, great. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=841.16s)]
*  You know, just joined Omada. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm the CEO. Like, what what would be the next play? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=844.08s)]
*  And then and then you can similarly ask, what do you think the the organization needs from its CEO? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=847.2s)]
*  Like next year and beyond. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  And then that that like becomes your L.N.D. plan. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=855.36s)]
*  Also, organizations need sometimes things from their founders to which are unique from what they need from the CEOs. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=858.24s)]
*  That's yeah, that's right. You could reverse it to you could reverse it to. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=863.2s)]
*  And there have there have been things I mean, you know, as the org grows, you have to even as a founder, especially learn how to like work [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=865.44s)]
*  with your organization because your teams, you know, you have so many bright people and they need to like find the energy [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=871.8399999999999s)]
*  around a direction and you have to set the strategy. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=876.9599999999999s)]
*  But there are certain things that I think is very helpful with kind of founder orientation, like you that optimism, you know, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=878.9599999999999s)]
*  doesn't always tend to like carry forward with scale. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=884.92s)]
*  And if there's like new things in the market, like for us, this whole GLP one landscape or, you know, the generative area landscape, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=887.56s)]
*  there's new things like I view it as my job to like just press the organization into into seizing those. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=894.24s)]
*  Yeah, to really sort of almost get keep that spirit that you had when you were like 10 people or three people, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=900.4399999999999s)]
*  but not to do that scale. You do it at scale. Exactly. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=905.72s)]
*  Any advice you'd give to Sean? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=907.9599999999999s)]
*  That's a good question. I mean, all sorts of tactical stuff. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=911.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. My number one advice is put a ton of thought in how you price and package kind of what you've what you're buying. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=913.36s)]
*  That has just so much path dependency. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=920.8399999999999s)]
*  There's all these other tactical. Yeah. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=922.8s)]
*  And that sounds like a detail, but that's like the core future of your business in a sense. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=924.16s)]
*  Yeah, I know. It's funny. It's never the strategic stuff that tends to matter as much as the tactical things. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=929.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And some of them you can read about and others like, you know, is a little on the job training. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=933.92s)]
*  Well, especially if you're creating a field, then there probably wasn't on the job training for digital. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It was newer. Yeah, exactly. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=943.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Well, OK, so let's let's take us to today. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=944.9599999999999s)]
*  So and actually brought up two great topics. I'm going to hit AI and GLP. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=947.68s)]
*  And so let's start with the AI side. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=953.52s)]
*  So you already mentioned that Amada has this huge corpus. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=955.24s)]
*  What's your take for how AI is going to change Amada? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=959.2399999999999s)]
*  Where do you go with that? Where do you go from here? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=962.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's just so cool. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=964.68s)]
*  I mean, the whole team and the engineering team is just giddy with it. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=966.8s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, there's yesterday's like AI, which we've been doing, you know, build, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=970.1199999999999s)]
*  you know, build models and ML models and, you know, recommend resources. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=973.3199999999999s)]
*  Like small ML, small AI versus a large foundation model. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=976.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Versus versus kind of the generative side. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=980.4s)]
*  I mean, there's hundreds of ideas on how to best leverage our data. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=983.0s)]
*  So we're still learning and, you know, and growing. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=985.24s)]
*  But to give you just some specific examples right now, the [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=987.6800000000001s)]
*  one thing we launched is the ability for our care teams to just see, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=991.24s)]
*  you know, instantly summarized views of eating history of their members. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=995.88s)]
*  So what we found is like if they wanted to talk about food, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1001.96s)]
*  we had a very beautifully structured like view where they could scroll [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1004.96s)]
*  through the meal patterns, looking at the eating patterns. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1008.5600000000001s)]
*  But they're spending about six minutes [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1011.0s)]
*  getting the context to be able to craft a message. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1013.28s)]
*  And so one quick hit was, you know, have have the model do that. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1016.16s)]
*  Right. And then they can take that and craft it and craft a note to the member [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1020.2s)]
*  that allows them to just feel more insightful, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1024.52s)]
*  you know, just more precise and likely more impactful and more efficient. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1027.48s)]
*  It's like everybody wins in that. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1031.6s)]
*  Maybe even more empathetic sometimes. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1032.64s)]
*  And more. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1034.04s)]
*  More empathetic. There's like step one for a model, which is [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1035.88s)]
*  all right, of these hundred ideas, one of the ones where you have high [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1039.16s)]
*  impact, you know, low regulatory risk, because there are considerations [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1042.84s)]
*  that you need to think through here. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1046.32s)]
*  We're trying to strike that balance of ensuring that, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1047.48s)]
*  you know, at the end of the day, like we people feel the compassion [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1050.6s)]
*  of the amadas, you know, services as well as the intelligence where, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1053.08s)]
*  you know, you've got to have a humanist shine through. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1056.6399999999999s)]
*  And so for us right now, we built our care team platform homegrown by scratch. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1059.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's about helping to enable our care teams to, you know, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  be authentic humans, to come across that way, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1068.6799999999998s)]
*  do it more efficiently and per your point, in many instances, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1071.36s)]
*  with a little tee up, perhaps more empathetically. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1073.84s)]
*  Well, it's really interesting because you sort of alluded to the history [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1076.52s)]
*  of virtual based care, where it's like not having brick and mortar [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1079.76s)]
*  was like kind of crazy, right? Yep. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1083.32s)]
*  And now that's actually especially post covid. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1085.48s)]
*  It's actually been quite routine. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1087.6799999999998s)]
*  Actually, many of us prefer it to some degree. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1089.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it has its own conveniences and so on. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1091.56s)]
*  Now you're almost like a different type of virtual, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1095.1599999999999s)]
*  because now you're even like the caregivers themselves. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1096.96s)]
*  It can be totally virtualized. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1099.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny. How far does that go? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1101.84s)]
*  Does it? Are you always going to have caregivers [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1103.76s)]
*  and you're just massively scaling them? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1105.96s)]
*  Are there like, you know, like take us five years into the future, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1107.76s)]
*  like maybe even 10 years in the future. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1111.24s)]
*  Like, how far does this go? I mean, it's going to be balanced. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1112.8s)]
*  I think the you know, you remember in peak covid, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1115.3600000000001s)]
*  it was like virtual care will do everything. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1118.0s)]
*  And I literally I felt like the crazy one being like guys, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1119.56s)]
*  like biopsies still need to be done. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1121.32s)]
*  Surgeries. Moles need to be removed. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1123.44s)]
*  So it's and it'll be the same the same truth here. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1125.6s)]
*  There's a reason that artificial intelligence is a buzzword [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1128.16s)]
*  and artificial empathy is not. Yeah. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1131.2s)]
*  And I don't think there is any substitute [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1133.92s)]
*  for just the human accountability. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1136.8400000000001s)]
*  And in fact, I actually think that maybe in this era of like, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1138.44s)]
*  you know, AI, it may be actually come more valuable, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1142.0800000000002s)]
*  like human time, you know, handcrafted goods, like, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1145.48s)]
*  you know, proper human caregivers that may feel more valuable. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1149.0s)]
*  In the same vein, you can leverage not just them, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1152.8400000000001s)]
*  but TIP and augmented support, you know, through these models [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1155.4s)]
*  in a way that I think just will transform outcomes and, you know, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1158.8000000000002s)]
*  impact the impact the world. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1161.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, we talked about scaling [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1162.8400000000001s)]
*  and we talked about the million members. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1165.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, this is how you get there. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1166.88s)]
*  Yeah, it helps. Yeah. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1168.3200000000002s)]
*  OK. It's such a crazy time because we've got AI. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1170.16s)]
*  Yeah. Like doing this insane thing. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1173.64s)]
*  And then generally unrelated to AI, but very related to it. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1175.64s)]
*  I'm on it. Yeah, exactly. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1179.0s)]
*  It's GLP ones. Yeah. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1181.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, how does that play into what you're doing in a monitor? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1182.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I just feel giddy with what's happening [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1185.16s)]
*  because you've got this two parallel tracks, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1187.2s)]
*  like just extraordinary technology innovation, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1189.44s)]
*  extraordinary life sciences innovation, like two different silos. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1192.0s)]
*  And I mean, similar to like the fact that your convergence investor, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1194.8000000000002s)]
*  Oma, as a convergence company, they just hit each other. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1197.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Like right now, you know, right at the moment. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1199.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think they're both, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1201.92s)]
*  you know, really have knocked on the doors, you know, of Oma [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1203.8400000000001s)]
*  as a skilled provider that, you know, has not only the data [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1208.48s)]
*  for the generative AI side, but also just enough scale to [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1211.0s)]
*  and enough clinical credibility to capture the opportunity in GLP ones. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1214.68s)]
*  The way I look at them is incredible. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1218.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, incredible breakthrough. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1220.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, humanity, we should pat ourselves on the back that these exist. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1221.5200000000002s)]
*  Yes. You know, in large part, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1224.92s)]
*  especially since the data has borne out in type two diabetes, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1227.68s)]
*  I think they'll generally considered a very safe medicine. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1230.16s)]
*  And hopefully that continues to be the viewpoint. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1232.5600000000002s)]
*  The challenge is GLPs are great at quantity. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1234.72s)]
*  You can and will lose weight on a GLP without changing anything [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1238.24s)]
*  about the quality of your calories because it will juice the quantity. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1243.2s)]
*  You just will lose appetite. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1248.72s)]
*  That's right. You lose appetite. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1250.3600000000001s)]
*  So you're you know, you're you're dropping your caloric intake, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1251.28s)]
*  but eating exactly the same foods. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1253.4s)]
*  The challenge with that is most patients [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1255.48s)]
*  tend to not want to be on these medicines for life, even though, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1259.16s)]
*  you know, I mean, you will find the KOLs that are, you know, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1261.32s)]
*  argue that that's the right clinical point of view right now. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1263.28s)]
*  That's counter to the patient preference. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1265.24s)]
*  And then the cost profile is making that for the employer [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1267.76s)]
*  that are covering GLPs for obesity. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1271.72s)]
*  You know, a challenge as well. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1274.6000000000001s)]
*  There are very few that, you know, are thinking, well, shoot, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1275.64s)]
*  I'll cover this for life. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1277.6000000000001s)]
*  So you have this issue where, OK, you've got quantity. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1278.56s)]
*  Well, what does the quality? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1281.84s)]
*  And that's where Amada thinks we can really differentiate. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1284.2s)]
*  If GLPs are quantity, Amada's quality, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1287.08s)]
*  because you can use these as almost a behavioral catalyst, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1289.92s)]
*  help reframe someone's psychology around, I can lose weight. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1293.76s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1297.72s)]
*  And then on that, you're like, well, what are your goals [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1298.88s)]
*  relative to the medicines? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1301.08s)]
*  You know, they're like, let's do it in a healthy way. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1302.72s)]
*  Exactly. Well, let's take advantage of this therapeutic window. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1304.96s)]
*  Yeah. Like, let's figure out some new meals [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1307.76s)]
*  that you can just start to incorporate. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1309.84s)]
*  Great. You're losing weight. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1311.32s)]
*  What are some new activities that you could do now, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1312.24s)]
*  you know, that you couldn't do otherwise? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1315.3999999999999s)]
*  And then Amada can address some of the clinical complexities here. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1317.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think that the next issue that is already [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1320.76s)]
*  starting to bubble up is sarcopenia. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1322.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, you're you know, because what's happening with these meds, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1324.6s)]
*  you'll you'll lose fat and muscle mass. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1326.76s)]
*  If you do regain, you're going to regain only fat. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1329.88s)]
*  So there's there's always complex body [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1332.0s)]
*  comp questions that are going to require a new like, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1333.68s)]
*  you know, physical activity protocols on top and recommendations [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1336.3200000000002s)]
*  and diet and intake to make sure that, you know, that you're [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1339.0s)]
*  you're addressing this this kind of truth about weight loss [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1342.76s)]
*  generally, not specific to the gym. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1344.92s)]
*  Yeah, especially if your body muscle mass goes down, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1346.1200000000001s)]
*  then your basal metabolic rate goes down. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1348.5600000000002s)]
*  It makes it makes it more likely you're again, you'll feel hunger. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1351.24s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1353.8000000000002s)]
*  And if you're only eating, I don't know, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1355.64s)]
*  1500 calories, a thousand calories with these things, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1357.28s)]
*  whatever small number it is, then every calorie counts. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1359.84s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1362.84s)]
*  Amada's made some decisions we're happy about. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1364.08s)]
*  You know, the first is to launch this like GLP one care track. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1366.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1369.36s)]
*  And then we've chosen to not initiate people on the medicines, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1370.04s)]
*  but just, you know, support them regardless of where the script came from. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1374.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1377.28s)]
*  So when we work with our partners who are covering GLPs for obesity, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1377.76s)]
*  it's like, you know, you can create kind of a little bit of an all roads [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1380.8799999999999s)]
*  to Amada strategy. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1384.0s)]
*  Like, look for these to be covered. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1385.36s)]
*  We want to make sure that you have the lifestyle support alongside. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1387.04s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1389.48s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, given all this that's going on, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1390.4399999999998s)]
*  where do you think this gets us to? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1393.36s)]
*  Like, what does digital health look like, you know, five, ten years from now? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1395.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, for Amada, I hope these innovations help us do, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1398.3999999999999s)]
*  you know, what always has kind of been the most important, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1401.76s)]
*  which is to have tomorrow's, you know, epidemiologist notice, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1403.52s)]
*  like bend and disease curve and have us be a part in that. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  It's been this weird, weird kind of thing where I feel like every couple of years [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1409.28s)]
*  used to this like report on, you know, diabetes measures, et cetera. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1412.52s)]
*  And you're like, wow, the nation's gone nowhere. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1416.16s)]
*  Was that really true? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1418.52s)]
*  Have we really gone nowhere or gone worse than nowhere? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1419.12s)]
*  We respond. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1421.28s)]
*  In fact, it's gone the wrong, you know, in a worse direction. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1422.12s)]
*  We're on a poor trajectory as a country, to say the least. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1424.36s)]
*  So, you know, I think these innovations help us hit, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1426.68s)]
*  you know, hit a level of scale that matters. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1429.24s)]
*  And this is the most acute labor crisis we ever had in the U.S. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1430.72s)]
*  On the provider's on the provider side. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1435.32s)]
*  You talk to you talk to the average provider and the C-suite. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1436.6s)]
*  What are your challenges? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1439.52s)]
*  They list, you know, ten. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1440.96s)]
*  One through eight are labor. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1443.16s)]
*  They're not, you know, we don't have enough practitioners. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1445.96s)]
*  So not enough doctors and not enough nurses. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1448.72s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, you're not we're not going to have two hundred [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1451.0s)]
*  thousand primary care clinicians like show up on a tanker. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1453.5600000000002s)]
*  So so what does that mean? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1456.76s)]
*  A, like even outside of what we do, you have to find technologies [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1458.8000000000002s)]
*  that give more leverage to every credential like inter LLMs. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1462.0s)]
*  You know, B, what you need is to provide care differently. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1465.92s)]
*  Like there is no way that a decade from now, the primary care [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1468.56s)]
*  clinician is going to be point on something like longitudinal diabetes care. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1471.92s)]
*  So Omada can come in as a between visit care provider [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1476.08s)]
*  as an adjunct to primary care and a partner and make it such that, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1479.16s)]
*  you know, really what you need to do is route the person to us [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1483.36s)]
*  and we'll handle that between visit care and take that off your plate, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1485.56s)]
*  which which I think is generally required. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1489.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing that scaling goes from an aspiration [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1491.8s)]
*  almost to an obligation. There is a silver lining. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1494.92s)]
*  I mean, this is this is just an extraordinary crisis of labor. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1497.16s)]
*  What is happening is the everyday provider recognizes that there's not, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1500.76s)]
*  you know, there's not a solvent. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1505.1200000000001s)]
*  And I mean, you've had providers that like literally they're like, well, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1506.16s)]
*  shoot, we've tried almost everything. They bought nursing schools. Right. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1509.0400000000002s)]
*  Right. Like gobbled up nursing schools to try to build. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1511.8000000000002s)]
*  But but there's nothing that's going to be enough. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1515.0400000000002s)]
*  So it's like we have to deliver care differently. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  What does that look like? Who do we work with to do it? Right. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1519.24s)]
*  And then so the shortage is one thing. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1522.0s)]
*  Then the other sort of crisis that we all know about is cost. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1524.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Presumably this plays into that as well. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1526.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. If we just kept the percent of our GDP spent on health care constant, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1529.28s)]
*  but just use the dollars better. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1533.6000000000001s)]
*  Like we've got an embarrassment of riches to put forward, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1535.52s)]
*  you know, to the country here relative to the it's not like, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1538.8s)]
*  oh, could it be done more effectively or efficiently? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1541.48s)]
*  Like look anywhere besides, you know, the U.S. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1543.44s)]
*  and you find you find ways that you that one could. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1546.6000000000001s)]
*  So but you kind of need a rock thrown into the lake. Yeah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1549.16s)]
*  And there are enough like pressure points there that I do think that [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1552.64s)]
*  the silver lining will be it's it's kind of hit the fulcrum [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1555.68s)]
*  or it's reinventing the system. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1557.96s)]
*  Well, so let's paint the picture. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1559.6000000000001s)]
*  So like you're dealing with something which is one of the biggest crises. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1561.16s)]
*  Pre diabetes, type two diabetes, weight and comorbidities, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1564.8400000000001s)]
*  hypertension, all and musculoskeletal, all the core. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1568.92s)]
*  So that's the problem is very clear. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1571.88s)]
*  And then on top of that, you have the provider problem and the cost. Yep. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1573.6000000000001s)]
*  You put in a I in GLP's. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1577.4s)]
*  It's almost like this wonderful, almost like Deus Ex Machina, like to the rescue. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1579.68s)]
*  And no technology to the rescue. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1584.72s)]
*  It's literally I'm like in absence of that, plus like, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1586.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, the model layers to tie the room together. Yeah. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1589.76s)]
*  What happens? It's you know what I mean? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1592.3200000000002s)]
*  It's like, well, well, but then so then what keeps us [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1593.96s)]
*  from the future we're describing? Like what's in our way? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1597.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, I think I think it's coming. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1600.2s)]
*  I genuinely do. I feel more optimistic than ever in general. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1601.76s)]
*  I don't think there's an overnight success. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1605.48s)]
*  I think that's especially true in in health care and building a health care business. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1606.76s)]
*  But I think it's coming. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1610.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, I well, what do you think about regulations in this space? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1611.68s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the reasons why it takes a little bit longer. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1614.28s)]
*  But especially, let's say, additional regulations for AI. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  Do you see a role for that right now? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1619.04s)]
*  That the general basis on how to use generative AI says, like, look, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1621.08s)]
*  guide a licensed practitioner. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1624.7199999999998s)]
*  So, you know, we're at that world where it's like, you know, I mean, use [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1627.1999999999998s)]
*  use self-driving as an analogy, like it's driver assisted. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1630.1599999999999s)]
*  Like you can turn it on. We got to touch the wheel. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1632.9199999999998s)]
*  And there's already Dr. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1634.6s)]
*  Google in play, you know, and so this is amplifying that. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1635.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1639.32s)]
*  And practitioners have regulatory bodies that govern their work and so on. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1640.48s)]
*  I think there will be ways to, you know, create kind of targeted, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1645.68s)]
*  you know, regulatory like pathways for hyper specific things [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1649.04s)]
*  that have low patient risk. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1652.44s)]
*  Yeah, no other obstacles. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1653.76s)]
*  It feels like the way you're talking, it feels like it's inevitable. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1655.84s)]
*  Again, I mean, it speaks to the three things that have changed. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1659.32s)]
*  What what needs to happen for an innovation ecosystem to flourish [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1661.6s)]
*  in a way that wasn't wasn't there before? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1665.28s)]
*  You need you need new capital partners. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1667.44s)]
*  There's more folks that understand tech and health care. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1670.16s)]
*  And there's some proof points that you can make money here. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1672.44s)]
*  I mean, you know, there you need that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1674.52s)]
*  to create kind of a healthy capital environment. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1676.3200000000002s)]
*  And then secondly, you know, you need like more go to market motion [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1678.1200000000001s)]
*  models that make it just a little bit easier for the next person. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1682.48s)]
*  Right. Right. And that's that's critical. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1685.3200000000002s)]
*  And then and then you need the people. Yeah. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1686.92s)]
*  And so, you know, I think you've got you've got the three of those. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1688.52s)]
*  You know, you've got macro pressures that are requiring not, you know, innovation. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1691.72s)]
*  It's not a it's not a, you know, it's not a not a vitamin. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1696.24s)]
*  It's a painkiller, you know, at this point. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1699.24s)]
*  So I'm very optimistic. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1700.8s)]
*  You know, again, I think we're still the beginning. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1703.68s)]
*  I think the next, you know, the next two decades are just going to be [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1704.88s)]
*  extraordinary. And we need to make it happen. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1707.36s)]
*  Well, it's amazing because not only have you co-founded a model [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1708.8s)]
*  to basically help co-found this whole ecosystem. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1711.08s)]
*  Right. And that's what needed to be done. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1713.72s)]
*  Very, very generous. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1715.44s)]
*  You know, you know, and thank you for being a partner. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1716.56s)]
*  And it's reason for being a partner along the line. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1719.24s)]
*  Oh, no, it's our pleasure. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1720.72s)]
*  Obviously, you think a ton about health care. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1722.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, what do you do for the health? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1723.52s)]
*  So I have two kids, a four year old and a two year old. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1725.16s)]
*  Jim called Lifetime opened up near my home and I begged [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1727.32s)]
*  I would have paid any price to sign up because they have childcare [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1732.16s)]
*  for two and a half hours. Oh, wow. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1734.76s)]
*  It's a deal you can't refuse. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1736.24s)]
*  Offer you can't. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1738.1200000000001s)]
*  So we've been joking. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1739.28s)]
*  I'm going to be the best shape of my luck because, you know, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1739.8s)]
*  I mean, you're busy as an entrepreneur and childcare is so precious. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1741.92s)]
*  And the kids love it. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1744.4s)]
*  So we we call it the Family Fund Center. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1745.24s)]
*  And that's not excellent. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1747.44s)]
*  Not Lifetime, Jim, but we. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1748.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, I got a push notification from Lifetime that said, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1749.92s)]
*  like, congratulations on your, you know, your 25th visit. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1752.92s)]
*  And I looked up how long I've been open. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1756.44s)]
*  It was like 45 days. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1758.0s)]
*  That's excellent. Excellent. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1759.3600000000001s)]
*  It's funny, I try to be like similar to Omada. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1760.68s)]
*  Omada is pragmatic relative to, you know, what fits into your world [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1763.52s)]
*  and what best kind of fits into your life and tend to not be overly zealous [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1766.88s)]
*  one way or the other, but just try to, you know, abide by healthy food habits. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1770.44s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1773.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you so much for joining us on Raising Health. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1774.72s)]
*  Thank you for allowing me to be the first guest on this new instantiation. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1776.88s)]
*  Thank you. All right. Take care, BJ. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKbvKfj5qn4&t=1781.04s)]
