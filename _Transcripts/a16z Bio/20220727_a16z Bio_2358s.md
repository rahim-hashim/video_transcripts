Video Description: 5 leading digital health founders - from GoodRx, Headway, Incredible Health, Komodo, and Owkin - on how to build multi-sided networks in healthcare.
Multi-sided network businesses are connecting our fragmented and siloed healthcare system in fundamentally new ways. Founders are using this go-to-market strategy as a creative and efficient way of getting their technology innovation to their target customers — patients, providers, payors, pharma/biotechs, and/or pharmacies. However, it can be complex to execute. 
Vineeta Agarwala and Jay Rughani spoke with digital health builders — from GoodRx, Headway, Incredible Health, Komodo Health, Owkin — who are meeting the challenge of setting up these complex but resilient business models.

# Two-Sided Networks in Healthcare - a Founder's Playbook
**a16z Bio:** [July 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM)
*  Hi, everyone. I'm Vinito. And I'm Jay. We're both part of the health and bioinvesting team [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=0.0s)]
*  here at Andreessen Horowitz. And welcome back to chapter three of our series on evolving [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=24.84s)]
*  go-to-market motions in the very exciting world of digital health. In the two earlier [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=29.04s)]
*  videos in the series, Jay and Julie explored a strategy that we called B2C2B. And then [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  Justin and Julie analyzed another increasingly prominent strategy of risk-based contracting [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=39.48s)]
*  in the world of value-based care. Today, in episode three, we're going to chat about yet [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=44.4s)]
*  another go-to-market strategy, which is to build a two-sided network in healthcare. And [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=48.64s)]
*  so in this playbook, we're going to explore what is a two-sided network really, how and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=53.36s)]
*  why are so many digital health builders, five of whom we're going to highlight today in short [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=58.0s)]
*  clips, choosing to invest in the growth of two-sided networks. And lastly, we'll share how we as [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=62.72s)]
*  investors evaluate two-sided network businesses ourselves and how we think about their future [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=68.48s)]
*  as very exciting, impactful, attractive, large businesses. So let's kick off by defining [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=73.6s)]
*  network. At the end of the day, a network is a group of interconnected transacting parties. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=79.28s)]
*  That could be businesses, that could be people and companies, patients and providers. Today, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=84.08s)]
*  when we think of really well-connected integrated networks, healthcare isn't usually the first [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  industry that comes to mind. We think of healthcare instead as this unfortunately fragmented siloed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=94.56s)]
*  world where data is stuck in one part of the industry and can't flow freely to other parts. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=99.92s)]
*  Now there are nuances in gray areas, but the five major constituents of the healthcare industry are [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=105.12s)]
*  what we like to sometimes call the five Ps. There are the pharma companies, also known to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=109.76s)]
*  a broader extent as life sciences companies. They build the products that could be drugs, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  diagnostic tests. There are pharmacies, that's the supply chain people, companies who are ultimately [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  selling those products to end users. There are providers, those are the doctors, nurses, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=125.84s)]
*  health systems, hospitals, the infrastructure by which we actually do care delivery, which leverages [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=131.44s)]
*  those life sciences products to help patients. There are payers, the group that pay for healthcare [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=137.92s)]
*  services that could include insurance companies, that could include Medicare, that could include [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=143.6s)]
*  self-insured employers. Finally, there are patients, the people that all of these entities [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  collectively try to serve as the healthcare ecosystem. Oftentimes, these five Ps struggle [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=153.04s)]
*  to connect or to transact really seamlessly with each other. That's exactly the problem actually, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=160.16s)]
*  that two-sided network businesses in healthcare are often tackling. They're building those channels, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=166.0s)]
*  those connections between major players in the healthcare industry and often data reinforces [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=170.32s)]
*  those connections. Now let's take a minute to discuss what makes a two-sided network actually [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=175.84s)]
*  work and how it's different from a company with two distinct business units. The two are similar [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=181.36s)]
*  in that both execute one distinct go-to-market motion for each customer set, but here's what [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=186.8s)]
*  makes a two-sided network different. The company is building a product that is valuable to one set [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=192.32s)]
*  of customers and the delivery of that product to those customers allows them to do something else [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=197.44s)]
*  for an entirely different set of customers. When one company successfully executes two independent [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=203.84s)]
*  go-to-market motions in parallel, a powerful network effect kicks in and each go-to-market [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=209.84s)]
*  motion becomes easier because the other exists. In short, one plus one is greater than two and the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  business becomes greater than the sum of its parts. Let's look at some examples of two-sided [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=221.92s)]
*  networks to build a little bit of intuition on what this go-to-market motion means and what it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  can enable. A canonical network business we all know is Google. Google is a business that indirectly [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=233.27999999999997s)]
*  connects consumers, the first side of their business, with a vast universe of advertisers [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  on the other side. On the consumer side, we all know that they've built a suite of products and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  services that meet our needs as consumers from search engines to email tools to business tools. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  And then separately for advertisers, they've also built a suite of product services analytics that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=256.64s)]
*  underpin their advertising business and that take advantage of all the knowledge that comes from the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=261.92s)]
*  consumer side of their business. And the key is that these two business arms depend intrinsically [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=266.8s)]
*  on one another. The advertising business only works if it can leverage the deep reach into the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=271.52s)]
*  consumer world that Google has and the consumer business can't live or sustain itself without the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=277.76s)]
*  funding that comes from the advertising business. And so both sides of this network become [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  self-reinforcing parts of the overall Google business because of the data really that flows [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=287.52s)]
*  through the channel that Google has created by indirectly connecting these two different [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=293.92s)]
*  go-to-market motions. So that was a consumer internet example. Let's now talk about a health [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=298.24s)]
*  care example that Vanita and I both experienced through our time at Flatiron Health. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=303.76s)]
*  Nat Turner, Zach Weinberg, the founders of Flatiron, and the incredible team built a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=308.32s)]
*  groundbreaking two-sided network business to organize the world's cancer data. The basis for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=312.64s)]
*  Flatiron was the observation that there's a lot of data generated every single day by oncology care [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=318.08s)]
*  providers from patient symptoms, whether and how they respond to drugs, even the genomic profile of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=323.52s)]
*  tumors. Now, pharmaceutical companies really want to learn from this exact kind of data to make [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=329.04s)]
*  oncology drug discovery, development, and distribution better and more efficient. So Flatiron Health [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=335.44s)]
*  built a two-sided network that connected these stakeholders, health care providers on one side [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  of the business and pharmaceutical companies on the other, by first building a suite of deeply [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=346.56s)]
*  integrated software products to help providers take care of their patients. At the same time, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  they created tools to clean and analyze that data and turn it into a format and structure that's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=357.6s)]
*  useful for drug development. Much like in the Google example, the two sides of the business [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=363.36s)]
*  aren't directly transacting with one another, but the data streams from each side reinforce one [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  another. So why are we seeing the rise of a two-sided network go-to-market strategy? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  We think there are at least three tailwinds playing out over the last several years, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=379.12s)]
*  which are accelerating this trend and make it durable. First, there's more health care data [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=382.88s)]
*  in a digital format than there ever was before. Almost 95% of care providers have adopted [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=388.0s)]
*  electronic health records in the last decade since the High Tech Act in 2009. Over 35% of all the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=392.88s)]
*  world's data is actually generated in the process of delivering health care. We have all this data [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=399.36s)]
*  now about patients and health records, their diagnostic tests, patient reported outcomes, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=405.2s)]
*  claims, and much more. The health industry leaves a very rich data trail. All this data now exists [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=409.6s)]
*  and is digitized. That's the first trend. The second is that this data is actually more [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=416.8s)]
*  commonly stored in the cloud. Despite privacy concerns about health care data, many, many [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=421.36s)]
*  providers, hospitals, clinics, labs, EHR vendors, all that data is actually living in Google Cloud [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  or on AWS rather than on an on-prem server in the basement of your hospital. That means that that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=432.88s)]
*  data is more accessible and easier to share, to analyze across the entire industry. The final [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=438.88s)]
*  trend that we think is important is that our tools and capabilities to process, transform, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=445.92s)]
*  and analyze this data has also improved. Our partners have written about this in Emerging [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=451.84s)]
*  Architectures for the Modern Data Infrastructure Stack. That's an interesting read. I encourage [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=458.32s)]
*  you to check it out. But the industry for those tools is not just focused on a particular [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=463.36s)]
*  application. It's universally enabling and health care data is no exception. Not only do we have a [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=469.68s)]
*  lot more data, we also have incredible tools that allow us to learn from that data more rapidly. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  This really is a perfect environment for entrepreneurs to ask, how do I exploit that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=480.64s)]
*  possibility that I can use data to build connectivity between otherwise siloed parts [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  of the industry? Two-sided networks look pretty interesting in that light. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=491.12s)]
*  While two-sided networks can be more complex to execute, founders who choose this go-to-market [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=496.4s)]
*  strategy are typically addressing at least one of three situations in which it can be worth the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=501.12s)]
*  effort. One, broken data flows between two or more sets of constituents. In this scenario, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=506.0s)]
*  one party is interested in insights from another party, but this data isn't flowing frequently [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=512.72s)]
*  between them, typically because there aren't software rails in between them. Or alternatively, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=517.52s)]
*  one party wants to collaborate with the other and needs an efficient channel for engagement. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=522.24s)]
*  The startup becomes that connecting bridge. Two, severe fragmentation in a market that makes it [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=526.96s)]
*  difficult for users to access, navigate, or transact with the other side. The interface in [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=533.76s)]
*  this scenario is the marketplace, which aggregates that fragmented ecosystem and makes it more [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  accessible to other parties. Three, highly elastic demand whereby you have consumers who really need [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=544.88s)]
*  and are willing to use a certain product or service, but where monetizing directly either [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=552.48s)]
*  isn't feasible or would slow down adoption or damage retention prohibitively. So, finding a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=557.36s)]
*  sustainable business model elsewhere can make a lot of sense. There is no perfect right way to build [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=563.92s)]
*  a two-sided network business in healthcare and life sciences. It's still very much a growing, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=569.6s)]
*  evolving strategy. We're fortunate to have spoken with so many founders choosing this approach, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=573.92s)]
*  and we'll share some of our learnings, as well as interview clips from five exceptional founders [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  in particular about how they approach building their businesses in hope that our learnings help [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=583.68s)]
*  you build your companies. When you're building a business with a two-sided network strategy, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=588.7199999999999s)]
*  it's often not obvious which side of the business to start with first. We heard from Arif Nthu, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=594.0s)]
*  CEO and co-founder of Komodo Health, which is overcoming broken data flows with a two-sided [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=599.36s)]
*  network connecting life sciences companies on the first side and providers, payers, and pharmacies [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=604.72s)]
*  on the second side. He described how they started with the demand side, targeting a very narrow set [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=609.6s)]
*  of users, but delighting them relative to their very best next alternative. I think every tech [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=615.04s)]
*  company should start with the demand side. So, we actually picked a very specific audience within [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  life sciences, which were these folks in medical affairs teams. Medical affairs teams are responsible [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=627.92s)]
*  for non-promotional scientific exchange, which basically means having scientific conversations [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=633.5999999999999s)]
*  with doctors. We said their needs were really gated by a lack of visibility into a provider's [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  overall practice. So, you can get lots of information on what doctors are publishing. You can see what [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  clinical trials they're running. But what you lack is a really deep insight to where they are in the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=653.2800000000001s)]
*  care journey of a patient. We thought, hey, if we could bring really, really good insight to that, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=658.88s)]
*  we could serve this one little niche really well. That's how we started the business. We served [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=664.48s)]
*  one population and through that, we built one application. That application, we sold to that [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=669.36s)]
*  one buyer type. The business really grew from there, but it all started out because we really [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=675.12s)]
*  wanted to get one thing right. Alternatively, we heard from Andrew Adams, CEO and co-founder [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=681.36s)]
*  at Headway, which is overcoming fragmentation with a multi-sided network that connects patients with [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=686.96s)]
*  mental health care providers and health insurers. He described how they focused on the supply side [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=692.16s)]
*  first, in their case, mental health care providers, because of their insight that their market was [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=697.2s)]
*  fundamentally supply constrained. Yeah, this was particularly core during the early couple [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=702.0s)]
*  years of Headway that we very clearly had a patient oriented mission. We're building a new [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=707.2s)]
*  mental health care system that everyone can access. But then our means of delivery and our [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=711.36s)]
*  strategic focus was very particularly on the therapist, which is the scarcest entity in the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  space. It's the scarcest asset in the space. It is really hard for payers to work with fragmented [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=720.96s)]
*  providers, of which they feel like there's not enough of them. It's really hard for the patient [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=726.48s)]
*  to find a provider. So we had a very crystal clear clarity, particularly early on. And again, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=730.24s)]
*  I'm just claiming early on because once you do this, you have an opportunity to evolve and do [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=734.96s)]
*  more. But very early on, we had the unambiguous clarity of the therapist being our customer. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=739.12s)]
*  We framed our demand generation as activation rate for our supply side. So we very, very rigorously [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=744.24s)]
*  filter things through that lens of building for the provider. And if you look in terms of [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=752.0s)]
*  technically what we delivered, we did all sorts of things that no patient would ever raise their [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=756.08s)]
*  hand, say, I want that. No patient has ever been like, you know what, I'd love to find a way to [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=760.24s)]
*  find a provider online. But first and foremost, I got to vet how good their claims engine is, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=765.84s)]
*  or I want to see how good their credentialing engine is. But that stuff is really important [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  to be able to scalably build for the provider to have something that money just appears, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=774.48s)]
*  credentialing just happens. And so we built the best claims engine, we built the best credentialing [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=779.2s)]
*  engine, we built the best benefit interpretation engine in the country, regardless of specialty, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=784.32s)]
*  because we built it from tech from the get go, focused on our vertical mental health. And so [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=788.8s)]
*  we did all these things that were focused on getting active providers that ultimately to serve [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  our patient mission involved focusing rigorously on the supply side. And to make things more complex, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  we hear some go after both sides in parallel. We heard from Iman Abouzade, CEO and co founder of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  incredible health, which is addressing fragmentation between healthcare workers, specifically nurse [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=811.12s)]
*  practitioners and employers. She described how they were able to go after both sides right away [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=816.08s)]
*  by applying a focus constraint on geography for an initial period before scaling. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=822.24s)]
*  Yeah, so we started with both we went after supply and demand at the same time, but we stayed [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=827.6s)]
*  geographically very focused, like many other two sided marketplaces. When we started, we were only [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=832.72s)]
*  live in the San Francisco Bay Area. And so when you sort of restrict your market like that, it [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=838.88s)]
*  becomes a lot more manageable to get supply and demand. And you can really figure out your playbooks [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=843.52s)]
*  for how you're going to get supply and demand. So our first key takeaway is that whether you start [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=848.0799999999999s)]
*  on the demand side, the supply side, or a limited version of both, it's best to focus on the most [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=852.56s)]
*  constrained aspect of the market to jumpstart the network. And regardless of who you start with, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=858.24s)]
*  trust needs to be the foundation. We talked to Thomas Clauzel, CEO and co founder of Okan, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=864.0s)]
*  which is building research infrastructure for both care providers on the first side [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=869.5200000000001s)]
*  and biopharma companies on the second side. He emphasized the importance of building trust [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=873.44s)]
*  with their first users, in their case, hospitals. We first, we really built this trust about people [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=878.6400000000001s)]
*  saying, this is cool. You see medicine, you don't see product, you don't see data, you don't see [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=884.24s)]
*  cash. And he really felt important because we were working with physicians, you know. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=888.72s)]
*  So I think that the trust was really the first layer that keeps you also, you know, like doing [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=892.8000000000001s)]
*  keeping this, all these hospitals are working with us, years after years. And GoodRx took a very [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  similar approach of addressing fragmentation between individual consumers on one side and [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=903.9200000000001s)]
*  manufacturers and pharmacies on the other. CEO and co founder Doug Hirsch shared with us how they [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=908.8000000000001s)]
*  built trust with their patient users early on to drive adoption and grow the business. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=914.1600000000001s)]
*  It's really, really hard to change people's behavior. And they're looking for a reason to [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=919.2800000000001s)]
*  be like, I don't trust this new thing, or they're up to no good, or who knows what. And so [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=922.1600000000001s)]
*  we wanted to just come up with a, I mean, if you look at GoodRx, the core of GoodRx, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=926.56s)]
*  back in 2012, it was, you know, a search box, you know, price page and a coupon, right? And we took [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=930.16s)]
*  great effort to make sure that, you know, it was just as easy as possible for someone to get in. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=936.88s)]
*  The prices that we showed were accurate. It worked when you showed up at the pharmacy, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=941.3599999999999s)]
*  we put a tremendous amount of effort into, we call it patient advocacy here, but that's really [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=945.1199999999999s)]
*  customer care to others. And we have sort of that Zappos model of like, just call us for anything, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=948.8s)]
*  we'll do our best to solve it for you and do it right. So these two stories illustrate our second [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=953.28s)]
*  key takeaway, that trust is essential for building the first side with the strong foundation to [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=958.72s)]
*  enable future sides of the business. So once you've identified your initial users, how do you go about [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=964.48s)]
*  engaging them? We consistently heard an emphasis on identifying single user utility before highlighting [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=970.16s)]
*  the future network. Doug at GoodRx shared with us how they started with an ultra simple product [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=976.88s)]
*  and limited the friction of using GoodRx. I'm the guy who's used to just building incredible [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=982.56s)]
*  products without any marketing budget. And if the product is great, people will come and if it's not, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=988.4s)]
*  they won't, right? And I kind of believe that to this day, we have a very significant marketing [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=992.64s)]
*  department, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing, but I still ultimately [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=996.16s)]
*  believe that, you know, you should be driving a significant amount of your traffic organically, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=999.68s)]
*  because you should be providing a product that provides enough value that people are going to [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1003.52s)]
*  tell their friends about it. V1 of GoodRx, which we launched at Health 2.0 in San Francisco back in [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1007.28s)]
*  2010, 2011, was kind of a fake website, to be honest, right? It was, we called, I think Costco [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1012.0s)]
*  published prices on their website. Apparently in New York state, you can demand a price list, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1019.44s)]
*  although I challenge you to do that because any firms will look at you like you're crazy when you [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1025.04s)]
*  do that. You know, and we just cobbled, we had people calling places, we asked our friends what [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1028.24s)]
*  price they were paying for certain meds. We just cobbled something together, threw it up there, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1034.16s)]
*  and then we presented at this conference and there was a voting mechanism at this conference. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1038.64s)]
*  And we came in second place to a much more well-known brand at the time. I think we also [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1042.8000000000002s)]
*  made the decision early on to not require registration, which, you know, one of the biggest [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1047.8400000000001s)]
*  downsides of most of the health products that are out there, especially like your own insurance [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1053.2s)]
*  company, is, you know, it requires such onerous identification and setup in order for someone to [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1057.2s)]
*  use the product that people just don't bother. And especially when we're asking someone to take a [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1061.68s)]
*  flyer on something so important, right? This is about your care and prescription, something so [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1065.68s)]
*  personal. And, you know, we thought, well, okay, let's help you, you know, start a search. Well, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1069.8400000000001s)]
*  then, you know, help you spell the name of that drug and we'll immediately take you to prices of [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1074.72s)]
*  pharmacies you recognize. We're not going to ask you to sign up. We're not going to ask you to [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1078.5600000000002s)]
*  authenticate yourself and do all these crazy things. I'm not going to ask you to pay even, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1081.6000000000001s)]
*  obviously. Similarly, Iman and Incredible Health shared with us the manual matching they did through [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  their personal networks for the first cohort of users in absence of not having the other side of [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1091.28s)]
*  the network fully built. Well, we spent some time understanding their problems and we discovered that, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1096.08s)]
*  you know, nurses and other healthcare workers have a terrible job search experience. They apply to [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1101.44s)]
*  10, 15 places. They don't even hear back if they hear and they describe it as a black hole. And even [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1106.56s)]
*  when they do hear back, it can take, it can still take months. And so when we described the main [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1111.6s)]
*  value proposition, like, hey, the employers are going to apply to you instead of you applying to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1116.48s)]
*  them, that was a very appealing value prop to them. I think the first 30 or 40 nurses we just [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1120.24s)]
*  recruited through our networks, frankly, there was no software like you said to your point, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1126.56s)]
*  and just really used that value proposition of, hey, employers are going to apply to you instead [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1131.92s)]
*  of you applying to them as the main message. And that got the first, you know, 50 to 100 nurses on [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1136.8s)]
*  our platform. In a slightly different approach, Thomas at Okun shared with us how they built [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1142.8s)]
*  trust with their early users by offering subsidized professional services in the form of custom [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1147.6s)]
*  analytic projects and co-publishing the results with their customers and academic journals, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1152.8s)]
*  all before getting to monetization. With this value proposition about we're going to work with [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1157.6s)]
*  the hospitals. We came to them saying, we're not going to take your data. We don't want to take [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1161.92s)]
*  your data out. We want to help you curate these data sets. We want to help you making big breakthrough, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1166.08s)]
*  big discoveries with our data science team. And we have an excellent one. And we want to publish [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1171.12s)]
*  with you. We want to do great stuff. We started like that. Let's work together. Let's try to find [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1175.68s)]
*  things that have not been discovered before. And then we started to make projects, start with one [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1179.68s)]
*  center. Curie was the first in France. Then we go a few others coming in. And we came with this idea [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1184.0800000000002s)]
*  and we started to publish, make projects, discover where our technology was the most efficient, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1190.48s)]
*  and start to try to federate these centers together as well and build these federated [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1195.76s)]
*  learning projects. So this brings us to our third key takeaway, which is that every founder emphasized [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1199.68s)]
*  starting with a narrow gaze of solving a single core problem for your initial users. Practically [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1204.48s)]
*  no founder we speak with feels like they optimize pricing, especially in the early days on the first [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1210.0s)]
*  side of their business. One common theme we heard though, was that on the first side, the goal is to [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  optimize for customer feedback and engagement rather than solely on near-term economics. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1220.16s)]
*  As one example, Okun focused on building trust with their provider customers and set their pricing [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1225.92s)]
*  model accordingly. They didn't want hospitals to pay for their software and so they developed [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1230.8s)]
*  a revenue sharing model accordingly. Then came our third value. We don't want to have providers. We [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1235.52s)]
*  don't want to have hospitals pay. What we want to do is enrich the academic system we're coming from. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1241.76s)]
*  We want to help it. We want to make it grow. So we knew that. And knowing that, we knew that we would [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1247.52s)]
*  never try to make hospitals pay. It's not a great business anyway to try to make hospitals pay. Some [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1253.12s)]
*  others do really well, but we didn't want to do it and it didn't felt right. And so we came to the [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1257.2s)]
*  things that we need to find a win-win model with them. And the win-win model was, you know, we're [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1262.48s)]
*  going to give you this technology, our platform, we're going to help you on the data science side, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1266.32s)]
*  we're going to help you curate data. No, we also even generate data, single cell data, special [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1271.44s)]
*  transcriptomic, really high quality data sets that don't have. And we'll revenue share with you, you [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1275.44s)]
*  know, up to 10% usually. So that's kind of the main thing. And that's the model was a really [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1280.64s)]
*  win-win model. This story echoes what we've heard from many founders as well, that it's key to price [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1286.64s)]
*  for engagement and learning to inform future product development on both sides. Ultimately, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1291.6000000000001s)]
*  there's so much nuance in each market such that your go-to-market journey is going to vary case [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1296.88s)]
*  by case. But we asked founders what metrics they looked at to gauge whether they were on the right [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1301.5200000000002s)]
*  track forward. For RFID Komodo, they anchored to a particular qualitative metric, which they called [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1306.88s)]
*  moments of truth, above all the traditional quantitative enterprise SaaS metrics that they, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1312.24s)]
*  of course, looked at as well. I'm basing my pricing to value, I need to base my product metrics to [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1316.8s)]
*  value. That's really hard for product because I can't look at a, you know, a session and, you know, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1323.6s)]
*  say, are they getting value from that session if all I'm looking at is, you know, how they're [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1329.28s)]
*  clicking through or the amount of time they're spending in the app. And so what we focused on [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1333.6s)]
*  instead for our product team were moments of truth. The customer needs something. How am I [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1338.32s)]
*  driving that value better, faster, and more efficiently than anyone else? And so those [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1344.72s)]
*  moments of truth are actually what we found were highly predictive of outcomes. And so actually, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1352.3999999999999s)]
*  our product team invested in running QBRs with every one of our customers, even when we were tiny. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1358.24s)]
*  And yes, utilization metrics are part of it. But more importantly, the stories around how the [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1364.8s)]
*  customer was driving value in their business from our product became the actual primary way for them [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1370.32s)]
*  to make those calls. And so they would look at that and say, okay, there were like six moments [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1376.08s)]
*  of truth and we served all of them. And then we shared that with the customer and the customer [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1381.2s)]
*  got really excited. And then they said, okay, here's what we're going to do next quarter. And so [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1385.9199999999998s)]
*  it allowed them to start to build their relationship in a deeper way with us. We measure [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1389.52s)]
*  ourselves on that revenue retention, dollar revenue retention, whatever sort of retention [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1394.0s)]
*  metric, which is factors in essentially your gross churn combined with your upsell. And so every one [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1398.0s)]
*  of these QBRs is not just an opportunity to get a renewal. It's an opportunity to get an expansion, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1404.16s)]
*  expand to another team, expand to another product that may suit some of the product needs that the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1408.72s)]
*  team has. So we don't think of these as just get the renewal. We think of it as what is the [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1415.12s)]
*  relationship that allows us to grow our presence with that team across the entire commotive suite [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1421.12s)]
*  of products. Andrew described how Headway focused on one North Star quantitative metric, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1428.0s)]
*  but then changed the North Star metric as the company matured through different stages. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1432.8799999999999s)]
*  Early on in our company's development, we prioritize how many active providers we had, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1437.36s)]
*  which is active supply side users. We really, really privileged that. And indeed, much like [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1442.08s)]
*  the development of marketplaces, once you really corner supply and we built the best supply [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1447.04s)]
*  acquisition engine, we were bigger, faster than any would-be competitor. Then we really knew [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1452.56s)]
*  as well for some other strategic inputs that it was a time to think about not just cornering and [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1459.36s)]
*  having a North Star metric be supply units, but a derivative of GMV, which for us is appointment, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1464.24s)]
*  supply and demand intersecting. So our fifth takeaway is to find your North Star metric, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1470.1599999999999s)]
*  whether it's qualitative or quantitative, and then be willing to adjust that metric as your [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1474.96s)]
*  company evolves. But we heard many examples of metrics being misleading without context. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1479.68s)]
*  So the key is to diligently pick the ones that actually drive business value for your network. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1485.44s)]
*  For good RX, who would look at aggregate traffic and page rank among other things, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1490.88s)]
*  external changes could really skew those. We looked at our page rank because we are obviously [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1495.44s)]
*  primarily an organic-based company. And so we wanted to make sure that no one really occupied [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1502.0s)]
*  drug name plus price. And so we wanted to make sure that we were filling that void and that we [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1507.2s)]
*  could actually make some headway by just answering that question again for both consumers and [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1513.92s)]
*  physicians. And so I think obviously we looked at aggregate traffic, we looked at page rank, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1518.56s)]
*  we looked at claims. So let's say Google suddenly decided that we were the best option for [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1522.96s)]
*  lisinopril, which is just a drug. But lisinopril, the head term, not lisinopril plus price. And so [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1528.16s)]
*  all of a sudden our lisinopril traffic would go through the roof, but of course so would our bounce [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1533.0400000000002s)]
*  rate, because people would come in and they actually looking for side effects of lisinopril [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1536.24s)]
*  or they were looking for interactions with lisinopril or should I take it if I'm pregnant or [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1539.2s)]
*  who knows what. And so those could be sometimes confusing. They also, of course, blow out your [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1542.88s)]
*  metrics because now you're the head term and you're the number one search result and all of a sudden [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1548.4s)]
*  it skews things. So you have to be careful because remember I came from the world of social. I was [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1551.3600000000001s)]
*  at Facebook and Yahoo where time spent was like the God metric. It was like, oh my God, we just [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1556.88s)]
*  care about as many eyeballs and as much time as we can. And it could directly, it's less about time [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1561.6000000000001s)]
*  spent. It's really more about making sure the consumer gets a positive outcome and they're able [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1566.16s)]
*  to find a great resolution. In general, just looking at top of funnel metrics can be very [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1570.5600000000002s)]
*  misleading if we're not looking at the middle and the bottom of the funnel in terms of what you [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1576.8000000000002s)]
*  actually, the activity you actually want to happen. A vanity metric is just looking at the overall [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1581.1200000000001s)]
*  number of talent on the platform because it doesn't really matter if there's a thousand, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1586.08s)]
*  10,000, a million, millions of healthcare workers on the platform if they're not engaged, if they [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1593.6s)]
*  don't have their profiles completed and if they're not being put in front of employers. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1599.9199999999998s)]
*  And so our last takeaway for building the first side of your network is to be mindful of the North [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1603.28s)]
*  Star metric you choose and especially to watch out for those vanity metrics. So after establishing [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1608.0s)]
*  the first side of the business, founders then have to start thinking about how to turn the data [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1613.76s)]
*  stream from the first side of the business to drive the second side's growth. Once you have that [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1618.0s)]
*  core, then the question is how can you use it to the benefit of the folks who will provide you the [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1623.12s)]
*  next set of insights? And so we actually took that core and we built a lot of insights that helped [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1629.28s)]
*  um uh you know folks that that that see patient journeys like providers like payers and by doing [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1635.52s)]
*  that um gave them a reason to both contribute to us and as well take something from us. In fact, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1642.32s)]
*  it might even be the case that the data stream and engagement that a business has curated is so good [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  that the second side of the business comes to you. We had a number of manufacturers call us up. I [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1653.36s)]
*  had one very senior manufacturer at a C level executive at a major manufacturer call us up and [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1657.28s)]
*  say like this system's just broken. You guys have the eyeballs. We want to get in front of the people [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1663.84s)]
*  you know so that we can tell them about our drug and give them the tools like patient assistance [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1668.32s)]
*  programs and manufacturer discounts but we want to go direct. We want to just end run this whole [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1671.76s)]
*  messy system and so we knew there was an opportunity here when we were getting those [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1676.48s)]
*  kind of phone calls. Now whether you have some inbound demand for the second side of your [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1679.92s)]
*  business or not, you likely still need to do the cycles of customer pain point discovery and product [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1683.76s)]
*  iteration which you successfully did on the first side of your business in order to succeed in the [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1689.36s)]
*  second motion. GoodRx was quite disciplined in their approach here. We just started slowly [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1693.6799999999998s)]
*  calling up manufacturers and saying hey look we've got more people sitting on the GoodRx [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1699.12s)]
*  slash whatever drug name page than you have at whateverdrugname.com. So what do you want to say [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1703.04s)]
*  to those people? And you start the basic stuff. You start with the same ads that you see on the [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1708.24s)]
*  golf channel and stuff like that but then we start thinking about way more sophisticated programs. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1711.84s)]
*  We have a program right now where we actually have a nurse, a live 24-7 nurse chat sitting on [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1716.3200000000002s)]
*  a drug page so you can actually talk to a nurse about the drug. We have again integration of [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1720.64s)]
*  patient assistance programs so if you just simply can't afford it they have these incredible [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1725.28s)]
*  programs that will bring down the cost to as much as zero. We have all sorts of integrations [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1728.8000000000002s)]
*  that ultimately are focused on connecting that provider who traditionally does not have a great [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1733.68s)]
*  relationship, doesn't really know the patient because they're very divorced from it. They often [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1737.92s)]
*  have a drug that you can't even pronounce that they can't necessarily connect with the patient [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1742.56s)]
*  and we're the glue. We're the glue that can be in the middle. Now it can be daunting and potentially [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1746.48s)]
*  distracting to start again on a new side as the first side of the business is really taking off [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1750.6399999999999s)]
*  but focusing on finding product market fit in the new segment can drive stickiness for both sides of [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1755.9199999999998s)]
*  the network. Incredible Health found that product expansion surfaced more ideas for further product [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1760.96s)]
*  expansion which surfaced more ideas for product expansion which continues to fuel their growth [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1766.3999999999999s)]
*  today. So product expansion in a two-sided marketplace is probably one of the most effective [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1771.2s)]
*  things you can do to drive growth and to drive your own and to drive a company's defensibility [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1779.04s)]
*  too and to drive delightful user experiences. So I'll talk about it on the talent side and on the [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1783.8400000000001s)]
*  employer side. So on the talent side it was very important that we're not just the place where a [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1788.96s)]
*  nurse and eventually other healthcare workers find a job. We need to be do more than that. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1793.6000000000001s)]
*  From a product standpoint we need to have a career-long relationship with them. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1798.6399999999999s)]
*  So we do offer free continuing education to every single nurse in the country. We have free salary [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1802.6399999999999s)]
*  estimators for every single nurse in the country. We have an advice platform or a community built [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1807.76s)]
*  into our apps where nurses can give each other highly personalized advice. It's like a core [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1811.9199999999998s)]
*  of our nurses and we continue to add more and more of these services. In addition to that [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1815.6s)]
*  we have our customer support team offers interview preparation, helps with resume guides and so on. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1823.76s)]
*  I think the more value that we drive to the talent, the more first of all the more join us [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1831.4399999999998s)]
*  and then the more stay with us. It's a huge driver of user acquisition and engagement [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1837.6s)]
*  on the talent side. Now the same is true on the employer side. We incorrectly thought in our [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1841.9199999999998s)]
*  early days if we deliver the talent we're good to go. We can just move on and no it turns out [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1849.44s)]
*  that we actually have to build quite a lot of b2b workflow software for the employers. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1854.16s)]
*  In an automatic interview scheduling, in-app chat between the talent and the employers. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1859.3600000000001s)]
*  We had to build in SMS technology. We had to share like a robust set of data analytics so they can [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1865.28s)]
*  benchmark themselves against their competitors who are also using the platform so they can improve [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1873.04s)]
*  their internal hiring operations. So when it comes to building out the second side of your network, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1877.36s)]
*  our first takeaway is to repeat the product discovery and iteration process that your [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1881.76s)]
*  organization executed so effectively before in order to find product market fit again. But again [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1886.1599999999999s)]
*  excess complexity can start to creep up. Keeping it simple and familiar can drive adoption and [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1891.9199999999998s)]
*  growth tremendously. So to payers we get to transact in a way that's really familiar. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1896.9599999999998s)]
*  Looking like a doctor's office and so even though over time we as part of being more than just a [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1903.1999999999998s)]
*  provider group, we layered on additional pricing complexity and additional product complexity. We [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1908.4799999999998s)]
*  looked really familiar to get paid like a doctor's office gets paid which allows us to in turn pay [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1914.08s)]
*  providers like a doctor's office gets paid. So for providers they do not have to see us as something [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1919.6799999999998s)]
*  that entails a SAS fee. They see patients and then they get paid and there's not any additional [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1925.04s)]
*  auxiliary fees for what we're offering. We get to give away our software to providers for free. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1932.0s)]
*  They get a marketplace where patients can find them. They get a SAS portal where the billing [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1937.12s)]
*  and the scheduling happens in a way where insurance is invisible and then they get paid a straightforward [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1941.84s)]
*  fee for each session. The more complexity there is in pricing the harder it is to close a deal. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1947.36s)]
*  And right now we're in like hyper growth mode. I mean Incredible Health grew 400% last year. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1954.8s)]
*  We're on track to grow another 300-400% this year. And if we don't want to and our priority [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1960.4s)]
*  right now is to you know drive market share and expand as much as we can. And so we kept our [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1967.6000000000001s)]
*  pricing very simple as a result. So as you're iterating it's key to look for any area you can [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1974.16s)]
*  to cut out complexity. Now once you achieve success on both sides you encounter the more [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1979.2800000000002s)]
*  pronounced challenge of keeping both sides happy. Emoned Incredible articulated what we heard from [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1984.0800000000002s)]
*  many about serving both but ultimately being clear about the north star of your network [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1989.76s)]
*  and why that alignment ultimately benefits both sides of your network. This happens all the time. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=1995.28s)]
*  We have employers that ask for exclusivity. They ask can we get them talent first? Can we? And we [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2001.04s)]
*  we always say no to those requests. And we explain that we operate like Switzerland. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2009.2s)]
*  You know like we're neutral and we don't have any preference for one employer over the other. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2016.48s)]
*  And the reason for that is because of the talent. At the end of the day the mission says to help [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2024.0s)]
*  healthcare professionals find and do their best work. And at the end of the day it's up to the [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2027.76s)]
*  talent where they ultimately want to end up being. And we want to maximize the number of opportunities [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2032.96s)]
*  that the talent has. And that's how we get to our third takeaway which is of course to work with all [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2037.8400000000001s)]
*  sides of the networks but to be open and clear about your alignment with one in particular. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2042.4s)]
*  With both sides humming what's next? How do you continue building and growing the business once [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2047.0400000000002s)]
*  both sides are working? Reinforcing one another. The common theme is that you have to find ways to [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2052.4s)]
*  nurture demand for your product. Komodo focused downstream building relationships with professional [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2057.92s)]
*  service providers and brokering channel partnerships which unlock new ways of distribution. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2063.44s)]
*  What's happened over time is that our relationship with these consultants has grown to the point [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2069.04s)]
*  where they're the equivalent of a system integrator in a workflow software setting. Meaning that [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2074.1600000000003s)]
*  they're the ones that actually carry the last mile often for our customers. And so we've made [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2078.8s)]
*  it really easy for them to operate on the Komodo platform. By doing that we give our customers the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2083.92s)]
*  alternative of working with their favorite set of consultants or their favorite sort of integrators. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2089.36s)]
*  And that has actually strengthened our relationship both with the ecosystem as well with our [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2094.0s)]
*  customers so that I don't say no I say guess what here are five companies that you could work with [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2097.84s)]
*  that will take care of this and take care of this on your terms and we work with all of that. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2103.36s)]
*  So our fourth takeaway is to look for potential channels and opportunities to help your customers [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2107.6800000000003s)]
*  use your products. Another interesting insight is from GoodRx who focused on building mini sprint [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2113.04s)]
*  teams to continue launching new products and features to expand their product surface area [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2118.6400000000003s)]
*  across healthcare. So we spend a lot of time and effort on figuring out how to build small squads [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2123.52s)]
*  to take you know take risks try things out that don't necessarily have a direct ROI right now [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2130.96s)]
*  attached to them with a small group so that we can continue to invest in other ways to fix [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2135.6s)]
*  healthcare. I mean the nice thing about healthcare is there's just so many there's so many markets to [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2141.12s)]
*  go into. And this highlights our last key takeaway which is to establish whichever processes are true [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2144.88s)]
*  to your culture to ensure you continue to launch new products over time. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2150.4s)]
*  At E16z we're incredibly optimistic about the scaled impact these multi-sided network businesses [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2161.44s)]
*  can have on our disjointed healthcare system but they're clearly not easy to build. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2167.6800000000003s)]
*  So how do we as investors even go about evaluating businesses like this? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2172.0s)]
*  Well we take each side in turn and we benchmark each side's individual performance to best in [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2175.68s)]
*  class healthcare software businesses. Our firm is written extensively on this but to highlight [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2181.44s)]
*  first we're looking for early indicators of lock-in or product market fit on the first side. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2187.2s)]
*  This spans five elements. Adoption. Are people signing up? We can measure this in account growth, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2193.6s)]
*  user growth, revenue growth, engagement. Are they using it? We can look at time spent in the product, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2200.08s)]
*  number of clicks, number of transactions, number of visits, or whatever the appropriate unit of [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2206.4s)]
*  engagement is to understand engagement frequency and quality. Retention. Are they coming back to [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2210.88s)]
*  the product? How long do they stick with the product? Typically we're looking at retention [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2218.32s)]
*  curves through three, six, twelve months to understand how much your existing customers [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2223.12s)]
*  are fueling your growth and how favorable your acquisition economics are. Efficiency. Is growth [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2227.92s)]
*  getting easier over time? Is your customer acquisition cost going down? Perhaps there's a [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2234.56s)]
*  network effect emerging that is driving word of mouth referrals and decreasing your dependency [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2240.32s)]
*  on paid acquisition. And data access. Are you learning from your users and your product? Are [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2245.2000000000003s)]
*  you sufficiently receiving information through the first side of the business that you're [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2252.48s)]
*  using? Is there a network effect emerging that is driving word of mouth referrals and decreasing [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2256.24s)]
*  your dependency on paid acquisition? Are you learning from your users and your product? Are you [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2260.24s)]
*  receiving information through the first side of the business that enables the subsequent sides of [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2265.84s)]
*  the business? Ultimately, we get excited by signs that it's getting easier to grow the business [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2270.3199999999997s)]
*  over time. Then we look for evidence that the second side of the business is reinforcing the [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2276.72s)]
*  same dimensions of adoption, engagement, retention, as well as the efficiency of that growth. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2282.48s)]
*  But here we have the added lens of looking for qualitative examples of customer use cases that [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2287.6800000000003s)]
*  are only possible because of the first side of the business. And across both, we want to understand [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2292.8s)]
*  your theory of defensibility. Both from disintermediation between the constituents [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2298.64s)]
*  you're connecting, as well as from margin or take rate compression on each side as any one [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2303.28s)]
*  constituents gain share or you have new competition. Some of this will look slightly different, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2308.48s)]
*  whether you monetize via SaaS fees on each side or via per transaction marketplace model, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2313.84s)]
*  but at a high level, these are some of the ways we look to understand these types of businesses. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2319.52s)]
*  Thank you all again for listening and thank you to the founders who contributed their hard earned [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtCzPwqkNgM&t=2324.08s)]
