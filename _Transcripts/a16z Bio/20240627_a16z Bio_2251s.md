# Grand Challenges in Healthcare AI with Vijay Pande and Julie Yoo
**a16z Bio:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwQP0zAsQEs)
*  So Vijay, you and I talk about the fact all the time that health care is an industry that used to be intractable with respect to the adoption of technology.
*  But we are also super optimistic that health care is now potentially one of the biggest beneficiaries of technology in the form of AI.
*  And so we wanted to riff about some of the grand challenges that we see for builders in the health care AI space.
*  And so let's actually start just with your sort of high level thoughts on where do you think AI will make the biggest difference in health care immediately?
*  Yeah, the immediate least hard part of the question, right? Because if we talk about the 20-year arc, I think a lot can happen.
*  So the immediate part is an issue of both technology and also people, right? What will people accept? What will people adopt?
*  And in many ways, I think when you think about the history of technology and health care, who will buy it? Who will incorporate it? How will it work into doctors workflows?
*  So I think the immediate part is something that is so good, like not 10 percent better than what you have now, but like 10x better than what you have now that the adoption becomes natural or so easy to adopt that even 10 percent better could work.
*  And so when you think about what could be 10x better, it has to be something where maybe it's making decisions or it's helping doctors as a co-pilot and something that it's like a superpower they didn't have.
*  Or if it's 10 percent better, but easier to adopt, maybe it doesn't even look like software.
*  You know, maybe it looks like staffing or maybe it looks like, you know, you're texting something and that's easy to incorporate.
*  And even if that does a little bit, that could still be important because health care works at such great scales.
*  Right. Yeah. And I think that's it's timely in the sense that obviously when one of the number one crises that our health care industry is facing right now is a labor crisis.
*  And that we have both both have a shortage of labor to do these kind of highly specialized jobs that we have, whether it be clinical or whether it be administrative.
*  But also those individuals who are in those jobs today are extremely burnt out because of ironically the technology burden that we put on them, whether it be in the form of, you know, revenue cycle tasks or E.H.R.
*  workflows and things like that. So that's really something that we hear all the time.
*  I think the other thing that you touched upon is, you know, it's sort of the damn humans that have gotten in the way in the past, not the technology per se.
*  But one of the hardest things in health care is behavior change and whether that be on the part of the patient to adopt some sort of new behavior that helps them get better.
*  Or in the case of a clinician, you know, something that sort of changes the way that they do their job.
*  And I think that's, you know, to me, one of the biggest opportunities is how do you take things that constitute behavior change that have been proven in very niche populations and productize them, package them in a way that can all of a sudden be sort of globally applied to the broader population that should benefit from it.
*  And so, I mean, we have a number of examples in our portfolio that I think we'll touch on along those lines, but those are very good and big points to to think about right now.
*  So given what you just described, and let's assume that we all fundamentally believe in this optimistic view of what AI can do.
*  What are the use cases for which AI can actually be have utility, you know, in the near term?
*  And we put forth a sort of a two by two, like good consultants.
*  That's what we're supposed to do.
*  Yeah, exactly. And we said, OK, on the one axis, you have sort of B2B use cases.
*  So historically, a lot of technology first gets adopted by the people on the inside.
*  But then on the other side of the axis, you have consumers or patients.
*  And then the other axis is things that are administrative in nature.
*  So maybe more back office versus clinical in nature, where you're actually delivering a clinical service to an end patient.
*  And, you know, you think about and you've talked about this, you know, sort of the stakes are very different in each of those quadrants.
*  And so I think the area that has had the lowest hanging fruit so far has been really the administrative B2B side of that equation.
*  So how do you think about sort of the health care administration internal facing set of use cases?
*  And let's talk about like what we've seen out there that we think has worked.
*  Well, that one seems like a no brainer, right?
*  Because like I think what everyone's worried about is like being a doctor is really hard.
*  And if you're having an AI do clinical recommendations or something like that, we haven't even figured out where the human goes in the loop and all these things.
*  And we will figure it out. And that's work to do.
*  If we're thinking about today, think about the back office is that we've got computers there already.
*  We've got algorithms already. We also have tons of people.
*  And you can ask yourself, like, why do you have people doing RCM or other tasks? Are these tasks that actually could be automatable?
*  And that actually could really make huge impact on sort of the cost.
*  But also, actually, it also maybe changes how we think about this as we think of the back office as a data problem instead of a staffing problem.
*  Yeah, that's actually really interesting. You said algorithm.
*  And what that makes me think of is the claim.
*  So if you think about like the way that payments flow in health care, you know, 90 percent of payments in health care are reimbursed revenue where the provider has to submit literally a claim to the payer that is effectively an algorithm.
*  In many ways, you could think of like the claim is a unit of a piece of logic that needs to be interpreted.
*  Yeah, I don't know if anyone's ever told me that that's actually kind of interesting.
*  Yeah. But then right now, the way that it's processed is like a very serialized workflow where, you know, first you have to interpret.
*  OK, what kind of claim is this? Is it a professional claim? Is it an inpatient or outpatient claim?
*  And then, you know, which payer product is it? There's like thousands of payer products in any given market.
*  So which one do we bump that up against? And then within that plan product, you have a whole bunch of rules about, you know, under what circumstances should this kind of claim be a valid one, et cetera.
*  So anyways, you have this whole value chain of decision making.
*  Oftentimes you have to bring a nurse into that because there might be some clinical judgment.
*  That's where like prior authorization comes into play.
*  So you can almost imagine a world in which like what if we were able to eliminate the claim and basically say because we have all this data, as you alluded to, as well as the sort of automation of the set of decisions that need to be made around that atom of data that you could actually just eliminate that entire end to end process and just have real time payments.
*  So that to me is basically you could eliminate 30 percent of the waste in our system.
*  If you were able to do that, it's a holy grail problem.
*  What's holding that back?
*  I mean, one, it's just so entrenched to you.
*  And, you know, some of there are companies that are out there that are doing this, but you do have to digitize it.
*  You know, like a lot of this is sitting in PDF documents and, you know, which ironically PDFs are not digitized in some sense.
*  Yeah, you mean structure data.
*  And yeah, we have like a company called Turquoise that is basically doing this for contracts.
*  And I mean, the average payer provider contract, which, by the way, could represent like hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for any, you know, given pairing of entities is typically like a, you know, 200 page PDF document that is completely monolithic.
*  But any one line in that contract might have huge implications for both the revenue to that provider as well as the cost structure for that payer.
*  And yet those things don't get litigated, you know, but for every two years when they come up for renegotiation.
*  But no one's looking at that one line. They're looking at the whole kind of aggregate thing.
*  So, you know, what if you were to digitize structured data within that contract and, you know, be able to run scenarios on it and say like, what if the price for these 10 services was this versus that?
*  What would that, you know, implication be on the payment flow through that?
*  And you can maybe even redo these things faster than every two years, too.
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
*  So the other really interesting thing about this concept of, you know, newly digitized streams of information and more longitudinal information about patients is what if we could have an always on clinical trial infrastructure in our country such that, you know, on demand, you can slice and dice the population for exactly the characteristics of humans you want and, you know, produce a data analysis either retrospectively or prospectively.
*  You know, what do you think of that idea? And like, what are the barriers for us to achieve something like that?
*  Yeah, the funny thing about that idea is, I mean, it's a very exciting idea because we could gain so much knowledge and we can improve health care so much. But like, it's a ridiculous thing to imagine doing like without something like AI.
*  Without AI, I don't even know how you do that, how you could pay for that.
*  What do you mean by that? Like what parts of that do you mean?
*  So really, in many ways, this becomes a data problem in terms of slicing and dicing and then keeping track of like this person got this drug and at this moment got had this response and sort of understanding the causal nature.
*  So what we love about clinical trials, I'm going to get a little wonky, is that like, we have to have some sense of causality. Like, I took this drug, this happened. And, you know, people say correlation doesn't mean causation, but that doesn't mean we can't do causation.
*  That's what trials are about. Trials are all about causation. So we have to understand the causal pathway. But with all this data, AI is great, especially certain types of AI like Bayesian statistics are really good at causality.
*  And so we could actually have causal understanding and it can even be complicated. Like, you know, you're not supposed to take like grapefruit juice with your birth control pill because the P450s will nullify this.
*  Like, I don't know how someone figured that out, but who knows what else is out there, you know, that we just didn't find yet.
*  And if you could have an app that like knows your diet and knows the basic things and knows your drugs and has that information, that's kind of mind blowing.
*  That how much we can just have no new drugs, you know, no new treatments and just optimize. We're such an unoptimized nature because that optimization is almost impossible without AI.
*  But then on top of that, once you've built out this infrastructure, now new drugs go into that infrastructure and can optimize.
*  And finally, we don't just optimize for health, but we can optimize, jointly optimize for health and decreasing cost.
*  Like this drug is like 10x better, 10x more expensive than the other drug. But maybe the outcome for me is going to be no different.
*  So maybe I should get the other one. Exactly.
*  And how to think about that, that's such a complex data problem and logistics problem, which is also another part of AI that I think we could actually really finally tackle.
*  So as you can tell, very excited. Yeah, I remember I had a conversation with like the CIO of the VA many years ago where, you know, one of the ways he looked at his population,
*  he's like, Julie, like a million clinical trials are just organically running in my population every day.
*  And I have no idea how to harness it. You know? And so, I mean, even with just EHR data alone, you can imagine the possibilities, let alone if you were also to layer on top of that, just your daily behavioral data and all that kind of stuff.
*  And that's where the LLMs could come in is just a conversational way to capture the day to day journal of what you're doing, what you're eating, who you're interacting with, all that.
*  And it's doctor behavior. It's like the whole system we can finally debug. And the funny thing, coming from a tech background, like, you know, if RCT seems unfamiliar, this is basically a giant A-B test.
*  Exactly. You know? And so this is deeply, deeply entrenched in tech, like even every pixel is A-B tested. I wish healthcare could be optimized the way pixels are in web pages.
*  And you'd have like an A-B-C-D button on in terms of the multivariate.
*  That degree of optimization is something that would be just fantastic.
*  And that gets to the notion, the other sort of holy grail problem that you hear people talk about is could you actually ever have almost a spot market for pricing in healthcare?
*  And on any given day, at any given hour of the day, you might have a very different dynamic of supply that's available for a given service.
*  Why could you not price differently for it the same way we do in other industries?
*  Yeah, so why can't that happen? What's...
*  I mean, today it's probably deemed illegal, honestly, by many of the contracts because you're sort of bound by these, again, these monolithic agreements that highly specify.
*  And the fact that you have this claim system, there's no really no notion of a real time adjudication of the actual price that needs to be paid for that service.
*  And so these are all opportunities to, and maybe it doesn't, this doesn't require the fanciest type of AI per se, but certainly the notion of, you know, being able to run machine learning on these things and say,
*  you know, how many of these rules are just useless because they don't actually move the needle on cost or price.
*  And but which are the ones that are most consequential that we actually should keep and therefore have some kind of automated and systematic way to adjudicate them.
*  So huge opportunity. And that, again, represents a very significant portion of what gets wasted in our system today.
*  So that's a fun one to think about. And then relatedly, I mean, I mentioned, at least in my career in healthcare,
*  like one of the sort of general themes of the problems that I'd like to go after are where there is like a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand.
*  And, you know, I think a lot of the companies in our portfolio represent that problem space.
*  And I had built a company that was in the scheduling space, which, you know, when you think about the phenomenon by which I'm sure you've experienced this, you know, you as a patient are told to wait weeks for a doctor's appointment.
*  And you assume that that's because every doctor is booked out solid.
*  But it actually turns out that a lot of the capacity in our system goes completely wasted.
*  And, you know, if you could just simply get better visibility into the underlying data streams, then potentially you could really mitigate the wait times and the experience for the consumer, while also helping the providers kind of best use their time.
*  Are there any examples that you've seen that you think are an interesting representation of that?
*  I know we have a lot of companies that are trying to both create increased transparency of supply, like, you know, companies that are using coaching or provider groups and and then bringing that to bear and care models.
*  Well, here I think you're describing something which is even like maybe before even get to AI, which is like we got to get like off the whiteboards and, you know, onto some more complex, more modern sort of computer approaches.
*  Yeah, systems of record systems of record and and that actually, you know, we often talk about like technology versus people.
*  You know, where's the weak spot? Where's the problem? Maybe the most radical thing one could say is that maybe the way of doing medicine has to change.
*  You know, yeah. Well, and so, for instance, like just the workflow of a doctor, it's very important.
*  Like you think you're if how a doctor goes through their day, how can we support the doctor to do what we all want them to do and what they want to do, which is maximize patient welfare.
*  But and maybe view it as something that takes it off of them. Maybe it takes, for instance, a provider to say, hey, look, I'm going to come up with this and do this in a new way.
*  And you think about there are providers that are thinking about things like that. Maybe it would be something like that where you have to start more from a clean sheet of paper and to reform how it works.
*  I think about like devoted and, you know, there's infrastructure or an or like they address the system internally.
*  And to the extent they're not they're not optimized, that's something that even they know and they can see.
*  Right. And that's an example in the case of companies like devoted who actually did start with clean sheet.
*  Yeah. Right. And built their own sort of scheduling system to accommodate the exact care model that they were going after.
*  Yeah. I remember from some of the work that we did at my old company, you would see the way that doctors designed their schedule.
*  And very much to your point, they would design the templates of their schedules specifically in a very protective, like almost a defensive way, because they felt wronged by the way that the system sent patients to.
*  I mean, it's a learned behavior because they've gotten their time. Yeah. And they've gotten screwed in the past.
*  You know, let's say that we have 10 pitches with new entrepreneurs that we've never met in a row in a given day.
*  And you're just on, you know, for like hours straight. And you know how like physically and mentally exhausting that is.
*  It's the same thing for doctors when they say if you give me, you know, four new patients back to back in the morning, that is far more sort of taxing to me than if you intersperse repeat patients or, you know, other tasks and what not.
*  And after seeing the pitches, then we have to go on Epic and write about them. Exactly. And that's even worse, my God, if we had to do that.
*  But so so you could see how the unfortunate side effect of the way that the systems had traditionally have been designed has now caused this sort of ripple effect and defensive behavior.
*  But if you were to just kind of start from a clean sheet as companies like Devoted are able to do, could you actually design a much more logical system that actually learns from historical data?
*  Right. And there could be almost like a reinforcement learning component to that where the doctors could provide feedback and you can learn over time.
*  So we talked about one idea, which is clean sheet of paper. Yeah. Is that the only way?
*  Well, I think I mean, what I'm hoping also happens as part of this wave of A.I. is that it's really a forcing function for people to actually take advantage of the data that we have now digitized.
*  Right. So we're actually only what, 10, 11 years post meaningful use in health care, which was the act that incentivized doctors to actually adopt electronic health records to begin with.
*  And it's kind of remarkable to think that, like, even five years ago, like less than 70 percent of doctors had an electronic health record.
*  So we're actually relatively new into the era of even having digitized forms of information about patients over a longitudinal period of time.
*  And so in many ways, we haven't at all scratched the surface of exploiting those data sets.
*  And there really haven't been that much incentive to historically, I would argue.
*  And certainly not necessarily the technology capabilities on kind of the middleware layer of the stack to to be able to do anything meaningful and useful with that data.
*  But I think that's where the advent of the tremendous technology shifts that we've seen on the A.I. side and what you can do with that information, how you can synthesize it, how you can present it to someone in a way that's actually usable and fresh.
*  That could be the tipping point that actually gets people to unleash the data.
*  We're also, by the way, in a period of time when, you know, provider organizations, hospitals are struggling financially.
*  And so many of them are looking at, OK, how can I actually monetize my data assets?
*  Right. Like what do all of our companies want?
*  They want to eat data. And, you know, one of the ways by which they can do that is actually partnering with these provider organizations who have these systems of record that they haven't been able to exploit and actually pay them and give them, you know, ref share or equity or whatever it is to get access to data.
*  It's interesting to ask like of the various crises like the staffing crisis versus the issue hospitals are dealing with, like which crises are going to be catalysts and which will be impediments.
*  I think we kind of feel like the staffing crisis really is like tailwinds for A.I.
*  Strangely, yes.
*  Yes.
*  And COVID, I think, is tailwind for A.I.
*  Because we're so used to virtual.
*  Yes.
*  But like maybe not all these crises will be helpful.
*  I think that would be particularly interesting to see how that's out.
*  Yeah, I think that's a great point.
*  I think certainly there are many who would view it not as a tailwind, but I think it's a good forcing function because now people are at a breaking point where the status quo way of solving that problem, which again is how do we produce more doctors?
*  How do we produce more nurses?
*  We just we can't do that physically.
*  And so that is, you know, driving, I think, a lot of this adoption.
*  We were remarking as a team that at this last JP Morgan conference, like 100 percent of the incumbent payers and providers got up on stage and talked about not just what they want to do with A.I., but how they're actually deploying A.I. in practice because they found no other way to be able to solve those kind of more fundamental problems.
*  I think the other sort of tailwind that some might call an impediment, certainly builders in our universe, call a tailwind is the business model change in health care.
*  Right.
*  So movement towards value based care fundamentally breaks the kind of the schema of like how health care has worked for decades.
*  And I think incumbents are more likely to be on their heels with that sort of that dynamic versus the upstart to themselves.
*  And I think that's a great point.
*  And I think the other sort of tailwind that some might call an impediment is the business model change in health care.
*  Right.
*  So movement towards value based care fundamentally breaks the kind of the schema of like how health care has worked for decades.
*  And I think incumbents are more likely to be on their heels with that sort of that dynamic versus the upstart to themselves can build their entire, you know, sort of care model and operating model on the basis of those new payment domains versus having to I actually don't envy organizations who have to have one foot in each world.
*  Right.
*  Because having half of your shop in a fee for service model and then the other half in a value based model is very, very challenging to do.
*  Well, it's fun to think that like in a fee for service world, AI is nice, but maybe actually doesn't goes against what you want.
*  And in a value based care world, actually, AI is the catalyst.
*  Right.
*  Because if you can do things better, you can see the value to it.
*  Yeah, it's actually funny that the example that that reminds me of is how the AI are getting so much better at the end of the day.
*  So what's the payers?
*  So there's a bunch of major national payers who are using AI algorithms to automate prior authorization.
*  And so all they're doing is taking the rules that humans wrote that humans were executing slowly and doing it faster.
*  And so now all of a sudden, everyone is complaining.
*  Oh, everything like the denial rate is going up.
*  But it's actually not it's not the the rate of denial rate is going up.
*  It's actually not the rate of denial rate is going up.
*  It's the speed with which the denials are happening.
*  That's going up.
*  Don't blame the technology blame the humans who actually wrote the rules, and you're just seeing kind of an exacerbated version of it.
*  And I think we're going to deal with a lot of that of kind of the finger pointing at the technology where it's actually just implementing the broken system underneath it.
*  And that's why this kind of move to like new business models gives you the opportunity to kind of, you know,
*  clean that up and start with logical, logical, well, even more logical.
*  like new business models give you the opportunity
*  to kind of clean that up and start with logical ways
*  to control spend.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  OK, so we talked about health care administration.
*  We talked about scheduling opportunities.
*  Let's actually talk about the EHR itself.
*  So LLM as an EHR, what do you think about that?
*  Yeah, well, so I think the thing that's really underpreciated
*  out of the LLM is people think of it as like this Oracle
*  or something like that.
*  But I think it's maybe, at least for us,
*  I think of it as a UI.
*  Right.
*  And it's kind of funny because we start with command line
*  interfaces for those who have ever dealt with that.
*  And then we have GUIs because that's better than command line.
*  But now we're back to text and typing things in,
*  except instead of some weird command
*  that you have to memorize, you just like,
*  just tell me what you want.
*  Right, you just speak English.
*  Yeah, just speak English.
*  And we're so optimized for speaking English to each other.
*  I mean, that's easy.
*  It doesn't require training in the same ways.
*  And so I think as a UI now, that makes sense.
*  And now when you're seeing as an EHR as an LLM,
*  then I guess you're kind of meaning that the data is
*  in there and it can be queried like this
*  and maybe synthesized.
*  That's all very natural.
*  I think obviously you want to be very clear about partitioning
*  things.
*  And so maybe you're doing it with like RAG
*  or something like that, whereas getting information coming
*  back.
*  But maybe the question to turn around
*  is like, again, the technology sounds very plausible.
*  You can imagine a hackathon that would put some pieces together
*  and get that done.
*  But I think you need more than just like connecting to GPT-4
*  or Gemini or something like that.
*  You need something medically specific.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  This is where I think one of the prime examples where we certainly
*  believe that a specialist model is necessary to understand
*  the specific nuances of how to interpret medical information
*  versus general internet information.
*  And I mean, that's certainly a big area of development
*  for builders as we see it.
*  Companies that are building tools that can do everything
*  from summarize existing medical record data.
*  How do you tell the story of Vijay Pandey
*  before he walks in the door so that you understand
*  like his journey and not just look
*  at a bunch of numerical records and sort
*  of sporadic information about different visits and whatnot,
*  but really truly the story of him,
*  including things like your social determinants
*  and what happens in the home and outside of the clinical setting.
*  So we see a lot of companies kind of building that.
*  The other obvious use case is the scribing use case
*  where have a conversation with your doctor,
*  actually look them in the eye rather than them
*  sitting at a keyboard during your entire visit.
*  That also gets written as a story.
*  It's a story that then gets added to your medical record
*  and it can create that flywheel effect
*  of continuing to add to the narrative of your journey.
*  One way to sort of think about AI in healthcare
*  is take the existing jobs and then see which ones can go in.
*  And that makes a lot of sense.
*  Also curious if you slice and dice to a different way,
*  because we don't have people with AI,
*  how would we do differently?
*  Because like people are assigned specific jobs
*  because of the way humans work.
*  But like maybe if when we're finally said and done,
*  when AI can do everything,
*  maybe the resident isn't the role that it would take.
*  Yeah.
*  If you were to say like unbundle the job of the doctor,
*  what components could you re-bundle into a different thing?
*  Yeah, there was actually a time where this concept
*  of like a dataist was sort of popularized
*  where like a baseline component of basically
*  what every job in healthcare is doing
*  is some degree of data interpretation.
*  And so if you were to unbundle that component
*  and create almost like a horizontal job
*  that was just doing data interpretation
*  and this kind of thing.
*  And maybe that's actually the better analog
*  to what I described earlier.
*  It's like, what if there was a dataist role
*  that effectively is an LLM
*  that is synthesizing all this information?
*  I think the thing that's missing right now
*  to sort of make this a reality is
*  today's information architecture is very sporadic, right?
*  You're a pretty healthy person.
*  You probably see your doctor maybe like,
*  once or twice a year.
*  And so how do you augment that
*  with more continuous information?
*  Whether it be self-reported,
*  whether it be remote patient monitoring data,
*  whether it be just other information sources
*  to create that more holistic picture.
*  But I like that notion of flipping the jobs on their head
*  and kind of thinking about the components a different way.
*  Well, and the fun thing about the dataist is like,
*  I think the UI is pretty important, right?
*  Because we're talking about a team of people.
*  And then medicine often is done by a team.
*  There might be a nurse or a PA or a doctor
*  or a specialist and all these people.
*  And where the AI comes in, one idea is a copilot,
*  which is like each one of the team members has a copilot.
*  But what's interesting about the dataist
*  is like the AI is a peer, a contributor, or the team.
*  And it has its role that actually
*  everyone feels pretty good about.
*  And you think about it,
*  you don't put a person to do the dataist job.
*  I mean, in principle with a calculator and a lot of time,
*  they maybe could do all what's necessary,
*  but you never have a human being do that.
*  And that might be a very easy first entry
*  where it's like they're doing what they're good at.
*  Yeah, that actually reminds me of a company that we saw
*  that it sort of reminded me of like,
*  what if every nurse in the inpatient ward,
*  because the inpatient setting is very chaotic,
*  very active, surprises happen all the time.
*  And a lot of nursing teams have sort of either live
*  like walkie talkie type devices just on their shoulder,
*  or they'll have some sort of, again,
*  real time communication mechanism
*  with the rest of their care team.
*  And this company was saying,
*  why not put an LLM into the same walkie talkie signal,
*  and actually literally just have it be like
*  almost a Jiminy Cricket sitting on everyone's shoulder
*  being like, hey, I'm sensing X pattern
*  by virtue of listening into your conversations.
*  Let's all remember that this is happening
*  with this patient over here,
*  and I think there could be a safety issue over there.
*  So you can imagine, yeah, I like that notion of kind of,
*  it's almost like the way that I talk about Baymax
*  all the time.
*  So like, could everyone just have kind of a Baymax companion
*  hang out in their care team,
*  and be sort of the steward of all the information flow,
*  synthesize it, and read it back when they find something
*  that probably warrants sort of an alert with that group.
*  I don't know if you spent much time in the ED,
*  I like break this and cut that.
*  And I have a lot of scars and stitches and so on.
*  And I'm like, so I remember it was a few years ago,
*  I actually ran around here,
*  I cut myself with a chef's knife.
*  I was probably showing off to the kids.
*  Oh, geez.
*  And so it wasn't looking good,
*  I was like, oh, I should get stitches.
*  And I go to the ED, and I'm there for like two hours.
*  And I look around, yeah, just waiting,
*  and I look around and I'm like,
*  this could be another four hours.
*  And I'm doing my math.
*  And maybe for the first hour I'm bugging the nurse
*  and the inbound, but after all, I just leave.
*  And there's various situations
*  where I just wanna talk to somebody,
*  but you can't have everybody talk to somebody
*  because they're gonna be overloaded.
*  If I could just be texting somebody,
*  and I just wanna know where things are,
*  and if it's busy, that's fine.
*  Or maybe I don't even need to be there.
*  But that triaging too could be huge.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah, and this gets to, okay,
*  so going back to the concept of
*  unbundling the role of a clinician,
*  there's one part which is actually the treatment part.
*  So that's the part where maybe we can't necessarily today
*  build an LLM that will stitch your finger,
*  but the notion of triage, right?
*  And kind of getting you to the right sites of care.
*  So should I stay home?
*  Should I go to an urgent care clinic?
*  Should I go immediately to the ED?
*  Or am I okay just going to my PCP?
*  That is actually a critical role.
*  We wrote a piece about this where we said,
*  my version of that today is I call my doctor cousin,
*  as all of my family members do.
*  The poor lady, she's a cardiologist,
*  but she gets every single call
*  about every single specialty under the sun,
*  and she'll tell me literally,
*  like should you take your son to the urgent care,
*  or does this need to go immediately to the ED?
*  And so that is one of the roles
*  that sort of LLM construct could play,
*  which actually would also do a huge service to doctors
*  that they don't have to be the ones
*  who are fielding those questions.
*  Well, especially the alternative is Dr. Google, right?
*  Or WebMD or whatever.
*  And then the patient, the amateur is deciding.
*  And especially with my friends,
*  you've probably been through this,
*  like your kid is sick, and you're like,
*  I probably don't need to go in, but it's my kid.
*  So if it's like even 5%, maybe I'll go.
*  And that's just a drain on everybody,
*  doctors and patients at the same time.
*  So we talked about EHRs and kind of this notion
*  of the patient story.
*  We're now getting into this notion of,
*  okay, if you were to take almost like
*  the front door experience to healthcare,
*  and what are the big opportunities for AI
*  to make an impact there?
*  One is simply like, instead of going to Google,
*  going to a specialized tool or whatever it might be
*  that's trained in this way.
*  One of the questions that always comes up is,
*  to what degree, what are the regulatory rails on this?
*  So at what point do you cross the line
*  into actually clinical decision making,
*  and how should I think about this as a builder?
*  I know you've obviously done a ton of thinking on this,
*  and a ton of work, including talking to the regulators
*  and understanding what they think.
*  What kind of advice would you give to entrepreneurs
*  who are trying to figure out where that line is
*  and whether or not they should cross it?
*  So a couple of things, I think some of the lines
*  are more clear than others.
*  But in the cases where there is any gray zone,
*  I think the regulators are eager to chat with startups.
*  And especially maybe it's on the software side,
*  that might be ONC, but to try to figure out where you are,
*  and we've seen a lot of successful founders
*  who've done that type of collaboration.
*  And I think generally that's a pretty strong approach,
*  because then there's no surprises on either side.
*  The tricky part is when nobody knows.
*  And so I think it's not just about consultation,
*  but it's also leading.
*  And so taking the framework and the philosophy
*  for how we regulate things right now,
*  and really understanding is this software as a device?
*  Is that the right framework?
*  And really being a leader in terms of how we should
*  be thinking about this.
*  And I think there's actually welcoming of that as well,
*  because it's new for everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think that we are actually
*  an industry that has a regulatory framework when
*  it comes to AI specifically?
*  And so in many of these are some of the rare cases
*  where health care is actually ahead of the curve,
*  as far as technology goes.
*  What's your sense of, does generative AI specifically,
*  do LLMs constitute enough of a sea change relative
*  to historical waves of AI that it
*  should warrant an entirely different regulatory framework?
*  Or do we think we should try to make the current system work
*  for those new technologies?
*  Our space already has a ton of regulation.
*  And so in that case, you have to now ask,
*  what's the specific use case where more regulation
*  is helpful for patients?
*  And what's the example of that?
*  I don't see people talking about that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the broader point of don't necessarily
*  focus on regulating the technology,
*  but rather the thing for which the technology will be used.
*  Yeah, the use.
*  Yeah.
*  OK, well, let's go to the holy grail of all holy grails,
*  which is AI doctor.
*  So how far off in the horizon do you think that concept is,
*  where you could fully embody the full stack role of a clinician
*  making diagnostic decisions and treatment decisions
*  and whatnot?
*  And what needs to be true, do you think,
*  in just the broader ecosystem for that to be the case?
*  Yeah, so I think one of the two by twos I like
*  is trying to understand which decisions are complex
*  and which are simple, and then which answers are robust
*  to mistakes and which are not robust to mistakes.
*  And so things that are simple and actually robust to mistakes,
*  those can already be done by machine learning and so on.
*  Things that are simple but actually
*  have major consequences with mistakes,
*  like driving a car.
*  Like everyone can drive a car, but if you do it wrong,
*  you could kill people.
*  So that one's actually tricky, but you
*  see people working on that with self-driving cars,
*  and there's a lot of work.
*  I think where medicine is hard is that it's
*  something that's complex, it needs a specialist,
*  and it's resistant.
*  It's complex, and mistakes can have huge impacts.
*  And so maybe what we could do is we should work our way up there.
*  And it's not even a question of like, should we?
*  But we kind of have to if we think about some of these crises
*  that are coming.
*  And so maybe you start with nursing,
*  and we've seen this with Hippocratic,
*  and that makes sense.
*  You're not doing diagnosing, you're doing no harm.
*  Literally, yeah.
*  And so that's, I think, very clever.
*  Then maybe you could work your way into PA,
*  physician assistant.
*  Maybe you could work your way from there into GP.
*  And I think the general practitioner,
*  sort of concierge doctor, that tier
*  is kind of a really interesting tier,
*  because largely you're triaging and sending off
*  to specialists.
*  So the AI doesn't have to be an oncologist,
*  an cardiologist, and all these things.
*  And so that tier actually alone is kind of really interesting
*  since so much of medicine is done at that tier.
*  And so much of issues of access are access to that tier too.
*  And so if everybody had the AI concierge doctor
*  in their pocket, I think that would actually be dramatic
*  in terms of the impact on health.
*  So even when we just get to that tier,
*  I'd be pretty excited.
*  And once we're at that tier,
*  then you can imagine sort of going to specialist world.
*  But that might be, that later part might be a bit off.
*  Yeah, and I mean, to your point,
*  it's an inevitability that we'll have to figure out
*  a way to create leverage on the supply side
*  of this portion of our labor base.
*  What are your thoughts on co-pilots for doctors,
*  and is that a more near-term tractable version of this
*  that you think could have an impact in the near term?
*  I think so the whole problem with co-pilots is,
*  can you work it in a way that goes in the doctor workflow
*  where they view it as a benefit, not a nuisance?
*  Yeah.
*  It's not some alert or whatever.
*  It's like something where they are going to it.
*  If you can do that, and maybe we've seen this
*  with scribes and so on, something where doctors like,
*  hell yeah, I want this, this is great.
*  If we can create that, and maybe that's the sort of
*  the challenge and the call to arms for founders,
*  create something, some product that people
*  are clamoring for it, and that's obviously knowing
*  that space really well, and knowing your customers,
*  and knowing people are going to use it.
*  I think if you can get into the workflow,
*  then I think it could go really well.
*  Bayesian did kind of the ultimate,
*  which is let's just embed it into the HR workflows
*  so that inevitably it's just there when they open it up,
*  and there's not really any need
*  for individual physician buy-in.
*  Yeah, yeah, totally.
*  Given what we just talked about
*  and all these grand challenges,
*  what are some of the types of startups that we wish
*  that would walk through the door
*  that we just haven't seen yet?
*  Yeah, so one area that I've been waiting for,
*  and I think it's maybe a little early,
*  maybe not, maybe just right at the right time,
*  is something where clinical trials
*  can be addressed with AI.
*  And this is where it's a confluence of a couple things.
*  One is like clinical trials are obviously so important.
*  We talked about real world and like the ongoing
*  clinical trials as a part of healthcare.
*  But then finally, clinical trials,
*  because so much money flows through it,
*  you could improve them 5% or 10%.
*  It's not like you have to do something heroic
*  to be able to, you don't have to 10 exit or 100 exit.
*  I remember like a decade or so ago,
*  I have an acquaintance who was working for Google
*  and they were optimizing various filters and this and that,
*  and they made it like 5X better, one of the ad filters.
*  And basically 5X was like $100 million.
*  5% was $100 million, yeah.
*  And so I may be really jealous.
*  Like I'm working on something in drug design or whatever
*  to make big leaps and bounds
*  and small things for big cash flows can have a huge impact.
*  So something for clinical trials could be huge
*  or even just picking like the order of rank ordering
*  of clinical trials to sort of do better job there.
*  Anything in that space, I think would have a huge impact
*  and we haven't seen very much.
*  And part of it is like, it's maybe not where
*  if you're outside of that space, you may not think to go.
*  But I think that would be my pick.
*  What's your pick?
*  Mine would be, I mean, kind of comparable in the sense
*  of the nature of the opportunity,
*  which is if you were to design an AI native health plan
*  from scratch and basically be the way by which,
*  healthcare payments flow,
*  like all the problems that we talked about earlier,
*  what are the components of a health plan?
*  It's a payments mechanism and claims.
*  It is a underwriting chassis in terms of how you score risk
*  within a population.
*  And then it's a network of who are the providers
*  that you would actually steer patients to
*  on the basis of understanding
*  what kinds of services they need.
*  And the way that those are built today,
*  you see huge opportunities to both leverage data and AI
*  in the sense of exactly what you just talked about
*  where a 1% impact on the cost structure of a health plan
*  or the way that you underwrite risk in a certain health plan
*  could literally mean hundreds of millions of dollars
*  of either cost savings or better economics
*  to the providers who are part of those networks.
*  So that to me, kind of this notion of a full stack AI
*  native health plan that takes full risk on populations
*  and exploits all of these data sets
*  that we're talking about to really understand
*  almost at an individual level.
*  You can almost sort of imagine like an individualized
*  health plan that is like purposeful for you
*  on the basis of your behaviors and your medical history
*  and things like that, that is priced entirely different
*  than all of your employee peers
*  who are in the same group plan versus what it is today
*  where it's so least common denominator
*  and like sort of everyone loses
*  because you're trying to design for everyone
*  in the same sort of brute force fashion.
*  So that would be fine.
*  Well, those are some very big audacious grand challenges
*  that we hope many builders go off and pursue
*  and we'd obviously love to talk to anyone
*  who's working on problems of this ilk.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
