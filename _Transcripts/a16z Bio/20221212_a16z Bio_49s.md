# Selling to SMBs â€” Stakeholders and Selling to Enterprise
**a16z Bio:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA)
*  So we are actively building out an enterprise sales team [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA&t=0.0s)]
*  because the process of selling to a large enterprise [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA&t=4.64s)]
*  is just very different than it is selling into a company [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA&t=7.44s)]
*  where your budget holder is your primary contact, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA&t=11.76s)]
*  is your integration lead and everything in between. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA&t=15.24s)]
*  Whereas at a large health plan, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA&t=18.8s)]
*  each one of those stages of the sales cycle [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA&t=20.72s)]
*  might have three or four different stakeholders [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  and a different champion. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA&t=25.2s)]
*  And so we've just had to change our sales approach. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA&t=26.92s)]
