# Selling to SMBs â€” Stakeholders and Selling to Enterprise
**a16z Bio:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTM7z-SxgA)
*  So we are actively building out an enterprise sales team
*  because the process of selling to a large enterprise
*  is just very different than it is selling into a company
*  where your budget holder is your primary contact,
*  is your integration lead and everything in between.
*  Whereas at a large health plan,
*  each one of those stages of the sales cycle
*  might have three or four different stakeholders
*  and a different champion.
*  And so we've just had to change our sales approach.
