Video Description: COVID has strained our healthcare system, payors are feeling the squeeze of rising costs, and patients are bearing the brunt of the current system's shortcomings. As a result, healthcare is undergoing a transformation, from care that is predominately fee for service and based on volume of care to value-based care. 
Risk-based contracts are critical to building businesses based on risk and value, rather than fees and volume. We talked to digital health builders — from Firefly Health, Pearl Health, Waymark, Carrum Health, Eleanor Health, Patina Health, and BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina — at the forefront of the shift to value-based care about how to build risk-based companies.

# Risk-based Contracting for Value-based Care, a Founder's Playbook
**a16z Bio:** [April 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g)
*  Hi, I'm Julie. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=0.0s)]
*  And I'm Justin. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=21.68s)]
*  And welcome to the second piece in our series on new go-to-market motions in digital health. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=23.12s)]
*  For our first video, we looked at the B2C2B go-to-market approach. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=28.88s)]
*  And in this video, we're going to dive into how digital health companies are driving towards [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=33.16s)]
*  value-based care using risk-based contracting. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=37.16s)]
*  But to understand risk-based contracting, let's first unpack what is value-based care. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=41.28s)]
*  So value-based care, or VBC, is both a clinical approach that focuses on preventative services [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=45.84s)]
*  and long-term health care outcomes, but it's also a payment model that enables the appropriate [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=52.92s)]
*  incentive alignment to achieve those clinical goals. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=58.16s)]
*  And it's oftentimes thought about as kind of the antithesis to the traditional fee-for-service [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=61.72s)]
*  payment system in which providers are really paid for individual units of care using established [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=66.24s)]
*  billing codes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=72.44s)]
*  These payer-provider contracts have really driven these fee-for-service rates through [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=73.44s)]
*  the roof. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=77.12s)]
*  And that's been a major driver of why our nation's health care costs have skyrocketed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=78.12s)]
*  of GDP without a commensurate rise in clinical outcomes and inpatient experience. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=84.22s)]
*  And so this push towards value-based care is really a push to align value creation with [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=90.7s)]
*  value capture. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=95.9s)]
*  And that's really where risk-based contracts come in. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=97.34s)]
*  They are a reimbursement mechanism that aligns incentives rather than providers being paid [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=99.66s)]
*  based on higher volumes and individual procedures and services. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=105.38s)]
*  Measures are rewarded for hitting certain quality and cost outcomes and measures. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=109.22s)]
*  So we often talk about going at risk as if it's a single approach. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=114.26s)]
*  But the reality is that risk-based models represent a broad spectrum. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=117.78s)]
*  And as we move across the spectrum, a number of different factors can change, but it's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=121.62s)]
*  primarily the fundamental unit of payment and the degree of ownership or accountability [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=124.92s)]
*  that a company takes on for a given patient or given patient population. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=129.74s)]
*  And these different factors ultimately manifest in various types of risk-based models. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=134.02s)]
*  The first bucket is pay for performance. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=138.48s)]
*  It's something that rides on traditional fee-for-service rails, but often has some kind of clinical [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=140.76s)]
*  or operational performance guarantee that's layered on top. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  The second bucket here is PMPM, or per member per month. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=148.8s)]
*  This is a model where a company will often charge a set amount for clinical services. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=152.84s)]
*  So they might receive $5 or $50 or $150 per member per month. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=156.12s)]
*  But coupled with that is this risk-sharing component where there's some limited sharing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=160.56s)]
*  of economic upside against the total cost of care. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=164.22s)]
*  And as we continue, the third bucket is bundled payments. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=167.0s)]
*  And this is a structure where companies take on full risk against all of the care for a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=170.68s)]
*  given patient, but for a specific episode of care. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=174.36s)]
*  And that episode is typically defined by a certain time period or types of services. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=178.08s)]
*  That might be something like a bundle for maternity care or a bundle for knee replacement [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=183.48s)]
*  surgery. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=187.32s)]
*  And then we get into capitation models. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=188.76s)]
*  And in a capitated model, a company or a provider takes a flat rate of payment for a patient [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=190.8s)]
*  while taking on full risk against a wider range of services than we saw in bundled arrangements. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=195.52s)]
*  In a subcapitated model, the company is taking on payment and risk for a subset of clinical [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=201.84s)]
*  services. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=206.72s)]
*  For example, they might take on payment and risk for all primary care or all outpatient [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=207.88s)]
*  services. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=212.4s)]
*  But in this example, not necessarily for hospital care or for other acute services or for pharmacy [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=213.68s)]
*  spend. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=218.04s)]
*  And then in the fullest version of an at-risk model, we have global cap or global capitation [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=219.04s)]
*  where a company takes on full risk against the total cost of care. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=223.36s)]
*  Or in other words, for all clinical services for that patient. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=226.72s)]
*  And in models with global cap, companies are effectively becoming the payer as they take [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=230.6s)]
*  on this full actuarial risk for that patient. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=234.16s)]
*  So let's take a step back. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=237.36s)]
*  Where are we at in this macro level shift from fee for service to value based care? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=238.68s)]
*  In 2021, fewer than 40% of healthcare dollars actually flowed through a payment model that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=244.52s)]
*  had any kind of substantial value component to it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=249.16s)]
*  And only 6% of dollars were in subcapitation or in a global capitation arrangement. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=252.12s)]
*  But that being said, we're constantly hearing about risk-based contracts and value-based [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=256.96s)]
*  care. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=260.56s)]
*  They're in the zeitgeist. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=261.56s)]
*  And that really has to do with a number of different things. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=263.12s)]
*  One of those being that over the past couple of years, COVID has hit the health system [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=266.16s)]
*  like a meteor. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=270.0s)]
*  And it's really exposed this general lack of resiliency of a predominantly fee for service [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=271.0s)]
*  system. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=275.76s)]
*  Not just in the incentive and reimbursement models, but also in the ability of fee for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=277.2s)]
*  service models to absorb unpredictability. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=281.36s)]
*  And it showed at the same time that those with higher exposure to value-based contracts [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=284.04s)]
*  are often better positioned than those who are completely dependent on fee for service [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=288.68s)]
*  revenue streams. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=292.04s)]
*  So even more broadly, payers are continuing to feel the squeeze arising medical costs. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=293.42s)]
*  And because of this, are doubling down on risk-based and value-based models. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=297.88s)]
*  For example, just this last year, we heard from CMS, which is the Centers for Medicare [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=302.74s)]
*  and Medicaid Services, that they're aiming to have all of Medicare beneficiaries cared [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=306.6s)]
*  for by providers and value-based care models by 2030. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  But at the same time, many traditional care models and providers aren't ready to take [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=315.92s)]
*  on that risk. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=320.48s)]
*  Excitingly and optimistically, purpose-built virtual care tech stacks have the potential [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  to drive better risk management and more nimble care models. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=326.16s)]
*  And care models that learn over time in ways that just are difficult for traditional providers [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=330.36s)]
*  that are purpose-built for fee for service. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=334.96s)]
*  Even though there are a number of companies that have struggled in risk-based models, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=337.44s)]
*  there have been a number that have also defined the path of how to do this really well. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  We talked to digital health builders who have navigated risk-based contracts and who understand [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=344.68s)]
*  the specific challenges that come with building and scaling a risk-based go-to-market. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=348.56s)]
*  And in this playbook, we highlight their learnings with a focus on key phases of the builder [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=353.08s)]
*  journey. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=356.24s)]
*  First is deciding to go at risk. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=357.24s)]
*  Next, establishing partnerships. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=360.56s)]
*  Next, changing success. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=363.96s)]
*  And then finally, scaling. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  So jumping in, let's hear how some of these founders grappled with the decision of whether [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  a risk-based model was even right for their business. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=370.84s)]
*  In fact, like many of the founders we talked to, Jack Stoddard, who's the CEO of Patina, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=373.8s)]
*  which is a virtual first and home-based primary care model for older adults, accelerated their [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  path to risk because they had to. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=383.2s)]
*  When you're coming to market with the orthogonal view of the world, often it doesn't fit into [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=385.8s)]
*  the existing business model contracts. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=391.28s)]
*  And so specifically in healthcare for primary care, the market is used to paying only four [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=393.23999999999995s)]
*  to maybe six percent for primary care. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=399.4s)]
*  And our belief is if you invest more in primary care, that you can actually take out waste [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=402.11999999999995s)]
*  in the rest of the other 96 percent of healthcare. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=406.88s)]
*  And so because our model is counterintuitive to how the market has always approached it, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  we said, look, let's be accountable for outcomes and let's ultimately build this for risk. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=416.52s)]
*  Risk-based models can provide more freedom to define the care model. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  This freedom can give space to prove out the impact of these novel care models. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=424.32s)]
*  But at the same time, this path to risk has to be balanced with the potential downsides. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=427.68s)]
*  Many of the founders we talked to took a glide path or a phased approach to risk. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=433.56s)]
*  Let's hear from Roger Bhatniji, the CEO at Weymark, where they're building a value-based, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=438.48s)]
*  community-driven care model for Medicaid. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=443.12s)]
*  They took an accelerated path to risk. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=445.14000000000004s)]
*  Roger highlights where a glide path approach may make more sense for a company. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=447.8s)]
*  Risk is opportunity. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  Risk is also freedom. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=453.0s)]
*  It's the freedom to try new things, the freedom to break the bounds of what is kind of status [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=455.0s)]
*  quo or conventionally considered the approach. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=461.12s)]
*  Risk is opportunity, but it's also risk. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=464.8s)]
*  And there's enough risk in building a new company. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=467.1s)]
*  I would not recommend moving toward risk simply for some kind of valuation arbitrage. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=469.56s)]
*  I think you do it because it's needed to prove a new model of care or it's needed to cover [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=475.56s)]
*  something that's just simply not paid for under existing CPT codes. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=483.32s)]
*  We heard something similar from Corbin Petro, the CEO at Eleanor Health, where they're building [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=487.92s)]
*  a hybrid value-based care model for substance use disorder. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=492.8s)]
*  So in our space, what we know and what the evidence tells us is that creating meaning [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=496.24s)]
*  and purpose in people's lives really helps retain them in recovery and support their [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=500.52s)]
*  mental health and wellbeing. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=505.44s)]
*  Well, there's no CPT code for creating meaning and purpose in people's lives. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=506.68s)]
*  And so you have to figure out another way to address that. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=511.74s)]
*  And that's sort of the clinical model and the business model go hand in hand. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=514.56s)]
*  You can't sustainably deliver the clinical model without the business model piece in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=519.16s)]
*  place. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=523.96s)]
*  Taking on risk is a powerful opportunity to create alignment between the business model, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=525.48s)]
*  the care model and the operating model, but it's also inherently risky. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=529.88s)]
*  And so many companies ultimately decide to take a glide path to risk. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  But where on the risk spectrum is the right place to start? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=537.84s)]
*  You probably arrive at the level of risk based on what levers do you need for the model to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=540.92s)]
*  work. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=546.32s)]
*  And so, for example, if you needed to control in your care model, all of utilization management, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=547.32s)]
*  the claims payment and network design, well, there's probably no other way for a payer [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=553.72s)]
*  to let you have those keys other than moving to a true global cap. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=558.2800000000001s)]
*  It's difficult to jump straight to full risk. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=563.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=566.44s)]
*  So most payers are going to look for you to have enough experience, enough patience and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=567.44s)]
*  frankly enough financial weight behind you that you can actually have the ability financially [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=572.96s)]
*  to take and manage risk. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  And so to do that, I would say start slow, try to align your incentives with the payer [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=579.88s)]
*  where they want to help you get to full risk. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=585.76s)]
*  But even if you start on the glide path with fee for service, it can be really hard to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=588.56s)]
*  build for fee for service and for the ultimate goal of value based care in parallel. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=592.52s)]
*  As we'll hear from Fay Rottenberg, who's the CEO at Firefly Help, where they're building [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  a health plan on top of a virtual first value based care model. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=601.2s)]
*  They started with fee for service contracts, but they built for value in the operating [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  and care models from day one. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=608.4s)]
*  So day one, Firefly launched with really basic contracts with payers in Massachusetts. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=610.76s)]
*  And by basic, I mean fee for service. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=616.84s)]
*  And that was never the business we wanted to be in, but it was what we needed to get [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=619.12s)]
*  going. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=624.6s)]
*  And so we had basic fee for service contracts with payers. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=625.64s)]
*  And really all that meant was that we were in network with them, even if it meant not [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=629.0s)]
*  getting reimbursed for all of the ways we were interacting with patients. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=633.2s)]
*  Many ways we were operating as though we were on value based contracts even before we were. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=636.64s)]
*  And so we quickly, I think relatively quickly, progressed from those basic fee for service [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=641.5999999999999s)]
*  contracts to more strategic sub cap agreements. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=647.2399999999999s)]
*  And we were able to do that off of the early experiential data that we were able to provide [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=650.92s)]
*  to them from our initial members that we acquired. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=655.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, you hire people who are mission driven. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  They don't want to give half the population one thing and half another thing. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  And so we decided, you know, OK, North Star is our outcomes. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=664.12s)]
*  And so we focused on getting a lot of proof points and a lot of data showing that our [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=668.72s)]
*  clinical model provides superior outcomes. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=674.12s)]
*  And so we started then consistently delivering our care model across reimbursement types, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=676.8000000000001s)]
*  fee for service and sort of value based. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=683.72s)]
*  Now, we often get the question from entrepreneurs and providers, is the ultimate goal for everyone [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=685.9200000000001s)]
*  to get to full risk, to get to something like global capitation? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=690.48s)]
*  As we've heard before, though, what amount of risk you take on ultimately depends on [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=695.24s)]
*  what levers you can control on the clinical side and what ultimately best aligns your [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=698.84s)]
*  care, your operating and your business models. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=703.24s)]
*  For example, in primary care, care is more continuous. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=706.24s)]
*  It's more longitudinal. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  It covers a broader set of levers and conditions. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=710.24s)]
*  So for that global cap often makes the most sense. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=713.12s)]
*  On the other hand, other more isolated specialty conditions might be a better fit for sub cap [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=716.4s)]
*  care, where you take on a narrower aspect of care and risk for that patient. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=722.76s)]
*  And for more episodic care like surgical episodes, it can be best optimized through bundled [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=726.76s)]
*  payments. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=731.76s)]
*  Let's hear now from Satya Jain, the CEO at Care and Health, which is a marketplace for [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=732.76s)]
*  high value care. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=737.76s)]
*  Surgical care felt like the natural place for us to start because the spend is highly [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=739.76s)]
*  and the cost and quality variation is significantly high in surgical care delivery. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=747.68s)]
*  And we felt that was right for bundled payments. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=753.68s)]
*  For Care, taking on additional risk only adds operational complexity. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=755.68s)]
*  If you are taking an insurance risk in health care, you are governed by very different regulations [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=760.68s)]
*  that are very on risk. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=767.68s)]
*  Taking any kind of risk means your capital requirement to start the business goes up [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=769.8399999999999s)]
*  significantly. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=775.88s)]
*  And we just felt given where we were, we didn't want to raise that kind of money in those [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=776.88s)]
*  early days. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=782.2s)]
*  And so creating a model where we essentially stay risk neutral gave us a faster path to [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=783.2s)]
*  market. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=793.2s)]
*  Wherever on the risk spectrum a company decides to start, success and at risk model fundamentally [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=794.2s)]
*  depends on aligning with other great partners. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=798.84s)]
*  But in a complex landscape of different potential partners, how do you think about the right [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=801.28s)]
*  set of partners to start with? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=805.68s)]
*  We've consistently heard across founders and across our peer colleagues that vision and [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=807.68s)]
*  mission alignment are critical, especially early on. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=811.68s)]
*  And that ultimately starts with aligning around the clinical areas of impact that are most [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=814.68s)]
*  important, as well as sharing a commitment to a value-based approach. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=818.68s)]
*  So let's hear from Mike Kopko, who's the CEO at Pearl Health, where they're building a [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=821.68s)]
*  marketplace that partners with both risk-bearing entities and provider groups to help these [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=826.68s)]
*  providers take on more risk for their patients. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=831.68s)]
*  In healthcare, I think we're in a very dark age still, where which providers should be [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=835.0799999999999s)]
*  managing which patients is really a function of geography and often referral networks and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=839.0799999999999s)]
*  maybe someone that you know or looked up on the internet. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  And we would argue that over time, it's actually going to be much more on who is effective [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=847.0799999999999s)]
*  with risk and which clinical models manage which risk conditions effectively. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=851.0799999999999s)]
*  And so when we look about adding new partners, we want to work with partners that see the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=856.0799999999999s)]
*  future that this type of risk-based management system is going to be around to stay and actually [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=861.48s)]
*  wants to encourage reward in certain cases, create certain subsidies around participating [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=866.48s)]
*  in these early days of the shift to risk and value. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=871.48s)]
*  And so a lot of our partners see that. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=875.48s)]
*  They're thought leaders on how to make that shift and frankly are helping us make the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=877.48s)]
*  cost of participating in those models and the reward of performing well in them very [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=881.48s)]
*  accessible and helpful for the physicians that are taking on that opportunity. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=885.48s)]
*  We've heard similar things from our pair of colleagues as well about how important it [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=890.88s)]
*  is in the early days to have alignment around long-term impact, specifically impact that [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=893.88s)]
*  is tailored to their local community. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=897.88s)]
*  So let's get the take from Sonny Goyal, who's the chief strategy officer at Blue Cross Blue [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=899.88s)]
*  Shield of North Carolina and one of the biggest advocates and champions for new value-based [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=904.88s)]
*  care models. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=908.88s)]
*  Having a deep understanding of our local population, I think is really critical. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=909.88s)]
*  And we have found the most success with those partners that understand that while North [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=914.28s)]
*  Carolina may look like many other states out there, we are different and unique in a lot [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=920.28s)]
*  of ways as well. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=924.28s)]
*  And so getting deep into the communities, into our local populations and understanding [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=925.28s)]
*  that you have to design the solution to really match the specific needs of our people. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=929.28s)]
*  And having strong, aligned first partners, your launch partners are especially important [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=936.28s)]
*  as key drivers as you're getting your business off the ground. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=940.28s)]
*  I'm a strong believer of having a anchor customer to help launch a business. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=943.68s)]
*  And, you know, in essence, they become a co-founder who really understands your stage, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=949.68s)]
*  believes deeply in your vision and really wants the results that they think you're going [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=954.68s)]
*  to be able to unlock. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=959.68s)]
*  If you can get that alignment with an executive sponsor, predominantly one who has the P&L [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=960.68s)]
*  who actually is going to benefit from those, from that value that you're going to create [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=965.68s)]
*  together, I find that they are the ones who can then help train the organization and help, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=970.0799999999999s)]
*  you know, be a river guide through the rapids of these health plans that are often somewhat [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=976.0799999999999s)]
*  difficult. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  And speaking of navigating health plans, how do you get the right stakeholders to the table, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=981.0799999999999s)]
*  especially in the early stages? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=986.0799999999999s)]
*  The good thing about the space that we're in is these problems really matter to people. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=988.0799999999999s)]
*  Like we're not, you know, inventing a problem for them. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=993.0799999999999s)]
*  We're really helping them take on what they recognize is the most urgent challenge in [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=997.48s)]
*  Medicaid care delivery, which is, you know, how do you deliver community-based care that [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1002.48s)]
*  meets people where they're at? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1005.48s)]
*  And so that's usually enough to get the right people to the table. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1007.48s)]
*  Who are the right people to have at the table? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1010.48s)]
*  This will depend somewhat on the partner. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1013.48s)]
*  For example, the needs of a large national payer can be quite different than the needs [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1015.48s)]
*  of a local regional insurer. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1018.48s)]
*  But in both cases, it's better to build broad coalitions, both vertically with executives [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1020.48s)]
*  and business unit owners, and also horizontally across key functions. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1025.88s)]
*  In my experience, there are very few people in these payer organizations who can say yes, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1028.88s)]
*  but there are a lot who can say no. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1034.88s)]
*  And especially when you're doing something that's innovative, that breaks the mold, that [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1036.88s)]
*  challenges their existing processes, the further into the sales, contracting, and [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1041.88s)]
*  implementation process, the more you bump into other parts of the organization. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1049.88s)]
*  And so having this broad coalition that includes having a strong exec sponsor, preferably a [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1054.2800000000002s)]
*  P&L owner at the helm of this ship is most important. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1059.2800000000002s)]
*  But around that person, and you know, that coalition should include contracting, the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1063.2800000000002s)]
*  medical leadership, often the credentialing team, even the lawyers who are going to be [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1069.2800000000002s)]
*  involved, because if there isn't that understanding, it becomes work, and you get a lot of these [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1074.2800000000002s)]
*  stakeholders downstream that are almost antibodies, right? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1080.68s)]
*  And they can come back and try to attack this innovation. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1083.68s)]
*  So larger national partners as some of the most complex organizations in healthcare often [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1085.68s)]
*  require the broadest coalition building. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1090.68s)]
*  And so let's go back to Sunny to hear the payer perspective on this piece. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1092.68s)]
*  When we think about the due diligence and who's conducting it, you know, a lot of time [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1095.68s)]
*  that actually is my team and my division around our strategy and our new ventures team to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1100.68s)]
*  really set up for guiding innovators through really all parts of our organization, critically [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1106.0800000000002s)]
*  obviously engaging with our healthcare division, our clinical division for really the support [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1113.0800000000002s)]
*  and the experts to make sure that these things come to life. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1118.0800000000002s)]
*  And then they're put into our networks and our processes and our procedures in the right [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1121.0800000000002s)]
*  way. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1125.0800000000002s)]
*  Then we are always working with our finance division, because again, what are we driving [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  towards is affordability. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1130.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, then we go into our legal and our health policy teams. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1131.0800000000002s)]
*  And a lot of times they make sure that we are driving in the right direction and lining [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1134.48s)]
*  up with where the government wants us to go, where our consumers want us to go and really [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1137.48s)]
*  being thoughtful about it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1142.48s)]
*  And then last but certainly not least is our is what we call our markets team, whether [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1143.48s)]
*  it's our government team or our commercial team to how do we fit this into their products [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1147.48s)]
*  and to their services to our customers, whether it's the individual or it's to the employer [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1151.48s)]
*  or it's to the governments. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1156.48s)]
*  The first step in scaling at-risk go-to markets is to succeed in early deployments. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1157.48s)]
*  But by definition, success and risk-based contracts is ultimately judged against the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1162.88s)]
*  value or outcomes that are created. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1166.88s)]
*  So because of this, one of the most important steps in laying the foundation for scale is [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1168.88s)]
*  defining how you tactically measure success with partners upfront. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1172.88s)]
*  Now we've heard across founders and across our peer colleagues that you have to define [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1177.88s)]
*  success in terms of what matters most to each specific partner. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1181.88s)]
*  We're focused on affordability and really the total cost of care. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1185.88s)]
*  We have the best solution out there, but it may not be the biggest value or the biggest [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1190.2800000000002s)]
*  impact to what our members need and how do we drive affordability. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1194.2800000000002s)]
*  Sometimes innovators miss that because they're focused on their solution and selling. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1198.2800000000002s)]
*  The question about defining success is not something that you sort of get into at the [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1203.2800000000002s)]
*  end of year one of your partnership. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1207.2800000000002s)]
*  If it is, you're probably in trouble. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1208.2800000000002s)]
*  There's nothing more important than actually getting that defined and not just kind of [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1210.2800000000002s)]
*  But like literally in an Excel sheet, looking at it and saying, does this look like success [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1215.68s)]
*  to you? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1221.68s)]
*  And, you know, then working out the contracts to follow from that. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1222.68s)]
*  Success is often defined on operational and cost outcomes, but picking clinical measures [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1227.68s)]
*  is a key component as well. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1231.68s)]
*  We've consistently heard about the importance of picking measures that are both validated [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1233.68s)]
*  and easily comparable for your partners. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1237.68s)]
*  For example, Eleanor Health focuses on substance use disorders for which there are [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1240.68s)]
*  established clinical measurements already in place that they can use. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1245.0800000000002s)]
*  We focused on psychometrically validated scales and screeners so we can benchmark against [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1248.0800000000002s)]
*  them and say how much better we are. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1254.0800000000002s)]
*  So that's one thing and certainly payers and others care about that. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1256.0800000000002s)]
*  They also care about things that you can compare a little bit easier. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1261.0800000000002s)]
*  We saw significant reductions in ED and inpatient. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1265.0800000000002s)]
*  That was, we collected that through third parties and so we were able to sort of show [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1268.0800000000002s)]
*  in a statistically significant way that we were having this impact across our populations. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1274.48s)]
*  So part of just getting members through these initial fee-for-service contracts, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1279.48s)]
*  the strategy there was just to get enough members, really to get enough data to demonstrate [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1284.48s)]
*  proof points, including experience. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1290.48s)]
*  So MPS actually mattered a lot to the credit of payers. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1293.48s)]
*  Really, that went a long way to actually show all of the engagement that we're having with [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1296.48s)]
*  our members, which is an average of 41 touch points a year, clinically significant interactions, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1300.88s)]
*  ability to reduce TME. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1305.88s)]
*  And on the fee-for-service contract, what that really meant was how are you doing on [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1307.88s)]
*  ER admissions? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1313.88s)]
*  So are you keeping people out of the ER? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1314.88s)]
*  That was a big driver for us. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1317.88s)]
*  How are you doing on A1C readings? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1319.88s)]
*  How are you doing on behavioral health, anxiety? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1322.88s)]
*  And we're able to take all of those things and bring them back to payers and renegotiate [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1326.2800000000002s)]
*  our original contracts to get into a PM-PM sub-cap agreement. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1332.2800000000002s)]
*  Once you've established a successful anchor partnership, the next key question is when [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1336.2800000000002s)]
*  to scale those partnerships. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1341.2800000000002s)]
*  One of the challenges of making these decisions in risk-based contracts is the inherent data [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1343.2800000000002s)]
*  delay that we have in health care, which means that even when the end measures of success [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1348.2800000000002s)]
*  are clearly defined, founders emphasize the need for upstream process and operating measures [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1352.68s)]
*  to help companies know if what you're doing is working and is scalable well ahead of the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1357.68s)]
*  ultimate data readouts that come sometimes years down the line. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1362.68s)]
*  You may elect to ramp up a market before you have a final answer on whether or not it worked [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1365.68s)]
*  financially because with the runout and claims and the reconciliation period and even in [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1372.68s)]
*  Medicaid, retroactive government adjustments on rates, it could be literally 18 months [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1379.0800000000002s)]
*  until you have a financial answer on whether the model worked. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1386.0800000000002s)]
*  Does he need to have the toolkit and the dashboards to know, do we expect this to work? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1391.0800000000002s)]
*  Is it working from the perspective of the non-financial indicators that we can feel [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1397.0800000000002s)]
*  confident? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1402.0800000000002s)]
*  Like most things in health care, it's not a clear path between here and there, between [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1403.0800000000002s)]
*  A and B. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1407.0800000000002s)]
*  You really need to move backwards and think about if these are the end targets that you're [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1408.48s)]
*  trying to hit, be it satisfaction, be it savings, what are then the interim measures that you [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1415.48s)]
*  can come to to get a pretty high degree of confidence that those things are going to [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1421.48s)]
*  emerge? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1425.48s)]
*  If that's utilization changes or quality impact or early indicators of satisfaction or savings. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1426.48s)]
*  And then even go further upstream, right? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1435.88s)]
*  To the degree in which you have process measures in mind. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1437.88s)]
*  So are your processes defined? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1439.88s)]
*  Do they have measures? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1441.88s)]
*  You have a hypothesis as you build your business around what steps will you take in the value [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1442.88s)]
*  stream to unlock that value? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1447.88s)]
*  And I would encourage you to continue to put metrics against those pieces so that you can [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1449.88s)]
*  look at them and say, hey, we feel like we're on the right path. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1453.88s)]
*  With those upstream process and operating metrics in place, how fast should you expand [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1456.88s)]
*  the model? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1462.2800000000002s)]
*  How do you take on additional risk and do a take on additional patient populations? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1463.2800000000002s)]
*  There's a balance between needing to be enough scale so that operationally from a unit economics [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1465.2800000000002s)]
*  perspective, you can make it work and that from an actuarial perspective, you have enough [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1472.2800000000002s)]
*  credibility, but not being at so much scale or being so exposed in your risk that if the [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1477.2800000000002s)]
*  model doesn't work exactly as you hoped in year one, that, you know, it has a hugely [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1485.68s)]
*  negative financial impact on the business. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1491.68s)]
*  As you grow, there are also several approaches and strategies you can take to manage and [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1493.68s)]
*  mitigate the risk that a company is exposed to in value-based and risk-based contracts. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1497.68s)]
*  For Pearl Health, this was especially important as they took an accelerated path to full risk. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1502.68s)]
*  The range, as I would say, is kind of the very kind of more sophisticated models are [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1507.68s)]
*  reinsurance and stop loss policies. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1511.68s)]
*  The more you get in these models, the more you accept yourself from systemic risk and [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1515.0800000000002s)]
*  you can effectively defray that and you have fewer factors that can be incredibly expensive. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1522.0800000000002s)]
*  Small practices, for example, can have a big swing that is incredibly punishing, but a [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1528.0800000000002s)]
*  very large market like Pearl where you're having thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1533.0800000000002s)]
*  of thousands of members is much more immune to those types of swings. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1537.0800000000002s)]
*  Succeeding in value-based and risk-based contracts is a very important step. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1540.0800000000002s)]
*  The impact of value-based and risk-based contracts comes down to having the right set of clinical [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1543.48s)]
*  and operational capabilities. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1547.48s)]
*  And as we've heard from multiple founders, it's critical to build these capabilities [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1549.48s)]
*  from the earliest days. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1552.48s)]
*  Technology and data are really important in order to take risk on populations. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1554.48s)]
*  So from day one, we were, we set up a really strong data infrastructure. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1558.48s)]
*  So we were collecting data, both claims data from payers that enrich by third parties and [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1562.48s)]
*  then enriching it with our own. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1568.48s)]
*  And then we were using our own data to create an [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1570.48s)]
*  parametrically validated scales and screeners so we could evaluate the impact of what we're doing. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1572.48s)]
*  So collecting that data, analyzing that data, making changes to our care model or how we [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1574.48s)]
*  approach people, I think you have to be able to do that, both from a population perspective, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1580.48s)]
*  sort of being able to look at, you know, claims data to say who are the most high risk members, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1586.48s)]
*  how do we risk stratify, but as well being able to iterate and change on your model based [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1590.48s)]
*  on the evidence that you're and the data that you're getting back from your own interactions [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1595.48s)]
*  with patients I think is really important. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1599.48s)]
*  But in these early days, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1602.68s)]
*  when you're building your data infrastructure [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1604.0s)]
*  and your product, what do you buy and what do you build? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1605.48s)]
*  It can be a gamble to say [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1608.56s)]
*  that you're gonna build all that yourself. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1609.72s)]
*  And so what we did is actually we're pretty focused [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1611.56s)]
*  on kind of build versus buy. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1614.6s)]
*  And what we wanted to build was really, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1615.8s)]
*  only the parts of the equation [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1618.32s)]
*  that no one else had created [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1621.1200000000001s)]
*  that were kind of proprietary to us, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1623.16s)]
*  which is how do we identify patients for engagement? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1625.08s)]
*  How do we automate the care pathways? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1628.4s)]
*  How do we give our community health workers [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1630.4s)]
*  that we're training for the first time [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1632.0800000000002s)]
*  the pattern matching of somebody with years of experience? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1633.8400000000001s)]
*  And that all happens through our product [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1636.96s)]
*  that the team is building. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1639.0400000000002s)]
*  But when it came to some of those core instrumentation [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1641.24s)]
*  pieces, it needed to be compatible [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1644.0400000000002s)]
*  with what our health plan partners were seeing. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1646.1200000000001s)]
*  It needs to be compatible with what providers are seeing. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1647.72s)]
*  And so there we made buy decisions [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1650.0400000000002s)]
*  just so that we could effectively be [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1652.44s)]
*  on the same playing field as them [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1654.72s)]
*  and not be too creative, too far ahead or too far behind [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1656.04s)]
*  in how we were receiving, communicating data [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1662.04s)]
*  and information with them. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1665.56s)]
*  Beyond the data infrastructure [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1666.8799999999999s)]
*  and the analytical capabilities, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1668.08s)]
*  scaling at-risk models often also requires being able [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1669.84s)]
*  to deliver care in novel ways. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1672.76s)]
*  It often requires multimodal care, interdisciplinary care [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1675.04s)]
*  and more continuous care approaches. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1678.12s)]
*  We do have brick and mortar clinics. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1680.48s)]
*  We do have field-based teams that can connect [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1682.04s)]
*  with our community members in person. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1684.12s)]
*  And then we have a really strong digital infrastructure [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1686.48s)]
*  as well. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1688.8799999999999s)]
*  I think that not delivering just a point solution [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1689.72s)]
*  of like sort of one thing, but being able to address [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1691.64s)]
*  more of the needs of a population is important [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1695.04s)]
*  in those risk models as well. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1697.84s)]
*  This adds quite a bit of complexity [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1699.32s)]
*  to risk-based business relative [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1700.96s)]
*  to its free-for-service analogs. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1702.52s)]
*  And because of this, we consistently heard from founders [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1704.68s)]
*  how important it is to have the right expertise [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1706.92s)]
*  around the table and to build these capabilities early on [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1708.96s)]
*  as companies take off on the glide path to risk. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1712.04s)]
*  I think the short of it is you kind of have to bring in [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1714.96s)]
*  a lot of the expertise and process [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1718.4s)]
*  that you might see in a larger later company earlier [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1722.44s)]
*  if you're gonna move down this path [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1726.28s)]
*  because the stakes are so much higher. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1728.04s)]
*  You don't do this because you think you're gonna have [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1730.1200000000001s)]
*  an outcome that you can point to in 12 or 18 months. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1733.52s)]
*  You do this because you think that over a many year period, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1736.68s)]
*  potentially a decade or more, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1740.44s)]
*  that you're gonna make a real impact on care delivery. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1742.6s)]
*  And you kind of, you have to have that patience [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1746.1999999999998s)]
*  and time horizon. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1748.8799999999999s)]
*  Everyone on our team have it, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1750.6799999999998s)]
*  and I think equally important, our investors have it. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1751.8799999999999s)]
*  While it's still early days for value-based care [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1754.3999999999999s)]
*  and digital health, we're already seeing [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1756.28s)]
*  how it can rewire our healthcare system [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1758.08s)]
*  and also the patient experience [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1760.4399999999998s)]
*  within our healthcare system. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1761.8799999999999s)]
*  As risk-based digital health companies grow, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1763.6799999999998s)]
*  some have become marketplaces or enablement layers [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1766.7199999999998s)]
*  that span between payers and providers. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1768.9599999999998s)]
*  We're also seeing others that are effectively becoming [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1771.12s)]
*  payers themselves as they take on global capitated risk [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1773.32s)]
*  and partner with a range of other providers. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1776.52s)]
*  And then others are in pass to become care platforms [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1779.9599999999998s)]
*  with a broad range of clinical services. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1782.08s)]
*  So how would we look at these companies [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1784.8s)]
*  from an investment lens? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1786.32s)]
*  Well, we heard earlier how these risk-based contracting [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1787.6399999999999s)]
*  models will generally require a fairly non-trivial [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1791.36s)]
*  set of investments into both the clinical aspect [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1794.9599999999998s)]
*  of the business as well as risk management. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1797.6s)]
*  And so, first and foremost, we simply wanna know, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1800.24s)]
*  does your plan appropriately account [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1803.28s)]
*  for all the necessary components? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1805.8s)]
*  For instance, we're certainly gonna look at [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1808.08s)]
*  the talent on your team and whether you either [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1809.8s)]
*  have internal experts or plan to hire folks [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1812.56s)]
*  who have actually implemented value-based care models [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1815.8s)]
*  in the past, and ideally also have successfully negotiated [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1818.32s)]
*  risk-based contracts in the past. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1821.8s)]
*  Different levels of risk will require different levels [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1823.84s)]
*  of capital reserves, whether statutory or otherwise. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1826.64s)]
*  And so, again, does your use of funds plan [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1829.16s)]
*  give you a sufficient runway to actually get to [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1832.0400000000002s)]
*  a strong set of milestones for a follow-on round [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1834.44s)]
*  down the road? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1837.5600000000002s)]
*  A second thing we'd look for is just whether you've selected [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1838.72s)]
*  a patient population for which value-based care [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1841.8400000000001s)]
*  actually makes sense. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1844.16s)]
*  The market readiness for value-based care [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1845.2s)]
*  in different areas of the market is definitely [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1847.52s)]
*  highly variable and also a moving target. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1850.0400000000002s)]
*  And so validation that you've chosen an area [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1852.8400000000001s)]
*  where the timing is likely right is super critical. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1856.32s)]
*  And related to that, there could also be regulatory [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1860.6399999999999s)]
*  tailwinds that are relevant to your population. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1862.4399999999998s)]
*  We've seen this with kidney care, with primary care, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1865.32s)]
*  with oncology. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1867.6s)]
*  And then finally, a third area that we would evaluate [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1868.84s)]
*  is just what is the actual plan and roadmap to full risk [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1870.9199999999998s)]
*  or whatever level of risk you ultimately seek to take? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1876.32s)]
*  How do you generate the sufficient set of clinical evidence [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1879.6s)]
*  to be able to sell those outcomes to payers? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1882.24s)]
*  So even if you're starting with simple fee-for-service [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1885.76s)]
*  contracts, just having a well articulated roadmap [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1888.16s)]
*  and a set of assumptions for what you'd have to believe [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1891.84s)]
*  to get to higher levels of risk over time is something [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1894.68s)]
*  that we'd love to see in the earlier phases, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1897.84s)]
*  including things like pricing and margin assumptions [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1900.2s)]
*  and obviously some sort of thesis on TAM. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1903.0s)]
*  And relatedly, we'd obviously wanna know, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1906.08s)]
*  do you have payer partners either lined up [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1909.24s)]
*  or a hypothesis about which payer partners are ready [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1912.1599999999999s)]
*  to collaborate with you in this fashion [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1915.9199999999998s)]
*  for the given patient population that you're focused on? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1918.04s)]
*  So thank you so much to our founders and payer executives [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1920.6s)]
*  who shared their perspectives in this piece [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1923.6399999999999s)]
*  on risk-based contracting for digital health companies. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1926.2399999999998s)]
*  And to all of you for joining us to listen, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1929.32s)]
*  and we'd love to hear from you if you have any thoughts [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1931.36s)]
*  or questions and hope that you'll continue to follow along [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1933.0s)]
*  as we roll out the rest of our GoToMarket Playbook series. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttVtsnN30g&t=1936.2399999999998s)]
