Video Description: Aging has always been inevitable -- and mysterious in when and how it happens.

But now, we're finally beginning to understand the processes behind the deterioration of tissues, cells, functions -- collectively described as "aging" -- that is also the greatest single cause of countless chronic diseases. If we can understand aging, we can perhaps begin to slow it.

So in this short talk first delivered at a16z's annual Summit, BIOAGE CEO Kristen Fortney (and PhD in medical biophysics as well as former fellow of the Ellison Medical Foundation / American Federation for Aging Research) explores the most promising research and therapies being developed in the space right now -- no longer the stuff of science fiction, but of scientific frontier. How will this work change the way we fight all the major age-related diseases (like Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease, and others)... and how will it change how long we ultimately live?

# Extending Human Lifespan
**a16z Bio:** [December 23, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk)
*  So, I work on extending human lifespans because I believe this is the most powerful way to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=0.0s)]
*  address chronic disease. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=10.88s)]
*  In the United States today, the two major leading causes of death are heart disease [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  and cancer. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=16.92s)]
*  Now, these are fundamentally very different diseases, different symptoms, different progressions, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=17.92s)]
*  but they share the same underlying driving risk factor, which is how old you are. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=22.5s)]
*  Now, if it were possible to address aging itself rather than addressing these diseases [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  one at a time, wouldn't that be much higher impact? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=33.44s)]
*  So the average woman now in the United States lives to be 81 years of age. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  And scientists have estimated that if we could cure all cancer, that would only get her up [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=42.0s)]
*  to 85, that would add only four years to the average lifespan. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=45.8s)]
*  Similarly, if we could cure all heart disease, that would only get her to 86. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=49.64s)]
*  But for the past two decades now, we've sort of started to build this menu of interventions [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=55.72s)]
*  that can reproducibly make mice live longer. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=59.92s)]
*  So we can make mice live about 20 to 30% longer. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=62.16s)]
*  And if that translated directly to humans, that would be phenomenal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=66.16s)]
*  That would get the average lifespan up to 113 by targeting aging directly rather than [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=70.36s)]
*  targeting individual diseases one at a time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  And what's really key, too, is this would be an additional 30 years of healthy life. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  So I want to distinguish now between two important concepts, lifespan and healthspan. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=82.32s)]
*  Lifespan is how long you live, and healthspan is how long you're healthy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  And right now, lifespan and healthspan are very different. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=90.22s)]
*  So she would leave to 81 here, but the average healthspan is only 62. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=93.28s)]
*  And that's the age at which you get your first chronic age-related disease. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=98.32s)]
*  And all these interventions that we have already done over and over again in mammal systems [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=101.58s)]
*  not only extend lifespan, they dramatically improve the healthspan. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  Now you'd think that given how important translating aging was and how transformative [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=109.6s)]
*  potential it has for medicine, we'd be pouring a lot of money into this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=114.66s)]
*  We'd be trying to solve this problem. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  But in fact, it's dramatically underfunded relative to its importance. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  So in particular, the NIH, which is all the spending on research on medical research, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=124.0s)]
*  only about 1% of their $37 billion annual budget goes to research on basic mechanisms [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  of aging. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=134.12s)]
*  And similarly, if you look at all of Medicare spending as a whole, that's an even smaller [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=135.64s)]
*  number. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=139.32s)]
*  And part of the reason for that is that aging is a very young science. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=140.72s)]
*  So it's only been for a few years that we've been able to do these things. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=144.04s)]
*  And today I'm going to give you a brief tour on sort of the history of aging research and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=148.42s)]
*  what we're discovering now that's going to translate into human health in the near future. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=153.12s)]
*  So as I said, aging was a young science. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  And until the 1990s, even in academia, very few people worked on it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=160.42s)]
*  And the idea was that aging is so complicated. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=164.24s)]
*  There are so many different things going wrong as you get older. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=166.2s)]
*  How could you possibly do one simple thing and have a dramatic effect on lifespan? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=169.12s)]
*  Is that even possible? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=173.24s)]
*  And that sort of idea changed in 1993 when Cynthia Kenyon published this paper about [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=174.8s)]
*  this worm, C. elegans. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=180.56s)]
*  So this worm usually only lives two weeks. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=181.88s)]
*  And she showed that by deleting a single gene in the worm, you could double its lifespan, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=184.96s)]
*  which was just amazing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=189.16s)]
*  And that sort of really brought the field to increased prominence. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=190.88s)]
*  And the next decade, people spent sort of mapping out all the different ways you could [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=193.82s)]
*  genetically modify invertebrates like yeast, flies and worms and influence lifespan. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=197.86s)]
*  And they identified several hundred ways you could do this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=203.18s)]
*  So not just one or two ways, but several hundred ways. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=205.62s)]
*  So that's great. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  We now have really long lived worms. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  But what about mammals? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=211.58s)]
*  So in the 1960s, a group of Canadian scientists sailed across the Pacific to Easter Island [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=213.68s)]
*  to study the isolated population there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  And while they were there, they collected a whole bunch of soil samples and brought [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  them back to study. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=224.86s)]
*  And just by luck, they found that this drug, Repamiocin, which is produced by one of the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=226.86s)]
*  bacteria there, was really sort of bioactive and did all sorts of interesting things. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=232.14000000000001s)]
*  And the idea that this drug could impact aging was first sort of tested in like a very large [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=236.9s)]
*  study in 2009. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=241.9s)]
*  And this is I would consider this to be one of the first drugs shown to reproducibly extend [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=243.82000000000002s)]
*  mouse lifespan. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  It's a very solid result. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  It's been done over and over again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=249.42000000000002s)]
*  And basically, they gave this drug to mice starting from middle age, and it boosted their [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=251.46s)]
*  lifespan by 14% on average and also substantially increased their health spans. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=255.26s)]
*  They got sick at later ages, although biomarkers of disease were improved. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  And this is sort of like, you know, the early 2000s is when people really started to map [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=263.94s)]
*  out all the different longevity pathways in mice. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=267.7s)]
*  Excitingly, this is one of the first sort of basic aging discoveries that's been translated [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=271.06s)]
*  into humans. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=275.74s)]
*  So there's a company, Restore Bio, just spent out of Novartis a year ago, IPO'd earlier [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=276.74s)]
*  this year, that's taken this drug into humans. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=281.38s)]
*  And they just published their phase 2b data this summer, showing that rapamycin can improve [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=285.84s)]
*  certain aspects of immunosin essence. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=291.14s)]
*  So as you get older, your immune system doesn't work quite so well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=293.24s)]
*  And people who took rapamycin had 30% fewer respiratory infections. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=296.06s)]
*  So the first proof of principle felt like a really basic aging discovery taken all the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=300.74s)]
*  way to the clinic. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=304.86s)]
*  Another really exciting discovery in aging research is to do with senescence. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=307.58s)]
*  So when your cells get damaged, if they get really, really damaged either by DNA or by [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  replicating too much, they senesce, which means they no longer function, they can no [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=316.5s)]
*  longer replicate, and they actually secrete these toxic factors that are bad for neighboring [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=321.26s)]
*  cells. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=325.46s)]
*  And there was this hypothesis in the aging field for a couple decades that if you could [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=326.46s)]
*  simply delete these cells, that would be good for the animals aging. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=330.9s)]
*  Again, this was first tested directly in 2011 and then established even more in 2015. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=334.74s)]
*  But if you could delete these cells, that could boost lifespan as much as 30% and health [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=340.06s)]
*  span as well. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=344.86s)]
*  And you can see that's really apparent from this image here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=346.06s)]
*  So these two mice are the same age. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=348.14s)]
*  The one on the left is a regular mouse. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=350.34s)]
*  The one on the right is a mouse with its senescent cells deleted. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=351.84s)]
*  And you can see the regular mouse is losing hair. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=354.98s)]
*  Its spine is bent. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=357.09999999999997s)]
*  It's not doing so well. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  And just this one simple intervention can have a really dramatic impact. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=359.34s)]
*  And there's a company working on this as well, Unity Biotechnology, which just started their [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=363.38s)]
*  first phase one study for osteoarthritis earlier this year. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=367.42s)]
*  So this one of these drugs went into humans just earlier this year. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=370.7s)]
*  The final result on aging that I want to tell you about is all about blood. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=374.22s)]
*  So there's this really intriguing finding that factors that are circulating in blood [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=378.14s)]
*  can dramatically impact how you age. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=382.1s)]
*  There was actually this discovery that inspired the work that we do at BioAge. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=383.82s)]
*  So in particular, the key experiment that showed that blood could impact aging was this [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=389.02s)]
*  very sort of really kind of Frankenstein experiment where you take an old mouse and you take a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=392.7s)]
*  young mouse and you sew them together. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=396.85999999999996s)]
*  You surgically attach them such that after a month, new capillaries form. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=398.41999999999996s)]
*  They share a bloodstream. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=403.06s)]
*  And what this means is that the old mouse is getting exposed to young blood. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=404.58s)]
*  And it turns out this is really good for the old mouse in a lot of different ways. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=408.06s)]
*  As you might expect, it's also really bad for the young mouse to be exposed to old blood. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=411.53999999999996s)]
*  Because blood travels everywhere and impacts every organ system, you see sort of improvements [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=418.1s)]
*  across the board. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=422.12s)]
*  So in particular, people set down greater skeletal muscle rejuvenation, better olfaction, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=423.48s)]
*  a better sense of smell, and even improved neurogenesis in these old animals exposed [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=427.70000000000005s)]
*  to young blood. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=431.42s)]
*  So really very exciting. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=432.42s)]
*  And one of the key papers that sort of launched this field was published in 2005, so again, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=433.42s)]
*  just over a decade ago. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=438.98s)]
*  So blood works, young blood works, but we don't actually know what the causal factors [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=442.5s)]
*  are. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=447.3s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to do at BioAge. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=448.62s)]
*  We're trying to enumerate, figure out what it is in blood that can have a positive impact [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=450.1s)]
*  on aging, and drug that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=454.06s)]
*  And we take a genomics and AI approach to this problem, of course. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=456.86s)]
*  And what we do is we analyze blood samples from young people, sorry, from people who [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=461.34000000000003s)]
*  live short lives and from people who live very long lives. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=465.54s)]
*  Specifically, we have healthy aging cohorts. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=468.94s)]
*  And we take blood samples from all of them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=472.74s)]
*  And we really deeply interrogate those to measure everything that there is in a blood [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=474.7s)]
*  sample. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=477.62s)]
*  So we do the metabolome, the proteome, the genome, sort of the full spectrum of things [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=478.62s)]
*  that's in a blood sample, and prioritize aging targets. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=482.42s)]
*  So to give you an example, one of the targets we're working on now is a protein that circulates [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=486.38s)]
*  in your blood. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=490.7s)]
*  And we discovered that humans who have higher levels of this protein live longer, are less [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=491.94s)]
*  frail, and are protected from disease. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=495.98s)]
*  Furthermore, when we injected this protein into very old mice, it improved several aspects [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  of their health. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=502.86s)]
*  And we're now trying to drug this protein. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=503.94s)]
*  It's really key, too, that there's not just one blood factor that impacts aging. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=506.66s)]
*  There are many. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=509.46000000000004s)]
*  And at BioAge, we're building out a platform to enumerate all those factors, to validate [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=510.54s)]
*  them in vivo and mouse aging models, and then to drug them. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=514.74s)]
*  So I think now, just in the last few years, we're finally entering really the human era [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=518.14s)]
*  of aging science, which is going to be a lot more translationally relevant to human diseases. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=522.42s)]
*  There's a couple other discoveries and sort of projects in this area that I'm very excited [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=527.38s)]
*  about. I'm just going to mention to you briefly. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=531.82s)]
*  One is the genetics of exceptional human longevity. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=534.86s)]
*  So this woman here, Lila Denmark, lived until she was 114 years old and practiced medicine [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=537.86s)]
*  until she was 104. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=543.86s)]
*  So she retired 40 years later than most people do, which is just amazing. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=545.86s)]
*  So we call that a super centenarian. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=550.86s)]
*  And there are these sort of families that are genetically enriched for this outlier, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=552.86s)]
*  sort of longevity outliers. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=557.86s)]
*  I love this image. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=559.86s)]
*  This is four siblings when they're all children, then again, when they're all over 100. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=561.86s)]
*  So I think that studying the genetics that might drive this, might explain this, is another [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=565.86s)]
*  really good practical translational way to find factors that might modulate longevity. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=570.86s)]
*  The final example that I want to mention is mining electronic health records and repurposing [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=576.86s)]
*  drugs. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=581.86s)]
*  So there's a number of drugs now that we've been taking for decades. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=582.86s)]
*  And it was actually this kind of approach that led to the discovery that metformin might [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=584.86s)]
*  be an anti-aging drug. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=589.86s)]
*  So metformin is a first-line therapy for diabetes. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=590.86s)]
*  Millions of people have been taking it for decades. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=593.86s)]
*  And there's a paper that came out a few years ago where they looked retrospectively and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=595.86s)]
*  saw that, hey, those diabetics that were taking metformin for decades were protected from [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=599.86s)]
*  cancer and seemed to be living longer than other people. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=603.86s)]
*  And this is a really exciting approach for those therapies that have that data. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=606.86s)]
*  So just to summarize, I've told you about three different ways we've extended life so [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=611.86s)]
*  far in animals, genetic interventions, drugs, and blood. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=615.86s)]
*  So if these all work, how long can we expect to live? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=621.86s)]
*  How far will this get us? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=624.86s)]
*  And the really important point is that three different therapies are already in the clinic [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=627.86s)]
*  today. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=631.86s)]
*  So as I mentioned, there are drugs targeting senescence, metformin, and there are drugs [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=632.86s)]
*  targeting rapamycin being tested in clinical trials now. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=636.86s)]
*  And I think that could already add 10 to 20 years of healthy lifespan. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=639.86s)]
*  Going forward in the future, I think it's a really important point to mention that there [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=643.86s)]
*  is no hard biological limit on how long we can live. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=647.86s)]
*  And these are a couple really fascinating examples. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=650.86s)]
*  Bowhead whales, their average lifespan is over 200 years, so they're a mammal like us. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=653.86s)]
*  In bristlecone pines, the tree can live to be over 5,000. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=659.86s)]
*  So that's all, and I hope that you're excited as I am about the potential of aging science to [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=663.86s)]
*  really transform medicine and improve late life health. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=668.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=671.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leI70P-rEAk&t=677.86s)]
