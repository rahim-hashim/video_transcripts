Video Description: B2C2B — also known as bottom up — has helped companies like Slack, Zoom, Dropbox, and other software companies break into B2B. Now B2C2B is coming to digital health, as a wave of startups are first selling products and services directly to consumers, and then when they reach a critical mass moving into insurance companies, employers, and other organizations.
But executing these two go-to-markets in parallel adds complexity. In this video, our team talks to six leading digital health builders — from Maven, Benchling, Buoy Health, Marley Medical, Bold, and Butterfly — for their takes on eight of the most important questions B2C2B digital health startups have to answer.
*How do you acquire users? [9:02]
*How do you build an engaging consumer product? [12:37]
*How do you price for consumer? [15:27]
*When do you go B2B? [18:54]
*How do you find your B2B buyer and product-market fit in the enterprise? [20:43]
*How do you sell B2B? [22:41]
*How do you balance two GTMs at scale? [25:33]
*What's the role of professional services? [27:40]

# B2C2B in Digital Health, a founder's playbook
**a16z Bio:** [December 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw)
*  Hi, everyone. I'm Julie. And I'm Jay. And we're really excited to be here kicking off [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=0.0s)]
*  the series about go to market and digital health. One of the biggest dimensions of evolution in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=25.48s)]
*  digital health, arguably over the last few years has been how companies are actually coming to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=30.04s)]
*  market and how new products and services are being distributed to end users and how these [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=34.16s)]
*  products and services are getting monetized. And, you know, as a founder who started a company over [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=38.72s)]
*  10 years ago at this point, just the sheer number and, you know, level of sophistication with which [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=43.28s)]
*  digital health companies are coming to market is just completely mind blowing. So some of the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=48.8s)]
*  examples that we're going to cover in later playbooks include things like selling to SMBs, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=52.72s)]
*  two sided networks, risk based contracting with payers, and then finally the emergence of these [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=58.44s)]
*  new channel distribution platforms. But in this current session, what we're going to do is cover [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=63.8s)]
*  this concept of B2C2B, or what you might call the bottoms up top down sales motion. This is something [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=68.12s)]
*  that's similar, it's kind of the healthcare version of a trend that we've seen play out in B2B [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=75.88s)]
*  software. So, you know, you might think about Slack or Zoom or Dropbox or these products that you as [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=79.8s)]
*  an individual user can obviously adopt. But then what these companies are then doing is saying, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=86.6s)]
*  okay, now there's a critical mass of these users, and they might all work for the same company, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=90.92s)]
*  let's actually parlay that bottoms up motion into an enterprise sale to that company, and also [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  potentially introduce more advanced features that are more enterprise grade. And so, you know, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  that's really the motion that we're seeing play out in healthcare. And I'll pass it off to Jay. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=107.52s)]
*  Jay, can you kind of walk us through why you think we're seeing this now in healthcare, when we [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=111.88s)]
*  didn't really see a lot of this kind of activity in the past? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=116.84s)]
*  So we're seeing digital health companies sell directly to the end user before going to the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=119.56s)]
*  enterprise buyer with increasing frequency. And there's probably a number of reasons driving that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=124.32s)]
*  trend. But I think there's at least four that we should call out. Two on the consumer side, and two [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=129.64s)]
*  on the enterprise side. On the consumer side, there is an increasingly tech forward consumer and end [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=134.84s)]
*  user driving healthcare purchasing. We all are delighted by our technology enabled experiences in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  other parts of our lives. We get to call a car, order food, purchase clothes, pay a friend, all [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=147.0s)]
*  with a tap and a swipe on our phone. And so we expect intuitive virtual first experiences in our [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=154.52s)]
*  healthcare system, especially after the work from home life that we've adopted in 2020 and 2021. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=160.08s)]
*  And oh, by the way, those same consumers have far more discretion over and are steering a lot more [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=167.08s)]
*  of the healthcare spend themselves. There is a recent report estimating nationwide out of pocket [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  spending on health, i.e. not reimbursed by insurance, is set to hit almost 500 billion in the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  US in 2021, and projected to grow to about 800 billion by 2026. And then on the enterprise side, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=183.72s)]
*  we frequently hear from many senior enterprise buyers, chief information officers, chief human [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=191.56s)]
*  resource officers, and other executives about the record number of vendors pitching them new [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=197.24s)]
*  digital health solutions. This vendor fatigue is leading to a bottleneck. As a result, there are [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=202.48s)]
*  many promising B2B digital health solutions out there that just don't make it through the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=208.56s)]
*  purchasing funnel. And that third trend seemingly coincides with the fourth, which is a rising bar [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=213.04s)]
*  for validation. Enterprise buyers and healthcare and life sciences increasingly expect evidence [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  that the solution works before buying. But for digital health startups, this creates a chicken [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  and egg problem. How do you prove ROI without people using your product? B2C2B makes it possible [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  to go to the enterprise and say, hey, 100 or 1000 of your employees, your members, your [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=237.32s)]
*  constituents are using this offering and are getting value out of it. We've seen B2C2B work [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=242.44s)]
*  across a number of areas, including care navigation, women's health, behavioral health, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=247.64s)]
*  and many more. In fact, there are a number of different flavors of B2C2B. So when we talk about [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=252.6s)]
*  consumers and end users, we could be talking about patients, employees, clinicians, or medical [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=259.04s)]
*  researchers. When we talk about businesses, we could be talking about employers, providers, payers, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=265.0s)]
*  or life sciences organizations. And while we as investors see B2C2B as a significant trend, we are [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  fortunate in our jobs to meet and work with some of the best digital health companies today. And so [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=277.64s)]
*  we interviewed founders and builders from some of those companies to ask them the toughest [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  questions that come up for B2C2B digital health companies. How do you acquire consumers? How do [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=286.76s)]
*  you build a product that keeps them engaged? How do you price the consumer product? When is it time [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  to go B2B? How do you find your business buyer and product market fit with the enterprise? How do [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=297.36s)]
*  you actually sell to the enterprise? How do you balance two motions, one to the consumer and one [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=303.36s)]
*  to the business at scale? And what's the role of professional services? But we started our interviews [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=308.92s)]
*  with the most basic question. Given the complexity of B2C2B, why are founders going this way instead [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=314.76s)]
*  of sticking to a more traditional and tried and true commercial motion? While B2C2B can be more [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=321.0s)]
*  complex to execute, it gives startups the power to acquire and engage users directly without first [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=326.48s)]
*  contracting with the payer. As we heard from serial digital health entrepreneur Chris Hoag, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  whose most recent startup Marley Medical is developing a virtual first clinic for patients [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=337.0s)]
*  with poorly managed disease. In Marley's case, the consumers are people diagnosed with chronic [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=342.32s)]
*  diseases and the businesses are the payers that pay for the healthcare services that those folks [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  receive. In order to understand B2C2B, we need to understand the B2B2C motion and why this is [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=352.24s)]
*  taken over. And the reason was by there was really no other options. And so if you're not in the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=358.72s)]
*  normal classification system, you have to go direct to the payer, who's either the payer or [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=364.32s)]
*  an employer and contract directly on the product side of the house for a new product. And one of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  the things that we're thinking about now is now with virtual care, we are a normal product. It is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=374.16s)]
*  a normal clinical service and it is in the eyes of a payer, they know how to pay for these types [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=380.56s)]
*  of services. And so can we invert the model and focus on our growth, focus on patient acquisition [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=386.4s)]
*  in a direct to consumer motion? And there's many ways that you could do that online through [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=394.88s)]
*  referrals or whatever, but control the ability to bring patients in and then still get paid by [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=399.76s)]
*  payers because now we're a traditional service. So that could look as an in-network provider, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=405.28s)]
*  if you can figure out a code stack that works for you and covers the services. It could be [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=410.4s)]
*  in capitated arrangements, but you're getting paid on these patients you're acquiring directly. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=415.84s)]
*  So in a nutshell, the B2C2B motion is trying to control the growth through direct patient [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  acquisition so I can build up my own funnels and channels to acquire patients, but then still get [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=427.67999999999995s)]
*  paid by the traditional system of payers and employers. The power of direct acquisition carries [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=432.88s)]
*  with it a number of benefits. When digital health companies get to engage their end consumer earlier, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=439.84s)]
*  the result is often better products and better healthcare. Companies reach product market fit [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=445.76s)]
*  faster because they're able to iterate and improve the product to keep acquiring users. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=451.04s)]
*  Get enough of those users and you can use that as a wedge to sell into businesses. Entering the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=456.48s)]
*  enterprise with momentum and utilization data can help you shortcut an otherwise long enterprise [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=461.92s)]
*  sales cycle. Now the biggest challenge we hear about with B2C2B is that you're signing yourself [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=467.52000000000004s)]
*  up to execute two go-to-market motions in parallel with the limited resources of a startup. The upside [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=473.36s)]
*  though is that if you achieve a high engagement and stickiness in both motions, you're unlocking [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=479.76s)]
*  a more resilient business model with greater long-term defensibility. To this end, we heard [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  from Kate, the founder of Maven, a women's and family health platform and marketplace, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=490.4s)]
*  that B2C2B can also make it easier to show earlier indication that things are working. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=495.2s)]
*  Because investors didn't really know as much about digital health, you just when you raise money have [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=501.35999999999996s)]
*  to show momentum. We had to show some kind of momentum at every single fundraise and we needed [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=506.96s)]
*  a certain amount of capital in the early days to build out our product, be operational in all 50 [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=513.6s)]
*  states so that we could sell into the enterprise. We also just needed to show a certain amount of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=518.56s)]
*  consumer momentum because our story of the investors was, hey, we've launched this new virtual [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=524.64s)]
*  clinic for women's and family health. Consumers love it and now we're taking it into the enterprise. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=530.16s)]
*  That was a much better story and showed traction than just, hey, we have this thesis that this [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=536.56s)]
*  is an important category and we have two small companies to pilot with. Will you fund us? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=544.96s)]
*  In the early stages, the goal is about acquiring users. But how do you find and reach them? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=550.96s)]
*  A lot of that comes down to what one founder called consumer channel fit. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=556.72s)]
*  Different businesses have different end consumers and if you understand where your specific end [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=561.2s)]
*  users are looking for digital health information, whether it's online on Facebook or offline in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=565.9200000000001s)]
*  community gatherings, you can acquire them at a lower cost. For instance, Butterfly generated [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=570.96s)]
*  initial interest for its point of care ultrasound devices by targeting the most influential clinicians. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  There are people that are deeply passionate about point of care ultrasound and so we tapped into [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  that. We tapped into those folks. We looked at who was the most researched. We look at what centers [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=590.08s)]
*  they were in. It was very carefully targeting them and then of course we were at the major [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=594.72s)]
*  trade shows back then. I'll never forget the first conference I went to at Butterfly. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=600.4s)]
*  You walk around the trade show floor and all the booths were empty. Ours would have a line [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=604.48s)]
*  in every direction. In another example of consumer channel fit, Maven tried Facebook ads but found [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=609.92s)]
*  they just didn't do as well at reaching their target demographic as other channels did. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=616.24s)]
*  There are two things that we did. First, giveaway marketing. Giveaway marketing is, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=621.04s)]
*  for those people who don't know what it is, it's when you partner up with a lot of other [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=627.5999999999999s)]
*  like-minded brands. You find a prize. You then blast your customer bases to sign up for the prize [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=631.12s)]
*  and then you get email lists and then off the email lists you then try to convert people to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=639.52s)]
*  use your product. We did this very early on. That was one of the biggest marketing channels [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=645.76s)]
*  that we went out the door with in 2015. One of our early investors was an early investor in [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=653.2s)]
*  Noma, which is a wonderful restaurant in Copenhagen that everyone wanted to go to. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=658.4000000000001s)]
*  Now that I'm seeing giveaway marketing and what people will sign up for, it's like, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  oh, here's a hat. Then all these people sign up to win a hat. We offered an all-expenses-paid trip [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=671.44s)]
*  to Noma in Copenhagen. It was awesome. Then we went out to all these brands like [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=678.24s)]
*  Daily Harvest, consumer brands. Then we launched it. Then we got, I think, I don't know, something [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=686.32s)]
*  like 20,000 emails. All of a sudden we were like, wow, 20,000 names of women from like-minded brands [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=696.88s)]
*  that now we can go market Maven to. It was a lot of work and we had someone on our team [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=704.8s)]
*  doing this full-time, but it was from a cost standpoint, it was pretty cheap. Then off the [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=713.04s)]
*  back of that, we would run consumer campaigns to drive engagement in the product. One of our [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=718.4799999999999s)]
*  earliest consumer campaigns that was really successful was called Therapist Speed Dating. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  What we did is we cut down our therapy appointments to 10-minute increments. Then we would offer free [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=730.0s)]
*  therapists speed dating to find a therapist for you to then book your therapy appointment. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=738.48s)]
*  We would get the emails from these giveaways and then we would go drive this offer and campaign [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=743.7600000000001s)]
*  into our product that was just ours. We started to get consumer volume off the back of some of this. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=750.48s)]
*  That was one motion. The other motion was honestly, we just did field marketing. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=757.52s)]
*  Of course, acquiring users only matters if they stay engaged. That comes down to building a product [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=764.64s)]
*  that actually meets their needs while also preparing for the complexities that come with [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=770.64s)]
*  scaling a digital health product. The key challenge is to not build a product that you think people [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=775.6s)]
*  are going to need and use, but to really work backwards from the problem. I think one of the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=783.44s)]
*  challenges that folks got into with B2B2C is that that isn't so acute. You're able to build [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=788.72s)]
*  something that you can pitch well to buyers, but it might not be something that fits a problem that [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=796.32s)]
*  actual patients and users need to solve. I think then you have to then build incrementally. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  I think that the risk of doing, especially with a direct consumer acquisition approach, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=812.16s)]
*  is you have to try to break it down. What is a small unit that I could try to sell to this person [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=817.68s)]
*  or try to acquire them into? What you're trying to do is prove that there's demand, prove that people [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=823.36s)]
*  want this product or at least are willing to engage with it, and then build it out over time. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=829.68s)]
*  Of course, the big challenge with health care versus a consumer product is that this is health [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=836.4s)]
*  care. This is health data. This is very meaningful stuff. There's a minimum chassis that you need [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=843.12s)]
*  in order to do that. You can't just start throwing out medical recommendations and see if they land. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=852.32s)]
*  It doesn't work that way. I think the challenge is finding that balance of building something [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=858.64s)]
*  really small and atomic, but building it well so that you're still doing everything right. You're a [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=864.08s)]
*  mini HIPAA compliant platform. Even if you're just bringing people in online and HIPAA doesn't apply [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=871.52s)]
*  to you, you're already thinking about how you're managing people's data and so on. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=876.16s)]
*  We heard something similar from SAGI at BenchLink, an informatics platform for life sciences [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=882.24s)]
*  researchers. They started by giving away their product to academic researchers and then staying [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=886.48s)]
*  close to their early users to iterate on the product. You need to build for a very small group [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=891.76s)]
*  that you can then logically expand pretty easily. If we can get one academic lab being really [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=896.72s)]
*  successful in, let's say, doing molecular biology research, why can't we get a second? Why can't we [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=902.16s)]
*  get a third? Rather than trying to go broad, we were just very narrow and pointed, but the space [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=907.12s)]
*  we were in had a lot of room for expansion. That's how we thought about it. If 10 people [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=911.92s)]
*  or 100 people were totally addicted to the software, that was a really good sign. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=919.44s)]
*  One of the chances that we found just the exact 100 people who would be completely addicted, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=924.1600000000001s)]
*  and there'd be no one else after that. I think I'd reach more focus in the early days for most [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=927.6s)]
*  companies. Another important topic in the early days of B2C2B is pricing. Almost no founder we [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=932.6400000000001s)]
*  spoke with thought they perfected pricing. There are a variety of models, but really you're balancing [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=940.6400000000001s)]
*  two trade-offs, the budgets you go after and the pricing structure you offer. On budgets, you can [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=946.4s)]
*  simply do a cash pay model where you have end consumers pay, or you can allow for reimbursement [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  where the insurer, the employer, and so forth covers part or all of it. Cash pay naturally has less [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=958.0s)]
*  friction for the buyer, but that also may limit you on how much you can charge overall. And you [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=964.0799999999999s)]
*  may run into confusion as different consumers have different expectations for who covers their [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=969.36s)]
*  digital health services. Even though some of our early marketing was Maven is cheaper than the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=974.48s)]
*  price of a copay, there was a lot of consumer confusion still around, wait, shouldn't my [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=979.84s)]
*  insurance pay for this? And when it became a more transactional, like I just need a prescription [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=984.24s)]
*  for something, then it was more straightforward because you were getting something physically. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  But when it was a service, it was harder to understand why your insurance wouldn't pay for [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=994.72s)]
*  it even if you hit people over the head with the logic of, but it's cheaper than what your [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1001.36s)]
*  insurance even has. If you choose a cash pay model for the end user, how do you set the right price? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1006.72s)]
*  Here's how Butterfly did it for their point of care ultrasound device. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1012.64s)]
*  The view first of all is it had to be very affordable. It had to be at a price point where [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1016.4s)]
*  clinicians would just put in their credit card and then also could be afforded by many parts of the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1020.32s)]
*  world. And so the Jonathan, our founder, really just decided $2,000 is the price and made everyone [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1026.16s)]
*  else figure out how to get there. And I think it was the gut feeling that $2,000 was that right [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1034.96s)]
*  price point, right? That again, they could get the consumer, in this case a clinician to put in their [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1039.3600000000001s)]
*  credit card. The second trade off is around how you structure your pricing, i.e. whether you price [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1045.28s)]
*  usage or in a bundled offer. If you do usage based pricing, that might seem more fair. You pay for [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1050.5600000000002s)]
*  what you use, but you may discourage usage and most importantly, the user feedback that is [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1056.8000000000002s)]
*  incredibly informative to your early product development. Alternatively, you can structure [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1062.5600000000002s)]
*  your pricing in a subscription such as a monthly fee that may allow for a more natural usage pattern [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1067.2800000000002s)]
*  and customers can choose as much as they want for a fixed fee, but it does add more friction for the [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1073.2s)]
*  initial purchase. Ultimately in B2C, your pricing for engagement more than revenue, but as we heard [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1078.48s)]
*  from Amanda at Bold, which develops fitness programs for seniors aging in place, what you do [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1084.8000000000002s)]
*  in B2C has implications for your B2B pricing. We were actually less fixated candidly on the B2C [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1090.16s)]
*  pricing strategy. It was what is the potential ROI story that we can tell on the B2B side? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1098.8000000000002s)]
*  Then on B2C, we really privileged engagement. We did pricing experiments and that was great, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1105.28s)]
*  but I would say be mindful of whatever you put out as your B2C pricing because [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1111.1999999999998s)]
*  you will have to explain the difference between B2C and B2C2B. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1116.6399999999999s)]
*  When it comes to B2B pricing, we heard from founders that most business buyers preferred [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1121.6799999999998s)]
*  simplicity, but that really it was a matter of aligning incentives with the business you were [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1126.4799999999998s)]
*  actually selling into. For instance, payers are used to a per member per month, so that tends to [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1131.52s)]
*  be their preference, while most employers would rather have the simplicity of an annual license. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1136.8s)]
*  But stepping all the way back from pricing, the bigger question is when should you flip the switch [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1142.08s)]
*  and go B2B? We generally recommend turning on enterprise when you see repeatable usage patterns [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1147.76s)]
*  among a core customer group through concrete data gathering. Several digital health founders have [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1153.6s)]
*  told us that their enterprise buyers basically expected them to have a randomized controlled [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1158.96s)]
*  trial demonstrating the ROI before signing the partnership. We launched our research study at [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1163.68s)]
*  the same time that we launched our sort of D2C offering and the moment that we had our six month [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1170.8s)]
*  outcomes and we looked at what those six month outcomes were as far as reduction in annualized [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1178.08s)]
*  fall rates and improvement in balance and strength and mobility. That was for me the moment that I [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1184.56s)]
*  felt really excited and confident to take that story and that offering to enterprise customers. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1190.8s)]
*  I think that for us was did we feel like we were sufficiently de-risked in the eyes of someone who [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1198.6399999999999s)]
*  would be excited to be innovative but wants to know this isn't a total sort of shot in the dark, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1205.44s)]
*  like what is the guarantee? And so those, you know, the hard data from that research study also [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1212.3200000000002s)]
*  allowed us to think about like what is the ROI and over what time period and all that was very [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1218.72s)]
*  exciting for us. I think another way to do it and I get this question a lot is like the volume [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1224.5600000000002s)]
*  question. So maybe you haven't done a research study but you have really really big volume and [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1229.8400000000001s)]
*  you can start collecting that data or you can start saying like I just have already have this [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1235.44s)]
*  existing base of many many individuals. I think that's another way to position and share impact [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1240.64s)]
*  when you're having b2b conversations. Once you do go b2b you have a head start from the b2c motion [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1248.64s)]
*  but you still have to figure out how your end consumer connects with the business buyer [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1255.2800000000002s)]
*  and Benchling they followed their academic users into life sciences companies. And so you have these [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1259.44s)]
*  brand new companies oftentimes being spun out of academic labs that use Benchling that were doing [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1264.96s)]
*  breathtaking things, you know, gene editing medicines, lab-grown meats, you name it. And so [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1271.2s)]
*  some of the scientists who use Benchling for free in school started to go over there and then we [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1276.64s)]
*  were just kind of followed them and followed the user. And actually though at first like we really [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1281.1200000000001s)]
*  like struck out trying to sell anything to these companies like scientists had used Benchling in [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1285.5200000000002s)]
*  school, they liked it but they weren't going to buy it. The business like value wasn't there and [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1289.2800000000002s)]
*  that's when Benchling really started to grow. It went from kind of productivity suite for end users [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1294.64s)]
*  to building this single source of truth for the business and the end user experience that was what [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1299.44s)]
*  enabled us to get the data to then present back to the business like here's your scientific data in [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  one place, highly organized and structured. For Benchling reaching an enterprise buyer meant [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1309.28s)]
*  evolving their product offering to meet the more complex needs of an enterprise organization. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1315.44s)]
*  Similarly, Butterfly overcame the resistance of hospitals to allow clinicians to use a third [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1320.8s)]
*  party device, even one they paid for themselves by creating additional enterprise features. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1326.4s)]
*  We knew their concerns around security and governance and integration and so we built a [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1331.92s)]
*  software package for that. And so that then created the right dynamic where we actually had a product [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1337.52s)]
*  to sell which had higher recurring SAS dollars attached to it. And so it was a win-win from [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1343.8400000000001s)]
*  that perspective. We could solve their problem, we could solve the clinician's problem of wanting [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1353.04s)]
*  to use it in the hospital and then we're driving increased subscription revenue and deepening our [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1356.24s)]
*  tentacles in terms of the integration into the organization and spanning across the organization [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1361.76s)]
*  to do more. So far we've heard that the timing of when you go B2B comes down to having the ROI [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1367.44s)]
*  business case and a sufficient volume of users and then you have to find your enterprise buyer [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1374.32s)]
*  and layer in the additional product features they care about. But once you are in front of that [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1380.0s)]
*  buyer, how do you actually sell? So one of the things I deeply believe in is that people and [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1384.96s)]
*  organizations buy with their heart and they rationalize with their brain. The storytelling [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1390.48s)]
*  about what this device can enable using it at scale and how it's integrated into care and to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1394.96s)]
*  care pathways is why people are buying it. You then just simply need to justify the ROI on the [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1399.52s)]
*  back end as to why that makes sense for an organization. Health systems have thin margins, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1407.12s)]
*  they can't be investing in things that don't have some sort of ROI or at least a breakeven. And so [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1412.9599999999998s)]
*  you have to create your price but the storytelling is much more important and then the price just has [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1420.4799999999998s)]
*  to be justifiable at the end of the day. Throughout the conversation with founders who successfully [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1426.7199999999998s)]
*  went B2C2B, we heard about the importance of never losing focus on the end user. Even when [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1431.92s)]
*  you are selling to enterprise, end user product engagement is your advantage. Here's Andrew Lay, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1437.92s)]
*  founder of Booey Health, explaining why even as a B2B company, user engagement is the most important [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1443.8400000000001s)]
*  metric. The fact that people use something, anything, is the most important kind of metric [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1449.76s)]
*  of success for the buyer. Which then leads me to that evolution back to the consumer. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1458.3999999999999s)]
*  Why would someone want to use something super useful to them? That's it. When you think about [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1468.24s)]
*  selling to the employer space, and I talk about this with the team, our head of people wasn't [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1476.56s)]
*  buying stuff for Booey, looking at a calculator and being like, how much money did I save on email [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1483.28s)]
*  this week because I bought Slack? They weren't saying how many times did I not have to [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1490.56s)]
*  keep an Excel sheet updated or get people to log on to Excel and how much time and effort that would [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1499.44s)]
*  take. But instead people logged on to Namely. They're not doing that kind of calculus. They're [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1506.32s)]
*  looking at how many people are using Namely, Slack, Insert, Service, Benefit, Product, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1511.76s)]
*  whatever it may be. For us, that kind of reason circles back around to the consumer. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1518.8s)]
*  We should just care about being super, super, super useful to the consumer, to the end user. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1525.92s)]
*  That's all that matters. Playing with the numbers or playing with different ways of measuring ROI [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1530.8s)]
*  is in and of itself a good hearing. Once you've gone to the enterprise, a company is effectively [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1537.6s)]
*  executing two go-to-market motions at once. It can almost create this schizophrenic pressure. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1543.36s)]
*  How do companies in the later stages balance the needs of the consumer with the needs of the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1549.28s)]
*  enterprise? Like Andrew at Booey, for Amanda at Bold, it's about always coming back to the end user. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1554.32s)]
*  There's absolutely considerations. Are you integrating with Epic? Can you collect this [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1560.32s)]
*  additional information that we're going to need to verify that they're eligible through their [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1565.68s)]
*  health plan? Honestly, when we add those pieces in, I think about we establish the best practice. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1569.92s)]
*  Then we start to see how implementation can actually pull us away from what we believe our [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1577.2s)]
*  high bar standard should be. Then it's just we rally the team to say, okay, how do we [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1582.88s)]
*  take off the needs that our enterprise customer requires? We absolutely will do that. But then [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1588.8s)]
*  pull ourselves back up so that we aren't allowing the default to be this perhaps lower engagement, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1594.56s)]
*  higher friction experience and incrementally improve. I think that has been really helpful [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1603.9199999999998s)]
*  for our product team as far as understanding there's going to be some deviations. We have to [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1609.84s)]
*  keep experimenting, but just I think really being open with the team around we know what's possible. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1613.6799999999998s)]
*  Let's get back to that maximally engaging experience. Now, while focus on the end user is [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1620.72s)]
*  important, you always have to manage enterprise expectations. Otherwise, your product team can [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1626.8000000000002s)]
*  end up pulled into too many directions. It's the age-old problem of going into the enterprise, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1632.16s)]
*  right? Because it's this you're talking to a leader of a really important health system that could be [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1637.44s)]
*  your first reference account and they're demanding some feature capability. It's easy to [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1642.5600000000002s)]
*  make the mistake of over promising. And so what I've learned on the commercial side is, A, tell your [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1650.88s)]
*  product and engineering people to be conservative. Start there, right? Whatever they give you to be [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1659.68s)]
*  conservative, add a quarter to it. Once you've sold into the enterprise and are now managing two [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1665.52s)]
*  go-to-market motions in parallel, professional services can play an integral role in making [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1671.44s)]
*  these more complex customers successful using your product. Big organizations need help. They're [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1676.8s)]
*  so large that they need extra support to make changes. And who better to know how to implement [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1683.28s)]
*  your product than you? And those are your people who know your product and they're going to bring [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1688.32s)]
*  back that knowledge to your R&D teams and help make the product better. And so I think adding [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1692.56s)]
*  professional services was an incredibly important business decision for us. Now, you need to make [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1701.04s)]
*  sure that you're not using professional services as a bandaid to cover for bad product or to avoid [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1705.04s)]
*  building product in certain areas or to have to customize the software. A big part of the [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1709.84s)]
*  whole thesis of spine benching was that we could build something that was highly configurable. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1715.2s)]
*  So it could be applied to different scientific use cases, but didn't require a bunch of programming [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1718.72s)]
*  for every different customers stuck in some customization hell. And so we heavily employ [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1722.32s)]
*  services. We sell services with every deal we do. It doesn't matter if you're a tiny startup, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1729.6s)]
*  it's like a very fixed quick start package kind of thing, a couple hours. And if you're a giant [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1734.56s)]
*  enterprise moving everyone to benching, we may be doing services with you for 18 months across [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1739.6799999999998s)]
*  2000 people in 20 sites. But I think the customers, the enterprise ones especially, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1744.72s)]
*  they want to know that not only are they buying the software, but they are like services are a [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1749.52s)]
*  guarantee that they're going to be successful with the software. Okay. So we've heard from [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1754.96s)]
*  founders about the journey from the early days of engaging your first users to balancing two [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1759.12s)]
*  motions at scale. And perhaps most exciting in all of this is that B2C2B keeps those who build [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1764.48s)]
*  digital health products close to the end users who need them. At A16Z, we are incredibly excited [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1770.96s)]
*  about the potential of this approach to improve healthcare and at lower costs. And I'll pass it [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1777.3600000000001s)]
*  back now to Julie, who will share our perspective on what our team pays most attention to as [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1782.64s)]
*  investors. And so we wanted to just share a few things about what we would look for in evaluating [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1787.52s)]
*  investment opportunities. And there's really, I would say three major pillars to that. One would [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1792.96s)]
*  be focused on the C part of the motion. So, you know, really at the earliest stages looking for [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1796.48s)]
*  B2C traction. And it largely looks like the way that you would evaluate any B2C business. So you'll [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1802.16s)]
*  look at the cohorts, you'll look at adoption, retention, stickiness, you look at marketing [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1808.4s)]
*  efficiency, your TAC or customer acquisition costs versus your projected LTV. And, you know, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1812.4s)]
*  this is really where, you know, compared to a B2B2C motion or even just a straight B2B motion, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1818.48s)]
*  you would really just expect to see far more user data and validation earlier in the trajectory of [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1824.16s)]
*  the business than you would otherwise see. And then the other thing to point out on the C side is [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1828.96s)]
*  really, I would say product velocities. One of the benefits, as we mentioned earlier, of doing the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1833.68s)]
*  B2C motion to begin with is the ability to have much higher speed of iteration on your actual [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1838.4s)]
*  product. And so that is certainly something that we would qualitatively look at as well. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1846.32s)]
*  So that's pillar one. Pillar two would really be around the B. And that's where, you know, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1851.36s)]
*  when you're looking at a seed or even a series A stage company, there might be less quantitative [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1855.9199999999998s)]
*  data to look at on this front. And so, you know, here we'll look for just the early validation. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1860.32s)]
*  How many cycles have you spent on the enterprise side? Do you actually have a pipeline of enterprise [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1865.76s)]
*  logos and an ability to really tell that enterprise story in a reasonably compelling [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1870.3999999999999s)]
*  and articulate way? Certainly bonus points if you actually have a contract with an enterprise buyer [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1875.84s)]
*  and or have actually gone live with an enterprise. And then the final pillar that we generally look [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1882.0s)]
*  for is, you know, does your financing plan and your actual company build plan appropriately [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1886.56s)]
*  accommodate the fact that you will be investing in essentially two motions in parallel? As we [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1892.48s)]
*  mentioned before, you know, B2C to B sounds all great, but, you know, it actually is quite a bit [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1897.28s)]
*  of work to build a consumer muscle at the same time as building that enterprise muscle. And so [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1902.0s)]
*  we just want to make sure that founders fully appreciate that. So in closing, thank you first [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1907.04s)]
*  of all for joining us for this first of a series of Digital Health Go-to-Market Playbooks. If you [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1911.6s)]
*  happen to be a digital health builder yourself who is thinking about or actually executing on any of [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1916.8s)]
*  these go-to-market strategies, we would love to hear from you. So please do reach out with your [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGum0TPJpbw&t=1921.76s)]
