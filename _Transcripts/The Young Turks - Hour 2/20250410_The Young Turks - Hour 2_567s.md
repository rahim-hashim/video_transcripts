# BREAKING: SCOTUS Rules Trump Admin MUST 'Facilitate' Deported Migrant To U.S.
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg)
*  Breaking right now, the Supreme Court has just ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=0.0s)]
*  the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He's the man who the Trump administration has [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=4.96s)]
*  admitted they mistakenly deported to the Terrorism Confinement Center, aka the infamous prison [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=9.76s)]
*  in El Salvador. But we need to be clear, the Supreme Court is not requiring the return of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=15.52s)]
*  Abrego Garcia. They are saying they have to do it, but they're not requiring it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=22.0s)]
*  Here's what we mean. In an unsigned order, the court endorsed part of a trial judge's order [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=27.6s)]
*  that required the government to quote, facilitate and effectuate the return of the migrant, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. The Supreme Court's order, which was unsigned with no noted [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=37.52s)]
*  dissents read as follows. The order properly requires the government to facilitate Abrego [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=42.64s)]
*  Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador. The intended scope of the term [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=53.12s)]
*  effectuate in the district court's order is however unclear and may exceed the district [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=58.0s)]
*  court's authority. Quote, the district court should clarify its directive with due regard [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs. For its part, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=67.92s)]
*  the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps that it's taken [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=72.56s)]
*  and the prospect of further steps. The court's three liberal justices also criticized the Trump [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=76.08s)]
*  administration writing, the government's argument implies that it could deport and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=81.6s)]
*  incarcerate any person including US citizens without legal consequence. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  So long as it does so before a court can intervene, that's from Sotomayor and the other [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=88.88s)]
*  liberal justices. Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court Analyst and Professor at Georgetown [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=94.72s)]
*  University Law Center stated, although the ruling makes clear the district court order [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=100.0s)]
*  can order the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the US, it is maddeningly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=104.0s)]
*  vague about exactly how it's supposed to do so. For instance, if the judge asks the government [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=109.2s)]
*  about the specific arrangements it's made with the Salvadoran government and the government evokes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=114.8s)]
*  the state secrets privilege, what happens then? It is yet again punting in a context in which [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=119.28s)]
*  the government can take advantage of the punt. A loss for Trump on the big question, but a loss [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  for Abrego Garcia on what matters most, him coming back here to America, coming back home. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=127.76s)]
*  And so they are saying, bring them home. They're not saying how or they have to, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  and it's unconscionable and it's ridiculous because the Trump administration obviously can [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  just say to El Salvador, we made a mistake. We're sending a plane, bring this man back. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=145.52s)]
*  And they would of course do it. Why would they want to pick a fight with the US who [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=151.04s)]
*  we have this new relationship with for bringing money into their country to house the people who [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=155.6s)]
*  are being removed, who are not US citizens. And of course they would send him right back. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=161.68s)]
*  And so it's yet again like an unforced error or quite intentional from the Trump administration [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  just to scare a lot of people who are not white, but are living in this country that you're on [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  watch, you're on notice, live on edge, who might throw you out of the country at any moment. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=176.8s)]
*  It's really crazy and despicable. Cenk? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=180.32s)]
*  Yeah, this is one of the great part of the Supreme Court decision that I want to get [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  to in a second and then the absurdity of this case. But first, I want to be clear. So they're [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=186.64s)]
*  saying that they're requiring the government. So the Supreme Court is clear in that they've [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  ruled for this person to be returned and they're requiring it of the government. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=200.48s)]
*  But I think they don't know what it means to quote unquote facilitate and effectuate the return. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  And in fact, it's not that I think that they are saying it. They're saying it's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  bringing it back to the district court for them to explain under what authority we're bringing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=217.12s)]
*  them back. But they also said the government must explain what are the different options [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=222.08s)]
*  for bringing him back. So they can't just go out, we don't want to do it, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  So I think that that whole thing about bringing it back to the district court and figure out how to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=231.12s)]
*  hell to get him back is partly real, right? Because I don't know that we've ever had a situation like [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=236.0s)]
*  this where we've had shipped someone to a foreign dungeon and then said oops, it's the wrong guy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=241.28s)]
*  So now how do we get him back? Well, Ben's absolutely right. In practice, you just say it [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=248.08s)]
*  and then give it back to you. It's not like the dictator in El Salvador is gonna say no to Trump. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=254.48s)]
*  If Trump asked for the guy back, he'll be on the back on the first plane. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=260.96s)]
*  But how do you effectuate that within the law? I don't, nobody's probably written a law for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=264.4s)]
*  how to get someone back from a dungeon, because we've never sent someone to a foreign dungeon [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  before, at least not legally. But overall, I don't want you to worry about that too much. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=273.68s)]
*  This is the Supreme Court saying no, you must bring him back. And now the second great part [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  of their ruling is no dissent. So they're already bringing it back to the district court and making [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=287.68s)]
*  the district court try to figure out how in the world to effectuate this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=294.96s)]
*  So maybe that's their concession to the Clarence Thomas's and the Alito's, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=298.64s)]
*  etc. of the world. But no dissent at all saying no, that he must be brought back. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=302.4s)]
*  They are requiring the government to do that. So when this very, very conservative Supreme Court [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=308.64s)]
*  says nine to nothing, no, you can't just send innocent people to a prison in a different country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=315.44s)]
*  That's the court's holding and actually checking Donald Trump and bringing him back to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=323.68s)]
*  the US Constitution, the US rules. And if you don't know this, the absurd parts of the case, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=330.96s)]
*  do you know the only evidence that they presented against this guy was that he was wearing a bull's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=336.08s)]
*  hat and bull's hoodie as in Chicago Bulls. And they thought that was some sort of gang sign. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=341.36s)]
*  So half of Chicago, watch out, okay? This is totally crazy. I mean, what they did to this [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  guy and what they're doing overall is just nuts. And the last part of how nuts it is, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=354.16s)]
*  is in court at the district court level, they were arguing, yeah, no, we're wrong. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=361.6s)]
*  We got the wrong guy, we admit that. And no, we don't wanna bring him back. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=365.68s)]
*  What do you mean you don't wanna bring him back? I mean, Ben, that's just the craziest thing I've [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=370.88s)]
*  ever heard. 100%, and on that standard, by the way, it's about time we kick Dennis Rodman [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=374.96s)]
*  out of this country because he wears bulls paraphernalia and doesn't look like he's from [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=380.32s)]
*  here and by from here, I mean this planet. But it's 100% the design of the Trump administration [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=384.0s)]
*  because you wonder why it's these unforced errors, why they do these things that could easily be [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  corrected. It's because they very specifically don't wanna do that. If they indeed only wanted [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=394.88s)]
*  to remove people who were here under actual violation of our law, who were actually criminals, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=401.2s)]
*  then you would be very eager to immediately apologize. You wouldn't make the mistake, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=409.28s)]
*  probably in the first place, but if you did, you'd be very eager to apologize and correct [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=414.24s)]
*  the record and say that is the kind of thing we don't tolerate. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=418.88s)]
*  But it's the exact reason that whether or not Elon Musk's Nazi salute was intentional or not, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=421.84s)]
*  it's the exact reason why he didn't overtly and immediately apologize for the interpretation [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=428.88s)]
*  of it being that and why Trump didn't say anything apologizing for it and saying his [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=433.76s)]
*  administration won't ever stand for something like that. Not because they're necessarily explicitly [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=439.6s)]
*  Nazis or because they explicitly want to be associated with that ideology. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=444.96s)]
*  But what they do want is the empowerment of anybody who can join their ranks of people who [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=449.84s)]
*  can stand up and create rebellions, create attempted coups in the future, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=455.76s)]
*  can create any sort of action they want against the normal order and the normal values of the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=459.68s)]
*  American government and the American society. They have all of these rogue people that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=465.52s)]
*  are white supremacists, generally speaking, and love to these little winks, these little dog [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=470.08s)]
*  whistles that say we're actually on your side. Look, we're not asking for the American guy back [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  because he's not descended from here. We're not asking, we're not apologizing for a Nazi [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  salute because we know you guys think this is empowering of white supremacy and we're not [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=484.96s)]
*  saying no, it's not. Not no on that and that's really, really scary. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=491.52s)]
*  Yeah, so last quick thing on this is that look, if you're in the right wing, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  you got triggered by some of the words that Ben just used. Well, look, Democrats said that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=499.76s)]
*  Trump would be authoritarian and I said that and I got no love for the establishment, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=504.88s)]
*  etc. But I voted against Trump because I was worried he was gonna be authoritarian. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=510.0s)]
*  Does it get any more authoritarian than we sent an innocent man to one of the worst prisons in [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=513.84s)]
*  the world in a different country? And we know we're wrong, we know he's innocent, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPghmulChg&t=520.72s)]
