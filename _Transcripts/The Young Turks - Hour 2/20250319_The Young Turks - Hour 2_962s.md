# Tesla Vandalism: Elon Musk Says It's Terrorism
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I)
*  This dramatic video showing multiple cars in flames. According to authorities, the suspected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=0.0s)]
*  arson occurred early this morning. When police arrived, they found five vehicles set on fire [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=6.76s)]
*  or damaged and the word resist spray painted on the front of the business. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=11.48s)]
*  So when they do it to a Tesla dealership, it's really bad. But when they do it to the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=15.64s)]
*  halls of Congress, we should pardon them. Is that your position? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=20.36s)]
*  No, I've never. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=24.36s)]
*  Are we okay with the dealership partners? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=25.36s)]
*  I know you haven't been around for a while, so let me educate you about my position about [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=27.68s)]
*  January the 6th. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=30.6s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=31.6s)]
*  Let me educate you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=32.6s)]
*  You don't need to be condescending to me. So let me educate you about my position. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=33.6s)]
*  Tonight, Musk will be posting the video from Las Vegas calling the incident terrorism. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=39.12s)]
*  I gotta say, Scott Jennings usually keeps it cool during these CNN debates, but he really [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=43.6s)]
*  lost his temper during this debate about the Tesla dealerships that have been targeted [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=51.8s)]
*  by individuals and often in a lot of cases in some pretty violent, terrifying ways. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=57.68s)]
*  And we're gonna get back to that brawl that almost took place on CNN in just a minute. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=64.08s)]
*  But the FBI is investigating attacks on multiple Tesla dealerships across the country, some [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=70.16s)]
*  of which again have been targeted in violent ways. Now, luckily, there haven't been any [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=75.24s)]
*  injuries reported. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=80.56s)]
*  And John, I gotta be honest, it's actually a minor miracle that there haven't been any [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=81.84s)]
*  injuries reported because there are instances of people literally shooting into these Tesla [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=85.26s)]
*  dealerships which could hurt someone or kill someone. So look, I understand the fury that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=90.72s)]
*  people are feeling toward Elon Musk. Please don't do this because you're gonna harm someone. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  You're gonna hurt innocent people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=102.2s)]
*  This isn't the right way to get your message across. And if anything, if you get caught, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  you're gonna suffer some very serious consequences. And I don't see how that's going to change [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  anything in our political system. But what do you think, John? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=113.2s)]
*  Yeah, not anything positive necessarily. At this point, probably likely to end up in some [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=116.64s)]
*  sort of South American super prison or something like that. So I'd be careful about that. I [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  do think though, there's a lot of people assuming that the violence we're seeing is being perpetrated [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=129.68s)]
*  by critics of Elon Musk. It could be that they're enthusiasts of him. I mean, he has [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=134.64s)]
*  encouraged people to use flamethrowers for entertainment. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  And he has repeatedly said that cyber trucks are bulletproof, although in many cases they [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  are not. And so it's possible that they're just taking him up on these bits of hype that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  he's done. But anyway, yeah, look, blowing up some Teslas or whatever is not gonna tank [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=154.44s)]
*  Tesla, if anything, it's gonna be the continued leadership of Elon Musk that does that. It [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=160.92s)]
*  hurts the local dealership and potentially maybe physically hurts the employees there [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=165.84s)]
*  who are not Elon Musk and might despise Elon Musk as much as you do. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  But that said, all that, don't crime. The fact that they have so quickly and universally [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=176.92s)]
*  landed on destroying some of the private property of a wealthy person is literal terrorism. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that that's bad. I think setting a Tesla on fire is bad. I think it's worse to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  label anything bad happening to a business concern of a dude in your administration now [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=197.98s)]
*  being terrorism. I think that that's, I think more worrisome. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=203.78s)]
*  So I initially shared the same idea, the same thoughts, but let me go through some [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=208.34s)]
*  of these details and then we'll revisit what we actually think about this. Because if it's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=215.46s)]
*  merely someone spray painted, resist on a door of a Tesla dealership and nothing more, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=220.9s)]
*  then yeah, obviously I agree that's not terrorism. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=226.5s)]
*  But some of these acts, I think do qualify if they are motivated by politics, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=229.86s)]
*  There's a political message that's being sent here because of who Elon Musk is, because [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=237.84s)]
*  of his closeness to the Trump administration. So these incidents do keep happening across [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  the country. For instance, four cyber trucks were set on fire at a Tesla lot in Seattle [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=246.76s)]
*  earlier this month. Last week on Friday, a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=251.62s)]
*  Model S and set it on fire. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=258.0s)]
*  But get a load of this, in a Portland suburb, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=260.48s)]
*  Tesla showroom last week. That's crazy. That's crazy. All of it. Yes, all of it is. I'm not [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  justifying any of this, but I think the terrorism threat or the terrorism claim could apply [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=274.5s)]
*  to some of these instances. This was actually the second time in a week that that same Tesla [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=280.66s)]
*  dealership was targeted. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=285.98s)]
*  Now, let's get to the latest attack. This one was at a Tesla dealership in Las Vegas. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=287.38s)]
*  He said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails, crude bombs filled with gasoline or [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=293.14000000000004s)]
*  other flammable liquid, and also fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=298.94s)]
*  So here's more on that from NBC News. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=305.62s)]
*  We believe the suspect approached the business wearing all black clothing, and he used what [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=309.14000000000004s)]
*  appear to be Molotov cocktails and a firearm to conduct his attack. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=313.58000000000004s)]
*  Just hours before in Kansas City, two Tesla cyber trucks set ablaze at a dealership there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=317.42s)]
*  Tonight, the FBI stepping in to help local police investigate both incidents. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=322.7s)]
*  To those who might think that something like this is justifiable or potentially even admirable. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=326.86s)]
*  We want to let you know it's a federal crime. We will come after you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=332.94s)]
*  While authorities say the identities of the suspects and the motivation behind the attacks [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=336.58s)]
*  are still unknown, it comes amid at least 16 reports of vandalism to Tesla vehicles [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=340.53999999999996s)]
*  and dealerships across the country. As people nationwide protest Tesla CEO Elon Musk and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=345.18s)]
*  this prominent role in the Trump administration. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=350.62s)]
*  We're out here because we're defending democracy. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=352.97999999999996s)]
*  So I want to differentiate between peaceful gentlemen like the one you just heard from [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=357.06s)]
*  at the very end of that video. All they're doing is they're protesting right outside of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=361.3s)]
*  the dealerships. They're not harming anyone. They're not fire bombing the dealerships. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=365.3s)]
*  The individuals who are doing that though, are either getting arrested and I'll give you some [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=370.18s)]
*  specific instances of people who have been arrested or the FBI is investigating to find [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=375.38s)]
*  the perpetrators to bring them to justice. But there have been violent individuals. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=380.34s)]
*  They are separate from the peaceful protesters like the older gentleman you heard from again, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=385.61999999999995s)]
*  at the end of that video. So yeah, look, I just then there are the individual Tesla owners who [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=390.26s)]
*  are having their cars absolutely destroyed because they have a Tesla. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=399.7s)]
*  And that's even worse, I think. Come on man. Don't target individual people. Don't do any of this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=404.74s)]
*  This is bad. This is not good. You're not winning anything. You're not gonna change anything by [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=412.74s)]
*  doing this. But ordinary random people, they might not even be paying attention to politics. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=416.9s)]
*  They might have bought that Tesla a year ago, years ago. Who knows? Don't victimize them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=424.34s)]
*  It's just gross. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, Elon Musk has like a 34% approval rating. Just by the numbers, they probably don't like him. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=430.9s)]
*  Lots of them are putting the bumper sticker, like I bought this before he turned into an a-hole or [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=436.73999999999995s)]
*  whatever to indicate it. But don't do that. It's shooting at a building. There could be [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=441.38s)]
*  people working in there. There could be nighttime maintenance or cleaning crew or something. It's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=446.97999999999996s)]
*  crazy. Fire bomb. It's counterproductive anyway. It's a Tesla. There was a good chance it was gonna [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=451.62s)]
*  burst into flame anyway. Why do you have to get it started? And the only thing though, again, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=458.58s)]
*  about the terrorism is I would feel a little bit less concerned about their rush to declare anything [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=464.5s)]
*  like this as terrorism. If first of all, we hadn't seen everything else going on this administration, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=473.21999999999997s)]
*  all the authorities and everything. But when people were shooting up [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=477.62s)]
*  Democratic campaign offices in the last election, silence, utter silence. Obviously January 6, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=482.18s)]
*  I think is another great example. Silence, like when Nancy Pelosi's husband's skull is cracked [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=489.38s)]
*  open and they think it's the funniest thing that has ever happened. That's not hypothetically [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=494.98s)]
*  somebody can get hurt. They laughed after someone got hurt. That's not terrorism? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=500.26s)]
*  Okay, so first of all, obviously we condemn those folks because they are easy to condemn. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=505.94s)]
*  It's awful to cheer on violence of any kind. But look, that actually kind of takes me back to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=512.02s)]
*  the fight that happened on that CNN panel, right? Because it doesn't have to be, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=518.58s)]
*  what about that though? No, how about both things are bad? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=525.46s)]
*  How about- Yeah, in my defense, I already said that this stuff was bad. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=528.82s)]
*  No, no, I know. I'm mostly referring to like Neera Tanden, who's like, oh yeah, well, what about [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=532.4200000000001s)]
*  the January 6 protesters? Without even knowing where Scott Jennings fell on that issue, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=539.14s)]
*  And to be fair, I didn't know either. But if I'm gonna make that allegation against Scott Jennings, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=545.7800000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna do a little research beforehand, knowing that this is gonna be the topic we discuss, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=550.26s)]
*  to ensure that he actually wanted the pardons for all those January 6 rioters. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=554.98s)]
*  So with that in mind, why don't we actually skip ahead to that video? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=561.62s)]
*  Let's see the full context of this fight between Scott Jennings and Neera Tanden. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=566.02s)]
*  That's the American left right now. It is one angry mob after another, willing to take things [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=570.82s)]
*  into their own hands up to and including keying, firebombing, and otherwise vandalizing [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=577.5400000000001s)]
*  cars and car dealerships and charging stations. It's outrageous. It is terrorism. People ought [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=582.74s)]
*  to be put in jail and left there for a very long time and be taught a lesson. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=588.5s)]
*  So when they do it to a Tesla dealership, it's really bad. But when they do it to the halls of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=592.34s)]
*  Congress, we should pardon them. Is that your position? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=597.86s)]
*  No, I don't support it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=600.98s)]
*  Are we okay with the January 6 pardons? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=602.34s)]
*  I know you haven't been around for a while, so let me educate you about my position about January 6. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=604.5s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=608.1800000000001s)]
*  Let me educate you. No, no, no. You don't need to be condescending to me. So let me educate you [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=608.98s)]
*  about my position. You wanna attack me? Let me finish it. Let me finish it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=615.14s)]
*  Let's do this January 6 and then Neera. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=619.62s)]
*  I'm sorry you're getting emotional. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=621.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry you're a condescending person who hasn't been paying attention to what I do. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=622.82s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  So here's the issue. I didn't support what happened on January the 6th and was one of [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=626.82s)]
*  the first Republicans to call it out. I don't support the pardons. I have repeatedly, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=630.58s)]
*  just like my friend Ashley here, said that no violence in our political system is acceptable. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=634.74s)]
*  Thank you. I think that's the right take to have. And look, I really don't like Neera Tanden, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=642.74s)]
*  so I don't really mind her getting slapped out in that segment. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=647.22s)]
*  You should do your research before you accuse someone of anything. But the right take here, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=650.0200000000001s)]
*  guys, is to speak out against violent acts. And for those who are shooting guns into Tesla [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=653.78s)]
*  dealerships, yeah, they are terrorizing people who work there, right? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=660.42s)]
*  Those people have no say in what's happening in the federal government right now. They have no [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=664.8199999999999s)]
*  control over Elon Musk. And to victimize them and threaten their safety like this does not make you [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=669.22s)]
*  a winner, politically speaking. If anything, it turns people against you or against the message [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=676.02s)]
*  that these people are trying to send in pushing back against Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=682.18s)]
*  And look, again, I want to reiterate, obviously, there are people who are infuriated with what's [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=687.62s)]
*  happening in the federal government right now, the dismantling of certain institutions and federal [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=692.5s)]
*  government agencies. But we have to have a better strategy to respond to it and to effectively beat [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=697.78s)]
*  Republicans as opposed to helping them in their messaging, right? Because what are they doing now? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=706.26s)]
*  Scott Jennings, the one thing I'll say about him is, no, this isn't the left, okay? The left doesn't [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=712.1s)]
*  in general support what's happening with these violent acts, with the fire bombings, with the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=718.1s)]
*  shooting into Tesla dealerships. So don't make those generalizations because it's gross. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=725.0600000000001s)]
*  There are plenty of people on the left who have been speaking out against this, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=729.62s)]
*  myself included, obviously John as well. And so I want to just quickly go through some of the people [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=732.98s)]
*  who have been prosecuted and arrested so far. So some people luckily have been arrested. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=738.02s)]
*  Prosecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=742.5799999999999s)]
*  dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words Nazi cars spray painted [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=746.8199999999999s)]
*  on the building. Federal agents in South Carolina last week also arrested a man that had set fire, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=753.06s)]
*  or they say had set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=759.62s)]
*  An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=764.5s)]
*  that authorities found writings critical of the government and Doge in his bedroom and wallet. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=771.3s)]
*  That statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs, the agent wrote. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=778.3399999999999s)]
*  And also an Oregon man faces charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=784.02s)]
*  at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=790.1s)]
*  One final thing that I'll say about this is, look, this is what happens when ordinary Americans [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=796.1800000000001s)]
*  feel like they have no representation or no way of fighting back through our political system. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=804.66s)]
*  And that's really a failure of the Democratic Party to be honest with you. They don't feel [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=811.14s)]
*  the Democrats are fighting on their behalf, so they're taking matters into their own hands. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=814.5s)]
*  I don't think that is a smart thing to do. I don't agree with what they're doing. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=818.26s)]
*  But it does seem to be what happens in situations where there's this void in leadership. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=822.34s)]
*  If you want to talk about impotent leadership, the Democratic Party has covered their bases. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=829.54s)]
*  Any final words on this, John? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=834.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that's definitely true. And I think that's why we're seeing so much [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=835.3s)]
*  rage at like Chuck Schumer and that and all the enthusiasm for Bernie's tour and everything. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=838.42s)]
*  But I also think one reason we might be seeing even more of like a freak out early on in a new [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=842.5s)]
*  administration than we usually do is like the way that our system is supposed to work is the idea [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=847.06s)]
*  that you give it your best in the election. And if you fail in four years, you get to try again. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=852.5s)]
*  And maybe they win this time and then we win next time. And that's suffered a lot of blows recently, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=857.78s)]
*  like the rights unwillingness to accept defeat in 2020, the mainstreaming of the big lie, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=862.9s)]
*  I think has scared a lot of people. But then also the way that Trump has governed, Trump and Musk, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=869.06s)]
*  cuz I think Musk is responsible for a lot of this. Like their like absolutist [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=874.5s)]
*  like way of governing makes people afraid that, wait, maybe we don't just get to win in four years. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=880.58s)]
*  I'm not even talking about like, we won't have elections. I'm saying [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=886.74s)]
*  what government will be left after four years if they shut down everything? Like the Democrats [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=890.18s)]
*  don't govern this way. Like when the Republicans win after four years of a Democrat, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=896.26s)]
*  they can change the course of the government, but the government's still there. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=901.38s)]
*  They haven't shut down Social Security and Medicare and there's no Department of Education. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=905.06s)]
*  And like when you do all of that so quickly, it scares people into thinking, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=908.82s)]
*  maybe there is no coming back from this. I think that that's a dangerous message to send. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=914.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I definitely think people are under that impression and they're lashing out as a [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=918.66s)]
*  result of that. But again, I think this is like providing the GOP and allies of Musk and Donald [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=924.58s)]
*  Trump, the fodder to essentially slap down the left, make blanket statements about the entirety [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=933.14s)]
*  of the left and it just isn't a winning strategy. So giving into emotional urges, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=938.9000000000001s)]
*  believe me, I understand that probably better than anyone. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=945.46s)]
*  But you have to take a beat, think about this intelligently and understand that this is more [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=948.58s)]
*  counterproductive than anything else. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHsW9ejxl1I&t=954.1s)]
