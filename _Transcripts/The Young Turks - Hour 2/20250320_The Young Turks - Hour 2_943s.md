# Trump's Approval Ratings Hit Historic Low
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE)
*  Trump's net job approval rating. Look, in January 2025, he was on the positive side of the ledger. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=0.0s)]
*  He was at plus seven points. Look now, he has come back down. He is underwater, right? He's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  doing a little bit of the breaststroke, maybe doing a little bit of the butterfly. He's at minus two [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=12.8s)]
*  points. And it's not just in one poll, it's multiple, CNN, Fox, Ipsos, NBC, and Quinnipiac [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=17.44s)]
*  University 999, the American folks are saying, oi vei, i caramba. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=23.84s)]
*  I just feel like Harry Enton's doctor needs to prescribe a lower dose of Adderall, okay? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=30.64s)]
*  Just a little bit lower. And I'm just kidding. I don't know if he's on Adderall, but he's always [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=37.44s)]
*  super energetic. And if it's not drug induced, can he bottle up whatever energy he has and hand [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=40.96s)]
*  it over to me? Anyway, according to CNN data analyst Harry Enton, Trump's approval ratings [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=47.92s)]
*  are starting to dip into the negatives. But what's really interesting is that Trump has just hit his [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=53.44s)]
*  historically low numbers. Well, how low? Well, let's go back to Harry Enton, a very energetic [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=59.84s)]
*  Harry Enton for more on that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=65.92s)]
*  Presidents with negative net approval ratings at this point of term since 1937. Well, there are two [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  men on the screen and they're the same two men, Trump in 2017 and Trump in 2025. He only matches [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=75.92s)]
*  himself. I guess the good news is he's doing a little bit better than he was eight years ago [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  at this point. But when you're only matching yourself and you're the only dude who's underwater [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=88.24s)]
*  at this point, not particularly good. Every single other president at this point in a term, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  either first or second was above water. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=96.8s)]
*  All right, so people are not liking what Trump has been up to. He was thought to be better on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=102.72s)]
*  the economy than the Democratic Party. And people were thinking about Trump's economy in his first [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=108.96s)]
*  term before COVID hit. But he's handling the economy very differently this time around. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=114.48s)]
*  And looks like people don't like it, boss. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  I don't think anyone should be surprised by this. He came in on a wave of people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=123.04s)]
*  being dissatisfied with prices and the economy. And dissatisfied with immigration policy, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=132.0s)]
*  whatever you might wanna say. And he's done absolutely nothing to assuage these worries. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=140.88s)]
*  There's definitely a honeymoon period where the American people, especially the people who voted [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=149.12s)]
*  for the guy, are going to be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. And that's what him and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  especially that press secretary of his have been like, Biden, Biden, Biden, Biden. We came in with [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  historic horribleness because of Joe Biden, blah, blah, blah. At a certain point, man, he's going to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=164.96s)]
*  have to wear these economic truths. And that's what I think is being reflected in his very low [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=170.48s)]
*  approval rating. And then the terrorists, as chaotic as they have been, all it's done is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=177.04s)]
*  fluctuate the stock market, which again makes it seem like everything is unstable. And he's not [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=182.48s)]
*  selling a plan. He's basically saying, trust us, I alone can fix this, which is not an explanation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=188.48s)]
*  And you guys, all of you guys, not Elon, not the rest of the rich people in the economy, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  all of you guys have to bear the brunt. All of you guys have to tighten your belts and nobody else. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=203.12s)]
*  That's not a winning message. People are going to reject that. People don't wanna hear that Elon [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=209.76s)]
*  needs to have a stock price propped up. The richest man in the world, but social security [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=217.12s)]
*  needs to be cut. That's what the messaging, we're killing you with tariffs. We're killing you with [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=223.6s)]
*  price hikes. We're cutting your social security. We're putting your Medicare on the chopping block. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=229.28s)]
*  This is just incoherent and nobody should be surprised that the American people aren't [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=235.44s)]
*  excited about this. Yeah, well, to be fair, they haven't said that they're going after Medicare. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=242.0s)]
*  And I actually think they're smart enough to keep their hands off that, but they are going [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=248.56s)]
*  after Medicaid and they're doing it in a slimy way where they think we're so stupid that we're [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=252.64s)]
*  not gonna notice that the House's blueprint called for the very House committee in charge [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  and responsible for Medicaid to find $880 billion in cuts. Okay, they're focused on cutting Medicaid. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=266.8s)]
*  Make no mistake about it. We're not stupid. We know about the negotiations that have happened [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  in the House. Now with that in mind, you mentioned was that voters aren't happy with [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=280.64s)]
*  the Trump economy. That is true unless you're talking about Republican voters. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=285.84s)]
*  So Trump has the largest gap of any president in the last 80 years between his approval rating [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  among members of his own party. 90% of them are loving what he's up to. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  And his approval rating from the opposing party, 4%. So that's Democrats. And that's according to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=300.96s)]
*  analysis of three decades of NBC News polling and earlier data from Gallup. Among independents, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=308.0s)]
*  only 30% approve and 67 disapprove of Trump's performance in office. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=314.32s)]
*  And yeah, independents, people like me, are the ones who at this point decide elections. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=319.76s)]
*  But I don't know, Trump doesn't really seem to care. As long as his core base is behind him, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=327.36s)]
*  he doesn't need to win reelection, right? He's not concerned about that. So I don't know if this is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=334.24s)]
*  gonna have any impact on his decision making. Now, when you break down that data, Trump has a negative [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=340.48s)]
*  approval rating on every major issue except one. Let's see what that issue is. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=346.24s)]
*  This is a big issue. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=351.12s)]
*  Trump's net approval rating on major issues, positive. Immigration, how about negative? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=354.16s)]
*  The economy, federal budget, foreign policy, health care, tariffs, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=359.52s)]
*  underwater on all of these issues. And that is what is dragging Donald Trump down. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=364.4s)]
*  Despite all of the stories in the news about terrible acts committed against people through [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=369.52s)]
*  the deportation processes and all that, doesn't matter. Honestly, Biden bungled the border issue [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  so much and Democrats tried to gaslight American voters so much about that issue. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  It created a vacuum and it made people desperate for anyone to do something. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=395.76000000000005s)]
*  And so yeah, they approve of what Trump is doing with immigration. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  That's what happens when Democrats are losers who refuse to acknowledge their failures and fix it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=404.0s)]
*  But I'm the bad guy for mentioning that, right? I'm the bad guy. Okay, well, congratulations. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=411.68s)]
*  It's not just that. I think Biden's immigration policy was just a radical shift. You can say, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=416.8s)]
*  we as a country are pretty great and should be able to absorb 8 million new people. I tend to be on [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  that side of things. But most people felt like it was too much, too soon, and wanted something [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=431.76s)]
*  done about it. And I think immigration is the only one where he's actually going out and selling a [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  story. Yeah, all the crazy stuff about El Salvador and blah, blah, blah. They're criminals. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=444.24s)]
*  We're deporting criminals, gangs, criminals. We're getting them out of here. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  Never mind that the net deportation actual numbers aren't actually that sick. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=451.68s)]
*  If you were somebody who's into that type of thing, you would have thought that Trump would [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=458.8s)]
*  have been deporting hundreds and thousands by the day. By now, that's not actually happening. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=463.44s)]
*  But I think the coverage that he's getting, I think people that wanted to see something done [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  on immigration are like, look, even if it's not happening, this guy is actually stopping the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=473.2s)]
*  sort of migration at the border, at the southern border. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=479.44000000000005s)]
*  And it feels like he's trying to do something about a situation that people saw as unwieldy, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=482.56s)]
*  unruly, and needed to be gotten under control. Again, you can agree or disagree with that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=488.48s)]
*  statement. I happen to be, again, somebody who thinks we got plenty of room for people. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=495.6s)]
*  We got to challenge you on this because- Sure. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=501.2s)]
*  Look, I used to say these things, right? Because it feels good. And you come across as a good, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=506.0s)]
*  kind person when you're like, no, we've got room, we've got resources, it's fine. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=511.04s)]
*  But how do you, on one hand, acknowledge that we are short, 4 million housing units, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=515.28s)]
*  and then at the same time say that it's totally fine that 8 million people cross the border? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=524.0s)]
*  Well, that's my point. We would have to have a policy that addressed that, right? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=529.84s)]
*  Right. But we don't, and we're not going to. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't think that America is a shack, and 8 million people are gonna make the shack feel cramped. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=535.36s)]
*  I think we'd have to marry that immigration policy that Biden had with housing policy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=541.2s)]
*  These things would have to be working hand in hand. And we'd have to have an orderly process [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=548.24s)]
*  in terms of processing these people. I understand what you're saying in terms of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  like, all of these, the trolling that the Texas governor did, where he sends all of these people [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=557.12s)]
*  to northern cities. And in Chicago and New York, it's like, everybody's looking like, bro, we don't [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=564.0s)]
*  have space for these extra people. It's true, they don't have space for these extra people. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=569.68s)]
*  And that's because there's no coherent policy in terms of how we're intaking these folks. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=574.8s)]
*  My argument is that America isn't some tiny country that's overflowing in population, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=579.68s)]
*  and somehow adding 8 million people to 360 million or whatever it is, now makes it so [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=587.12s)]
*  that we're all cramped and it's busting at the seams. That's the point that I would make. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=593.68s)]
*  Yeah, and look, I agree with you on that. But this also speaks to- [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=597.5999999999999s)]
*  You would have to have vision. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you'd have to have vision, you'd have to have a plan. And this also speaks to the failure [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=603.68s)]
*  of the Democratic Party because Biden didn't have control of the border. He didn't have a plan, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=607.92s)]
*  a real robust plan in place to build the housing units necessary, not only to accommodate an influx [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=614.56s)]
*  of migrants, but to accommodate the population of Americans that are already here. So I'm not [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=621.8399999999999s)]
*  interested in hearing anything from any Democratic member of Congress or any Democratic candidate [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=629.8399999999999s)]
*  running for president about how pro-immigration they are if they don't have a real plan in place [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=636.24s)]
*  to build housing in this country. Okay, I don't want to hear about a subsidy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=642.72s)]
*  We're going to give you $25,000 toward your mortgage if you're a first-time homebuyer. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=646.96s)]
*  We need housing. We don't need the subsidy. We need you to build the effing housing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=651.2s)]
*  Okay, we need you to get involved in these states that have ridiculous zoning laws [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=656.24s)]
*  intended to basically prevent the construction of homes to protect the assets of homeowners [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  that already exist. That's the reality of the situation. They use phony environmental excuses [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=668.0s)]
*  for not wanting to build the houses. I'm sick of it. I'm not buying it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=674.0s)]
*  And unless Democrats do something about that, I don't want to hear about their take on anything [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=677.68s)]
*  else because that is really the core of a lot of the economic frustration that Americans are feeling. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=681.92s)]
*  And what happens when Americans feel economically frustrated? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=687.84s)]
*  And then you have someone like Donald Trump who directs their frustration toward migrants, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=691.6800000000001s)]
*  toward all sorts of vulnerable people, right? They're the cause of your pain and suffering. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=698.72s)]
*  So I'm sorry, this environment was partially manufactured, created by the Democratic Party. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=704.08s)]
*  And so while they're constantly crying about Trump, I'd like them to look inward a little bit [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=711.84s)]
*  and take note of their own failures that got us to the point that we're in right now. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=715.92s)]
*  And we'll end with one more point of data from a recent NBC News poll that could be a positive [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=720.4799999999999s)]
*  sign for Trump's second term. More registered voters see the United States as heading, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=726.0s)]
*  my God, this is amazing, in the right direction. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=730.4s)]
*  Then at any point since early 2004, though a majority still say the country is on the wrong [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=733.8399999999999s)]
*  track. I don't even know what that means. What does that even mean? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=740.48s)]
*  I don't know. I can't make heads or tails of that. I just think that that just means [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=746.4s)]
*  Republicans are more enthusiastic. They're as enthusiastic about Donald Trump as Republicans [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  were post 9-11. Bush kicking John Kerry's butt in the election in 04. I think post that, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=765.68s)]
*  Republicans are as happy as they've ever been with their candidate. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=778.0s)]
*  That's what I think that speaks to. That's the only thing that makes any type of sense. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=781.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, 90% of Republican voters are happy with the Trump administration. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=786.24s)]
*  That is the only thing that matters to Trump. He is not gonna change a damn thing as long as [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  his base is happy with what he's doing. I don't know why his base is happy with what he's doing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=798.88s)]
*  I mean, maybe the immigration thing is enough, but I don't know. Is your economic situation [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=805.12s)]
*  better right now? It's not better for most people. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=811.36s)]
*  I don't think so. I think people feel like Trump is there to smash Washington. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=813.76s)]
*  And if you watch the news at a cursory glance, it feels like he's doing that. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=820.24s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it does. And look- [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=825.52s)]
*  And whether it's to the benefit of these people, he's doing what he said he was gonna do. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  Look, I will say this. When you loathe those in the establishment in DC, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  when you think about these institutions and how corrupt they've been, how much they've screwed [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=842.4s)]
*  over the American people, sometimes having a wrecking ball in office is enough, right, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=846.96s)]
*  to make people happy. But eventually, you gotta feed your family. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=853.0400000000001s)]
*  You gotta be able to afford housing. You gotta be able to afford groceries and gas at the pump. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=858.0s)]
*  You gotta be able to eat a pizza, and it's gonna be a Mexican homie making it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=865.5200000000001s)]
*  So eventually, you're gonna be hungry. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=869.7600000000001s)]
*  This is not sarcasm. Mexicans, low-key, are the most talented people in the country. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=875.5200000000001s)]
*  100%. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=881.6800000000001s)]
*  They're at sushi restaurants whipping up your sushi meal. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=883.12s)]
*  All of it. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=886.1600000000001s)]
*  They're amazing. And so, yeah, it disgusts me to hear the demonization of immigrants as well. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=887.28s)]
*  But that demonization is made possible by the failures of the Democratic Party. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=893.1999999999999s)]
*  You can't just say immigrants good. You have to create an economic environment in which [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=899.6s)]
*  immigrants coming in doesn't threaten the resources or the limited housing supply [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  of Americans who are currently here. And that's the way Americans think about it right now. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=912.24s)]
*  And also, the last thing I'll say about the Democrats, I think if they had done a good job [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=915.84s)]
*  of being like, look at New York City, look how sick it is, LA, San Francisco, the state of [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=920.96s)]
*  California, where these guys have a monopoly on power, and could say to people, look how sick [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=926.24s)]
*  these places are, don't you wanna be here? It's not the case. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=931.28s)]
*  It's not the case. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nclBhSuCQNE&t=934.4s)]
