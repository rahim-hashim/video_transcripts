"Actor Mel Gibson offered a bizarre quote Friday while he appeared on Fox News to praise President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent visit to California amid the wildfires that have hit the state.

While speaking with Sean Hannity on his ‚ÄúHannity‚Äù show, Gibson said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad Trump‚Äôs here at the moment. It‚Äôs like daddy arrived and he‚Äôs taking his belt off, you know?‚Äù*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Mel Gibson's CREEPY AF Comments About Trump's Trip To California
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU)
*  You read about hydrants that don't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=0.0s)]
*  have water, you read about cutting [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=2.1s)]
*  firefighters' budgets, you read [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=4.12s)]
*  about reservoirs that are empty. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=6.04s)]
*  I mean, it's gotta be frustrating. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=8.18s)]
*  I'm glad Trump's here at [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=9.8s)]
*  the moment. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=10.94s)]
*  It's like daddy arrived and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=11.58s)]
*  he's taking his belt off. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=13.42s)]
*  So I think you'll get some results [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=15.1s)]
*  here quickly. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=17.5s)]
*  Daddy's home, according to actor [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=19.7s)]
*  Mel Gibson, in regard to Donald [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=21.78s)]
*  Trump's visit to Los Angeles [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=23.7s)]
*  following the devastating wildfires [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=25.5s)]
*  that ripped through the city. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=27.96s)]
*  Now while Gibson's choice of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=30.46s)]
*  language is kind of creepy, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=32.26s)]
*  gotta keep it real. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=33.92s)]
*  It is definitely true that Donald [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=35.34s)]
*  Trump held Mayor Karen Bass's feet [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  to the fire during a joint press [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=40.04s)]
*  conference. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=42.16s)]
*  And I really, really do want to get [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=43.24s)]
*  into the details of this because it [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=45.28s)]
*  gives you a sense of how frustrating [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=47.46s)]
*  it is to live in Los Angeles and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=49.82s)]
*  deal with the politicians that we [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=51.8s)]
*  have because they tend to try to get [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=54.2s)]
*  dodgy, hide the truth and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=56.68s)]
*  sometimes they just lie to your [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=58.64s)]
*  face. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=60.6s)]
*  Without further ado, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=62.1s)]
*  let's take a look. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=62.86s)]
*  You mentioned a couple of things in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=64.12s)]
*  terms of us expediting. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=66.24s)]
*  So I signed executive directives [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=68.52s)]
*  right away so [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=70.58s)]
*  that we could cut the red tape. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=71.36s)]
*  We could get people back building [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=73.36s)]
*  as fast as possible. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=75.6s)]
*  And we're going to continue doing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=77.7s)]
*  that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=79.08s)]
*  We have- [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=79.68s)]
*  Yeah, the one thing is they are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=80.18s)]
*  saying they will not be allowed to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=81.4s)]
*  start for 18 months. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=82.92s)]
*  No, that will not be the case. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=84.32s)]
*  Okay, I just hope you're right. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  You can hold me to it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=87.52s)]
*  This poor group said that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=88.42s)]
*  No. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  That would be a, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  they should be able to do it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=90.98s)]
*  They should be able to start [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=92.26s)]
*  tonight. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=93.26s)]
*  That will not be the case. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=93.86s)]
*  But Bass ended up getting caught in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=96.06s)]
*  a lie, a pretty massive lie, and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=97.94000000000001s)]
*  Trump wasn't about to let her get [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=99.7s)]
*  away with it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=101.38000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=102.26s)]
*  You know first we have to take care [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=103.34s)]
*  to make sure that there's not [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=105.18s)]
*  getting rid of the hazardous waste, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=106.78s)]
*  cleaning things up so [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  that people can start right away. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=109.98s)]
*  We absolutely need your help. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=111.98s)]
*  We need the federal help. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=114.10000000000001s)]
*  You got it, I told you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=115.26s)]
*  You will have no permit problem. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=116.52s)]
*  There will be zero delay. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=118.6s)]
*  And as far as I'm concerned, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=120.4s)]
*  you already have the permits. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=121.56s)]
*  And I'm much more worried about [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=122.92s)]
*  the fact that they said it's 18 [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  months exactly, and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=127.12s)]
*  they were devastated. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=128.56s)]
*  They want to start now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=130.4s)]
*  They want to start removing things. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=131.28s)]
*  They're not allowed to do it now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=132.6s)]
*  And you mentioned hazardous waste. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=133.8s)]
*  Well, the hazardous waste, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=135.84s)]
*  what's hazardous waste? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=137.68s)]
*  I mean, you're going to have to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=139.32s)]
*  define that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=140.12s)]
*  We're going to go through a whole [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=140.68s)]
*  series of questions on determining [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=142.88s)]
*  what's hazardous. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=145.36s)]
*  I just think you have to allow [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=146.61999999999998s)]
*  the people to go on this site and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  start the process tonight. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=149.54s)]
*  And we will. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=151.66s)]
*  Except they won't, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=153.34s)]
*  and they didn't, okay? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=154.7s)]
*  So just to give you some [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=156.66s)]
*  background, this was a press [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  conference specifically about [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  the people who lost their homes in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  the Pacific Palisades. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=162.54s)]
*  They want to rebuild. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=163.7s)]
*  They don't want to leave. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=164.82s)]
*  They don't want to move out of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=165.94s)]
*  the state. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=167.22s)]
*  They want to rebuild their homes. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=167.82s)]
*  But they have been denied access to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=170.26s)]
*  their properties since the fire [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=172.7s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  And so the argument that we're [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=175.84s)]
*  hearing from Karen Bass is, no, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=177.62s)]
*  no, I have done what I need to do [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=179.64s)]
*  to expedite the situation so [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  people can get to their property [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=183.14s)]
*  as soon as possible. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=184.82s)]
*  It's just that we have to clear out [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  the hazardous waste. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=187.9s)]
*  She said there, you just heard her, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=189.6s)]
*  that they can get to their [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  properties immediately. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=192.38s)]
*  Later in the press conference, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=193.68s)]
*  she's like, in about a week, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=195.16s)]
*  because we have to remove [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=196.56s)]

*  Well, why don't we hear from [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=220.33999999999997s)]

*  We know that the first phase will [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=237.8s)]

*  up to three months, maybe even [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=242.20000000000002s)]

*  At the same time that that is [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=247.6s)]

*  you with the process of debris [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=250.4s)]

*  the hazardous waste will only take [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=258.44s)]
*  a week, right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=260.52s)]
*  It'll take a week, right? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  There you hear him say it'll take [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=263.9s)]
*  six months to remove hazardous [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=265.9s)]
*  waste. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=267.78s)]
*  I know that I complain about LA a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=270.94s)]

*  I was born and raised in LA. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=275.3s)]
*  I love LA. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=276.5s)]
*  It's the leadership in LA that's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=277.86s)]
*  frustrating, and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=279.58s)]
*  they do lie to people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=280.54s)]
*  So there was something cathartic [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=282.02s)]
*  about watching Trump hold her feet [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=283.58s)]

*  Yeah, that a little bit later in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=287.34s)]
*  the clip that we showed you guys, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=289.38s)]
*  when he said, so they can go and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=291.54s)]
*  right now because you keep saying [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  they can go in tonight. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=295.23999999999995s)]
*  And she said, well, no, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=296.28s)]
*  in about a week. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=297.29999999999995s)]
*  So is it now or is it in a week? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  Like, come on, you're in a national [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=300.35999999999996s)]

*  Have your story straight. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=304.76s)]
*  And if she said, look, they can go [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=306.24s)]
*  to their homes and do X, Y, or Z in [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  a week because we need to make sure [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=310.4s)]
*  that it's safe, that's a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=312.4s)]
*  defendable position. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  And I know a lot of people are [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  frustrated and want to go see their [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  homes right away. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  And I don't know what the hazardous [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=320.08s)]
*  waste is. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=322.38s)]
*  Lithium batteries from [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=323.02000000000004s)]
*  the electric vehicles. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=324.14s)]
*  No, I got you, but I don't. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=325.54s)]
*  So then how dangerous is that? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=327.14s)]
*  And if that's really dangerous, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=329.38s)]
*  why are we allowing lithium [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=331.3s)]
*  batteries in electric vehicles? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  So there's a lot of interesting [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=335.5s)]
*  questions there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=337.1s)]
*  But give us straight answers, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  because then it's super embarrassing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=340.1s)]
*  when Trump, of all people, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  catch you in a lie in a press [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=343.98s)]
*  conference. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=345.46000000000004s)]

*  straight, you gotta be able to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  defend it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=349.02000000000004s)]
*  And guys, this is what I'm talking [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=349.58000000000004s)]
*  about. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=351.1s)]
*  This is what I'm talking about with [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=351.64s)]
*  Karen Bass. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=353.0s)]
*  So we've got a poll right now in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=353.76s)]
*  the chat about is she going to run [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=355.2s)]
*  again and is she going to fail or [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=356.76s)]
*  not? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=358.36s)]
*  Go check that out. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=358.86s)]
*  But, Mike, she chose no leadership. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=360.2s)]
*  She comes back from Ghana. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=365.8s)]
*  Look, I know people hated that she [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=367.68s)]
*  was in Ghana. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=369.08s)]
*  There's a question about whether [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=369.6s)]
*  she knew about the big winds that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=370.96s)]

*  There is no question, she knew. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=373.36s)]
*  Okay, so, but even if you say, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=374.76s)]
*  okay, she went to Ghana, but [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=376.8s)]
*  she took a trip, it's bad luck. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=378.64s)]
*  She comes back. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=380.97999999999996s)]
*  Then, reporters ask her questions, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=381.7s)]
*  and she's not prepared. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=383.84s)]
*  And she doesn't have any answers, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=385.46s)]
*  and it looks terrible. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=387.29999999999995s)]
*  And did they not have any water in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=389.26s)]
*  their reservoir? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=390.9s)]
*  Yes, they had no water in [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=392.06s)]
*  their reservoir. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=393.06s)]
*  You could say you could make [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=393.62s)]
*  excuses for that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=394.82s)]

*  after excuse. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=397.9s)]

*  she feels like it's impertinent of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=401.85999999999996s)]
*  the reporter. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=404.09999999999997s)]

*  And you're not the leader in some [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=414.12s)]
*  red state in Tuscaloosa. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=416.16s)]
*  You should be held accountable by [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=417.96s)]
*  Democratic voters, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=420.0s)]

*  it was clear to me, watch the entire [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=463.78s)]

*  it takes six months, six months, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=485.88s)]
*  to remove hazardous waste. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=487.64000000000004s)]
*  Look, this isn't really spoken [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=489.68s)]
*  about, but it needs to be spoken [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=490.92s)]
*  about. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  The reason why there's so [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=492.76s)]
*  much attention on the Pacific [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=493.8s)]
*  Palisades is because these are real [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=495.12s)]
*  rich people, right? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=496.6s)]
*  They're wealthy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=497.9s)]
*  I'm not saying that to demonize [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=498.94s)]
*  them at all. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=500.65999999999997s)]
*  But because they're wealthy and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=501.62s)]
*  because everyone seems to care [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=503.4s)]
*  about the wealthy people more than [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=505.08s)]
*  everyone else. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=506.8s)]
*  Because look at Altadena. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=507.7s)]
*  Altadena is not a wealthy enclave. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=509.1s)]
*  Okay, Altadena was actually the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=511.58s)]
*  first part of Los Angeles that did [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=513.3s)]
*  not do redlining, which is why they [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=515.14s)]
*  have a sizable, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=516.98s)]
*  affluent black community there. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=518.06s)]
*  Who have now lost their homes, but [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=520.78s)]
*  no one's paying attention to them. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=522.14s)]
*  Everyone's paying attention to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=523.66s)]
*  the Pacific Palisades and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=525.2s)]
*  raised concerns about the length of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=527.0s)]
*  time it takes to construct anything [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=529.0s)]
*  in Los Angeles, right? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=530.98s)]
*  And so why does it take six months [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=532.56s)]
*  to clear out hazardous waste? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=534.8399999999999s)]
*  We're the highest taxed state and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=537.0799999999999s)]
*  the highest taxed city in [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=539.36s)]
*  the highest taxed state there is [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=540.92s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=542.88s)]
*  Why is it going to take six months [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  for the city to clear out [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=546.16s)]
*  the hazardous waste? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=547.56s)]
*  Explain that to me. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=548.8399999999999s)]
*  No, I really, I'm not kidding. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=550.0s)]
*  I have a significant question about [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=551.6s)]
*  the lithium batteries and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=553.52s)]
*  electric vehicles. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=554.8s)]
*  If this is what happens in a fire, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=556.02s)]
*  because there are fires in the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=557.86s)]
*  world, so if every time there's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=559.66s)]
*  a fire and the Teslas burn, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=561.64s)]
*  we can't go back into the area for [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=563.34s)]
*  six months because of the Teslas or [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=565.3s)]
*  any electric vehicle. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=567.5s)]
*  Are the electric vehicles safe? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=570.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=572.5s)]
*  I am asking that in a very genuine [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=573.1s)]
*  way. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=574.94s)]
*  We need to look into it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=575.74s)]
*  We need to do more research. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=576.7s)]
*  So, but the idea, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=578.46s)]
*  if my home burned down and they said [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=579.74s)]
*  you can't go back to that site for [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=582.22s)]
*  all of this time. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=585.2s)]
*  For six months while the city [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=586.8s)]
*  clears out the hazardous waste. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=588.08s)]
*  No, of course I'd be furious, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=589.52s)]
*  right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=591.04s)]
*  But at the same time, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  I believe in regulations. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=592.76s)]
*  If it really is dangerous, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=594.44s)]
*  I don't want people stumbling back [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=595.88s)]
*  in, right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=597.68s)]
*  So- They want people to give up and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=598.72s)]
*  sell their lots to the city. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=600.32s)]
*  I think that's what's going on [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=601.8s)]
*  here. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=603.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=603.52s)]
*  They make it so [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=604.04s)]
*  difficult to rebuild. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=605.04s)]
*  It is unbelievable. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=606.64s)]
*  Now, one other thing I want to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=608.6800000000001s)]
*  mention because I thought these [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=610.08s)]
*  comments from people who have been [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=611.64s)]
*  victimized by these fires were [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=614.02s)]
*  really interesting. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=615.58s)]
*  So for star Perotty and Jeff Fair, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=616.74s)]
*  both Democrats, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=619.3000000000001s)]
*  Bass's assurances are no longer [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=620.7s)]
*  credible after a city response that [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=623.14s)]
*  they viewed as appalling. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=625.86s)]
*  When they saw flames begin to lap [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=628.7s)]
*  their Pacific Palisades house on [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=630.58s)]
*  their ring camera, Perotty said she [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=632.38s)]
*  immediately called 911 requesting [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=634.26s)]
*  help. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=636.14s)]
*  The dispatcher replied, quote, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=636.64s)]
*  we don't have the resources, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=638.66s)]
*  everyone is out. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=640.3000000000001s)]
*  I know so well what that's like, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=641.88s)]
*  by the way, and they refused to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  take a report, according to Perotty. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=645.72s)]
*  In the week since the Palisades [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  fire, Bass has projected a brisk, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=651.0s)]
*  business as usual approach, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=653.4s)]
*  crafting a flurry of executive [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=655.36s)]
*  orders and updating residents on [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=657.28s)]
*  the recovery at near daily news [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=659.38s)]
*  conferences. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=661.38s)]
*  So I read that last part mostly [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=662.72s)]
*  because this isn't business as [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  usual, okay? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  You have multiple communities [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=668.2s)]
*  in LA County where people have been [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=670.04s)]
*  completely devastated as a result [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=672.12s)]
*  of wildfires destroying their homes [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=674.18s)]
*  and taking everything that they [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=676.36s)]
*  have. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=678.1999999999999s)]
*  So the business as usual attitude [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=678.6999999999999s)]
*  is not coming across as good [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w5eai6fQU&t=680.96s)]
