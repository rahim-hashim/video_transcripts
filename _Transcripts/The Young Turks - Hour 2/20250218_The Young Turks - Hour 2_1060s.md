The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Senator Shares Embarrassing Insider Info About Democratic Party
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY)
*  the big question for Democrats is what it means to be an effective opposition party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=0.0s)]
*  And I think there are two issues here, right? One is what Democrats should actually do to counter [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=6.8s)]
*  Trump's actions. And the other is how you should communicate what you're doing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=13.84s)]
*  We can't be afraid of failing. That's number one. I think that's the biggest mistake I've seen [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=19.6s)]
*  Democrats do is that we're always afraid. We're always afraid of failing, so we don't take risks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=25.84s)]
*  That was Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego speaking to the New York Times and sharing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=31.28s)]
*  some pretty harsh criticisms about his Democratic colleagues and why it is that they're having so [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  much difficulty serving as an opposition party or honestly these days winning elections. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  And there's one particularly embarrassing insider detail about the Democrats that Gallego [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=51.04s)]
*  reveals that you do not wanna miss, so stick around for that. But first, being too timid was [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=57.36s)]
*  far from the only gripe with his party. So during this conversation on the New York Times podcast, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=64.08s)]
*  Gallego also spent a long time sharing his views on why the Democrats lost touch with [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=71.2s)]
*  everyday Americans and ended up losing so much, so poorly in the 2024 presidential election. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=77.6s)]
*  Let's take a look. The problem is I think we have to separate what we're hearing from kind of the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=84.32s)]
*  DC crowd, from what we're hearing kind of in the streets, from what we're hearing about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  everyday common Americans. Because I go back to Arizona, they're actually not talking about USAID [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=94.24s)]
*  and they're not talking about the courts. They're still talking about egg prices. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  They're still talking about the cost of everything. So one of the things we have to be [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=104.4s)]
*  very mindful of is that we may engage in a fight, but the rest of the American public may not be [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  with us because they don't understand this fight. And we need to make sure that we're matching our [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=113.04s)]
*  politics to what actually is happening to our world because sometimes when we have that disconnect, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=117.12s)]
*  we miss and then we miss really, really badly. And unfortunately, now we know we can't miss [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=122.0s)]
*  because when we do, it has political fallout. The stuff that's happening right now is because [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=128.0s)]
*  we entirely missed where the American public was during the 2024 election. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=132.8s)]
*  Well, look, much like the Republicans in Congress, who by the way, also have [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  super low approval ratings, Democrats just don't talk to normal people. He's right about that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  But at this point, Cenk, I don't even think Democrats are even capable of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=151.52s)]
*  connecting with normal people. We're talking about multi-millionaires. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=156.4s)]
*  Okay, we're talking about people who live a completely different lifestyle from the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=160.56s)]
*  vast majority of Americans, including their constituents. And look, you're an incumbent. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=163.76s)]
*  More often than not, you're able to just ride, you're able to coast. You're the incumbent. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  And people just vote based on party lines. So if you're living in a blue state or a blue district, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=175.12s)]
*  you're gonna get reelected as the incumbent. You don't really have to go out of your way [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=181.04s)]
*  to connect to ordinary, everyday Americans. But that has this deteriorating effect on the party [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=185.04s)]
*  as a whole throughout the decades. And I think that's part of the reason why the Democrats find [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  themselves in the position they're in right now. They don't understand ordinary Americans. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=195.84s)]
*  They don't seem to care about workers. I've said this before, I'll say it again. They seem to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=200.0s)]
*  almost loathe the Democratic base, meaning the voters. And they feel entitled to getting [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=204.08s)]
*  reelected. They feel entitled to Democratic voters literally doing the work for them to help [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=210.0s)]
*  them get elected and reelected. It's pathetic. So I largely agree with what Gallego is saying here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=216.24s)]
*  And look, a lot of them are too old. They need to retire. They need to make way for young, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=222.8s)]
*  fresh, Democratic leadership. But they're unwilling to do that, and it makes me sick. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=229.36s)]
*  So that's why the Democrats are losing. What do you think? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=234.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think Gallego is an interesting cat. He just became a senator, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=237.04s)]
*  historically a little bit more progressive, a little bit of populist, etc. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=241.04s)]
*  Had an interesting vote recently. Maybe we'll get to that on immigration. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=245.68s)]
*  So his first thought on don't be afraid, that's what the problem with the Democrats is. I totally [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=249.84s)]
*  agree. And I'm gonna explain why the Democrats are so rudderless in a second. But it's absolutely, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  like, okay, wait, is a poll tested? Did the consultant say it's okay? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=263.76s)]
*  Did the donors say it's okay? I don't know what to do. Do you have any opinions? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=267.6s)]
*  Forget the polls and the consultants and stuff. Just like you, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=273.76s)]
*  whoever. Do you actually hold any principles? Are you passionate about anything? So when [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=279.52s)]
*  Trump does something wrong or the American people are not getting something, higher wages, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=288.56s)]
*  healthcare, etc. Does that bother you? Does that make you angry? We know the answer. No, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=293.36s)]
*  they're all insipid vanilla cardboard cutouts that are sent in by an assembly line of corporate [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  donors. So they're not animated to begin with, let alone making mistakes. I make 100 mistakes. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  Why? Because I give a damn about things. So I just charge into a fight. And when you charge into a [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  fight, I mean, hopefully I've thought it through and I'd like to think that most of the time that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=319.28s)]
*  I have. But even so, you're gonna make mistakes cuz you're taking action. But if you don't take [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=323.76s)]
*  any action, you won't make any mistakes. And that's why they're frozen. They're like deer [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  in the headlights. So I disagree with him on one thing, Anna, which is, he says, okay, save your [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  powder for just economic issues. Now, that sounds like something that I would love, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=340.64s)]
*  I'm a huge believer in economic populism overall. I agree with that as your focus. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=346.24s)]
*  But I think you could at the same time say cutting cancer research is a bad idea. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=351.36s)]
*  Cutting treatment for AIDS in Africa was a terrible idea. Cutting the water to get lead poisoning, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=357.44s)]
*  I'm sorry, the resources to get lead poisoning out of the water, terrible idea. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=366.24s)]
*  And we can highlight those, we can talk about those, while not being hysterical and not yelling, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=370.72s)]
*  Nazi and everything, right? And by the way, guys, there's a giant constitutional crisis coming if [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=375.04s)]
*  he doesn't listen to the courts. Do not cry wolf until there is an actual constitutional crisis, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=380.16s)]
*  which by the way, might be days away. So if you cry, you can talk about, hey, why are we letting [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  the lead back in the water without calling it a constitutional crisis or without calling them Nazis [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=392.72s)]
*  or racists, right? But still be super adamant and passionate about that topic. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=398.08s)]
*  So, but the reason why- [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  Center the people, center people- [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  Rather than centering your hatred for the right wing as your argument. That's all they do. That's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=409.2s)]
*  literally all the Democrats do. All they do is talk about how dangerous Trump is, how bad Elon Musk [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=416.0s)]
*  is. I get it, okay. But when they make those arguments, the way they come across is a bunch [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=422.32s)]
*  of elitist pricks who only care about their own power, only care about getting reelected, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=427.84s)]
*  and they never center the best interests of the American people in any of the arguments they make. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=434.08s)]
*  And that has been the case since at least 2016. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=438.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  Right? Trump bad is not only something that most Americans at this point are fatigued from hearing [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  Democrats. That argument has made them so rusty in being able to make compelling persuasive [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=451.12s)]
*  arguments in regard to how they're going to serve the people. You get what I'm saying? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=458.56s)]
*  Yeah. So why do they do Trump bad, Elon bad, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=464.32s)]
*  in place of things that would actually help the American people? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  Because they think, exactly to your point, Ana, they think it's me versus them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=471.35999999999996s)]
*  No, brother, it's who's going to serve the voters better. I know a Democrat hasn't thought that, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=476.64s)]
*  other than Bernie Sanders, a couple other guys. They haven't thought that in decades. I mean, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=482.56s)]
*  I wrote about this in my book, Justice is Coming. We lost these guys. They're a bunch of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=487.28s)]
*  corporate goons now. So the idea of like, well, I was attacking that guy because it was between [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=492.64s)]
*  me and him and me, me, me, me, me, me, me. There's voters involved? Where are they? Or are they below [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=498.08s)]
*  us? Where are they? But Ana, you center the voters 100% right. Instead, they're centering [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=503.28s)]
*  Trump or Musk because they view them as their opponents. Or they're centering the donors, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=508.88s)]
*  which gets to my major point here, which is the reason the Democrats don't know what to do is [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  because of the story I did for you guys yesterday, where the donors have gone home. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=519.68s)]
*  They're now saying, we don't want retaliation from Trump. And we might work with Trump, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=525.04s)]
*  if he's giving away goodies. I'm jealous of my Silicon Valley CEO buddies that are getting all [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=533.2s)]
*  those goodies. I might just flip over to the Republican side. Now, without the donors, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=538.32s)]
*  which is what they base their entire existence around, there's just a bunch of lemmings going [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=541.76s)]
*  around. What do we do? There's no donors to give us orders. Where's our orders? That's part of why [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=546.4000000000001s)]
*  they're frozen. So we've got two more videos. I actually want to go to the next clip where [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=552.72s)]
*  Gallego was asked why Donald Trump was able to connect with Latino voters, especially Latino men [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=559.2800000000001s)]
*  a lot more this time around. Gallego argues it was because Trump was willing to meet them where [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  they're at. Let's take a look. The way that Trump communicates is actually more apt to get [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=572.6400000000001s)]
*  younger Latino men voters. Because where they gather their information, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=580.1600000000001s)]
*  where they listen to politics is where Trump is more often versus where we are. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=584.32s)]
*  He's on podcasts all the time. He's at UFC fights, right? He's at all these things where they actually [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=590.48s)]
*  see him being a real quote unquote man. And going into the election 2023, I also warned [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  Democrats about that we needed to get out there. I had a lot of recommendations that weren't listened [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=605.5200000000001s)]
*  to. I wanted President Biden to go to the Copa America game and sit next to some Latino celebrity. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=609.84s)]
*  I love boxing. I'm like, let's go to some boxing matches, right? Let's take some Democrats to boxing [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=615.52s)]
*  matches and meet where a lot of Latinos are. And the fact is when you go into a big election in 2024, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=620.0s)]
*  and you're going to have a lot of young men coming to vote for the first time that didn't vote in [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  2022. And all they're learning about politics is through podcasts, through UFC fights. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=631.6800000000001s)]
*  We're going to start losing that vote if we don't, and we did, and we need to figure out [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=639.36s)]
*  how to get into that world. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=642.72s)]
*  Well, yeah, the idea that Biden was going to go to a UFC fight or go to a soccer game is laughable, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=643.84s)]
*  right? I mean, the way Biden was sold to Democratic voters and some independents in 2020 was [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=657.2s)]
*  things are really chaotic right now and we just want to go back to normalcy. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  And so we long for the days of the Obama administration. Biden was in the Obama [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=668.16s)]
*  administration as VP. Let's just vote him into office. And he promises he's only gonna run for [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  one term. Well, obviously that was a lie. Look, the biggest issue, Cenk, is yes, the donors, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=679.68s)]
*  which you love to harp on because of good reason. The donors have totally corrupted [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  the Democratic Party where they are now literally paid to forget what's in the best interest of [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=690.16s)]
*  ordinary working class Americans. But on top of that, they lack energy, they lack charisma. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=696.0s)]
*  Watch any Senate hearing, any House hearing involving Democratic leadership, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=705.44s)]
*  and they'll put you to sleep. Super uninspiring. What do they even stand for? What do they [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=712.0s)]
*  represent? I don't even know. At this point, I don't know what the Democratic Party stands for. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=717.2s)]
*  I don't know what their identity is. Yeah, well, 95% of the time, the person with [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=721.36s)]
*  more money wins. So these guys were not picked based on being charismatic and being able to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=725.68s)]
*  appeal to the voters. They were picked based on their ability to fillate donors. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=731.3599999999999s)]
*  So that's true of the Uniparty, both establishment Democrats and establishment Republicans. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=736.64s)]
*  That's why Trump won so easily, cuz he went into debates with a bunch of people who are all robots. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=741.92s)]
*  And they're like, we have been told that this is great and that is great and tax cuts are great for [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=748.64s)]
*  American people, give everything to the rich. And Trump was like, yeah, whatever, I'm gonna speak [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=755.1199999999999s)]
*  like a normal person and I'm gonna make a thousand mistakes. But at least I look human as opposed to [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=759.92s)]
*  these guys who just came off the assembly line. And on our side, we had Bernie and same thing, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  but our assembly line beat Bernie. Their assembly line lost to Donald Trump. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=770.8s)]
*  So that's the difference between the two parties. And Gallego's totally right about, hey, go out [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  there and find where the people actually are. There's a reason why they don't do it, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=781.84s)]
*  which is that they can't talk to normal people. I'm being dead serious. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=785.36s)]
*  Corporate Democrats cannot talk to a normal human being. You'll ask like Kekeam Jeffries or any of [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=789.84s)]
*  them, really fill in the blank, like 90% of the Democratic party. You'll ask them a normal [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=795.84s)]
*  question. They're like, is this a lot? Where's my propaganda? This is not allowed. That's why [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  they never come on this show. By the way, let's note for the fact that Gallego is saying how they [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=807.0400000000001s)]
*  have to go to these online podcasts, etc. As he's talking to the New York Times. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=811.36s)]
*  So I've seen this happen now. I'm not blaming Gallego. He's saying largely right things. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  But I've now seen this a thousand times. Well, they get a bunch of establishment guys on CNN, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=821.84s)]
*  New York Times, etc. And they're like, okay, what do you think populists think? What do you [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=827.76s)]
*  think populists think? Well, what do you guys think about real people? But none of them are [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=831.36s)]
*  real people. And they never once talk to a real person. So I'll believe it when I see it. I mean, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=834.88s)]
*  so are the Democrats flooding the online airwaves and going on left-wing shows, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=841.28s)]
*  center shows, right-wing shows, bro shows? No, none of them are doing that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=846.64s)]
*  Because they're scared to death to talk to an actual human being. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=851.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, they are scared to death to talk to actual human beings. And in fact, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=853.68s)]
*  Gallego himself called them out on that. Let's take a look. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=859.68s)]
*  Look, I was actually shocked to learn that President Trump was the first sitting president [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=863.2s)]
*  to go to a Super Bowl game. Yeah, and he'll go to UFC fights. He's gonna go to soccer games. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=869.6800000000001s)]
*  He's gonna do everything, right? And why are we not doing it? I'll tell you why, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=873.36s)]
*  because I have heard this before. I'm not gonna tell you which politician was worried about this, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=877.36s)]
*  but their staff told me, I don't want my guy getting booed. And say, well, so you don't [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=881.2800000000001s)]
*  expose yourself to anybody. Then you also don't expose yourself to anybody. And again, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=888.48s)]
*  this is just the president. This is everybody really running last year. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=892.88s)]
*  Yeah, look, I just, these people are pathetic. What else can you say about it, Cenk? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=895.6s)]
*  Yeah, last thing is, when Biden refused to go to last Super Bowl interview, that's when alarm [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=901.92s)]
*  bells started ringing even in DC. And that's when he lost smart people like Ezra Klein and [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=908.0s)]
*  Nate Silver and others. And even David Axelrod, they're like, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=913.76s)]
*  you're not doing the Super Bowl interview. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  The softest interview of all interviews, and the one that goes to the most amount of people. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=922.4s)]
*  If you don't do the Super Bowl interview, then you're not gonna do any interviews. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=929.6800000000001s)]
*  You're not gonna even participate in this race. What are you doing? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=933.44s)]
*  And that's when they began to realize that his brain had melted, something we realized [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=937.52s)]
*  a year before then, right? And so now though, look at what Gallego is saying. It's not just Biden. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=942.0s)]
*  Fine, Biden had dementia, couldn't answer questions. But Kamala Harris didn't have dementia. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=949.28s)]
*  99% of the Democratic Party right now presumably doesn't have dementia. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  Where are you guys? Waiting orders from donors, uploading, uploading, uploading. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=960.8s)]
*  Don't have orders yet, don't know what to do. How do I oppose Trump? Okay, well, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=968.8s)]
*  that party's not gonna win. Good news though, we don't need them. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=975.52s)]
*  Let's go win the Democratic primary in 2028. These guys are ghosts, they're nothing. You see [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=978.5600000000001s)]
*  how paper tigers, I told you the whole time. Their only reason they won outside of the money was [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=983.84s)]
*  mainstream media, okay? Now mainstream media is defeated. They're in shambles. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=990.4s)]
*  So now we go and we do a real populist challenge to the Democratic Party and this time we win. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  Look, we're not even gonna have any opposition. They're gonna be like, loading, loading, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  loading. I don't know what the donors want me to say. And then we'll go and kick their goddamn [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=1008.4799999999999s)]
*  asses. These Democrats that are currently the establishment Democrats, they're never going to [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=1013.04s)]
*  learn. They're not capable of learning. They're not even human, they're robots. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=1018.4s)]
*  And the donors program them, we don't program them. So you're never ever ever going to get them to [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=1023.6s)]
*  turn around. Instead, you do the logical thing. You defeat them in primaries, then you take the [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=1030.16s)]
*  party. Just like Trump did with the Republicans, it's impossible. What do you mean it's impossible? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=1038.0s)]
*  An idiot did it on the other side. So now without Joe Scarborough and Whoopi Goldberg, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=1042.64s)]
*  beating everyone with paddles that dares to oppose corporate Democrats, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=1048.96s)]
*  they got no defenses left. Let's go kick their ass and take the party back. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lAY-z-7fY&t=1056.16s)]
