The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# If You Care About Fighting Back Against Trump, You Need To Watch THIS
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw)
*  This story is super important. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Rosetta Stone that [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=2.12s)]
*  explains to you what's going on [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=3.68s)]
*  inside the Democratic Party now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=5.28s)]
*  If you're wondering why they're not [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  fighting back, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=8.64s)]
*  this is going to explain. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=9.24s)]
*  And then at the end, we'll have [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=10.28s)]
*  a discussion about different [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=11.68s)]
*  strategies on how you can fight [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=13.02s)]
*  back. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=14.72s)]
*  But first, my God, the cowardice [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=15.52s)]
*  inside democratic institutions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=18.12s)]
*  So it comes from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=21.48s)]
*  the New York Times and explains how [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=22.28s)]
*  donors are reacting and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=23.84s)]
*  nonprofits are reacting. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=24.8s)]
*  So here's a summary, first of all, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  the demoralization and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  gripping blue America in the early [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=29.52s)]
*  weeks of President Trump's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  administration have left liberal [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=32.38s)]
*  groups and their allies struggling [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=34.2s)]
*  for cash, hurting their ability to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  effectively combat the right-wing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=37.74s)]
*  transformation of the federal [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=39.6s)]
*  government, okay? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=41.28s)]
*  So first we start with the donors, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=42.24s)]
*  real quick tease on them. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=44.04s)]
*  They say some of the country's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=45.6s)]
*  biggest liberal donors have [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=47.24s)]
*  pause giving, frustrated with what [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=48.68s)]
*  they see as Democrats lack of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=50.68s)]
*  vision and worried about retaliation [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=52.32s)]
*  from a vengeful president. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so now look, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  that second part is super [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=58.44s)]
*  disturbing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=60.0s)]
*  The first part is actually a little [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=60.88s)]
*  bit understandable, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  let me give you details on both. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=63.0s)]
*  But before we do that, I also want [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=64.68s)]
*  to talk to you about these [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=66.64s)]
*  different groups that are supposed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=68.08s)]
*  to be on the left-wing side that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=70.04s)]
*  are mainly based in Washington, and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=71.76s)]
*  their reaction is also not good. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=73.8s)]
*  So New York Times explains, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=76.32s)]
*  groups that support LGBTQ rights, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=78.0s)]
*  promote gender equity and champion [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=80.12s)]
*  other progressive causes have cut [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=82.4s)]
*  staffing announced that long time [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=84.6s)]
*  leaders are leaving. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=87.2s)]
*  Now first of all, cutting staffing, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  I can understand after an election, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=91.2s)]
*  especially when you lose, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=93.0s)]
*  you get less donations and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=94.38000000000001s)]
*  sometimes you're forced to do what [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=95.84s)]
*  you have to do. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=97.56s)]
*  So I'm not hating on anybody for [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=98.76s)]
*  that, but leaders leaving, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=100.28s)]
*  I thought, huh, that's a curious [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=101.76s)]
*  time for leaders to leave. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=103.44s)]
*  Well, let's see why that might be [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=105.44s)]
*  happening. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=106.84s)]
*  Well, charitable foundations that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=107.56s)]
*  have long supported causes like [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  voting rights, LGBTQ equality and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  immigrants rights are pulling back, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=113.16s)]
*  devoting time to prepare for [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  expected investigations from [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=117.6s)]
*  the Republican-led Congress. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=119.72s)]
*  No, wait a minute, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=122.24s)]
*  this is not time to protect [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  yourself. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=124.72s)]
*  This time to protect the people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=125.8s)]
*  that you're supposed to be [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=127.24s)]
*  protecting, immigrants, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  LGBTQ people, etc. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  So I get it, but if you're spending [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=132.04s)]
*  time preemptively defending [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=134.24s)]
*  yourself when you haven't even been [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=136.12s)]
*  asked to go to a congressional [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  hearing and you're stopping work [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=140.24s)]
*  on important issues, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  this is not the time. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay, so this is just New York [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=145.12s)]
*  Times reporting, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=146.52s)]
*  I'm sharing what they're saying. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=147.36s)]
*  They continue, unease extends into [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  the offices of prominent [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=152.08s)]
*  foundations whose leaders fear [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=153.76s)]
*  being hauled into high profile [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=156.04s)]
*  congressional hearings similar to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=158.16s)]
*  those that damage the reputations [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  of top college presidents in 2023. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=163.08s)]
*  You'll excuse me if I don't give [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=165.6s)]
*  a damn about your reputation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  Like that's what you're worried [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=169.52s)]
*  about? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=171.32s)]
*  No, no, that's terrible. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=171.84s)]
*  If I saw that, I'd be worried about [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=174.6s)]
*  giving you a donation, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  you're going to spend it to protect [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=177.76s)]
*  yourself instead of the core job. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=179.64s)]
*  It's unacceptable, but okay, again, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=181.72s)]
*  I hope the New York Times is wrong [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=184.28s)]
*  about this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=186.28s)]
*  I don't know which groups and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=187.68s)]
*  which leaders are doing that, but [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=189.06s)]
*  that seems like definitely the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=190.88s)]
*  wrong path to go on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=192.56s)]
*  Okay, now let's get back to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=193.92s)]
*  the Democrats in office. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=196.28s)]
*  Well, what are they doing? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=199.6s)]
*  Well, here we go, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=200.4s)]
*  Alexandra Acker-Lyons, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=201.44s)]
*  a political consultant with Silicon [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=203.12s)]
*  Valley donors that they consult, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=205.56s)]
*  says no one is giving until they [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=207.72s)]
*  see a plan for how we're going to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=209.6s)]
*  better navigate this unprecedented [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=211.4s)]

*  is a normal administration. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=215.36s)]
*  Okay, now that's fair. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=217.36s)]
*  Hey, you have to come up with [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  a plan, Chuck Schumer, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=220.4s)]
*  Jim Jeffries, etc. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=221.56s)]
*  And don't tell me we're going to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=223.16s)]
*  do business as usual, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=224.6s)]
*  what am I giving for? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=225.76s)]
*  Totally fair, okay? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=227.08s)]
*  Then, Robert Rabin, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  a Democratic consultant, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=230.88s)]
*  says people are mostly on the ropes [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=232.72s)]
*  or on the mat waiting for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=235.08s)]
*  leadership, scratching our heads [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=236.56s)]
*  and giving grace to Schumer and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=238.84s)]
*  Jeffries who are saying, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=240.72s)]
*  pick your battles. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=242.24s)]
*  Yes, but Chuck Hakeem, which ones? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  At some point you have to say, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=247.2s)]
*  this is a battle. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=248.88s)]
*  Like for example, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=250.16s)]
*  here on the Young Turks, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=251.16s)]
*  we said pick your battles, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=252.56s)]
*  don't worry, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=254.0s)]
*  he's not going to invade Canada, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=254.84s)]
*  focus on the money. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=256.68s)]
*  Look, there's Elon Musk at the IRS [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=258.48s)]
*  and at the Treasury getting [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=260.32s)]
*  access to information he [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=261.88s)]
*  shouldn't have. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  Focus there, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=264.6s)]
*  because the robbery is going to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  happen. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=266.68s)]
*  Focus on when they won't listen to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=267.6s)]
*  court orders, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=269.08s)]
*  that's really important. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=269.8s)]
*  So, minority leaders in the House [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=271.16s)]
*  and the Senate, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=273.36s)]
*  what do you think? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=274.48s)]
*  I don't know, but just give us [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=275.76s)]
*  money and then we'll come up with [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  a plan later, but for now, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=279.52s)]
*  we're picking our battles. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=281.2s)]
*  Okay, which battles? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=282.88s)]
*  None, that's not picking your [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=283.68s)]
*  battles, that's choosing not [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=285.68s)]
*  to fight, we'll come back to that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=287.52s)]
*  in a minute. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=289.36s)]
*  If people are frustrated with that, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=290.44s)]
*  well, we're all frustrated by that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  and you're not wrong. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=293.32s)]
*  Okay, but then when you go to some [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=294.44s)]
*  of these top advisors, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=295.72s)]
*  consultants, etc., [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=296.56s)]
*  Dmitry Malhorn is an interesting [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=297.8s)]
*  guy, I've debated with him and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=299.56s)]
*  then I got to know him. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=301.08s)]
*  I mean, none of these folks are bad [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=302.44s)]
*  guys, they all in their own minds [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=304.36s)]
*  think that they're doing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=306.16s)]
*  the right thing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=307.44s)]
*  But here's his advice on what went [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=308.2s)]
*  wrong, let's see if it makes sense. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=310.0s)]
*  Late last month, Dmitry Malhorn, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=312.68s)]
*  a former advisor to Reid Hoffman, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=314.4s)]
*  who remains close to him, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=316.08s)]
*  emailed his political list [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=317.36s)]
*  complaining that Democrats should [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=318.56s)]
*  have committed what he called [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=320.08s)]
*  Biden side by pressuring the former [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  president to exit the race. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=323.8s)]
*  So Biden should have stayed [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=327.68s)]
*  in the race, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=329.0s)]
*  that's the genius idea we have now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=329.76s)]
*  Maybe we can bring him back, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=332.56s)]
*  run in 2028. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=333.96s)]
*  No, that's a terrible idea, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=335.12s)]
*  an unmitigated disaster. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't mean bringing him back, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=338.84s)]
*  I mean the idea that Biden should [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=340.36s)]
*  have stayed in the race and then [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=342.0s)]
*  his dimensionally nasty would have [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=343.68s)]
*  somehow miraculously won. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=345.64s)]
*  If we just did enough propaganda, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=347.28s)]
*  yeah, he's young and dynamic. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=350.2s)]
*  He's 28% or whatever day he was [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=352.88s)]
*  down to on popularity at the end, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=354.6s)]
*  and the country going in the right [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  direction or wrong direction. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=358.12s)]
*  I bet 28% wins elections, 33%, 36%. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=360.12s)]
*  He hadn't been above 36% in [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=364.0s)]
*  approval in a long, long time. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=365.48s)]
*  That has no chance of winning and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=367.76s)]
*  the genius idea that he came up with [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=369.24s)]
*  so far after the election is, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=370.88s)]
*  maybe we should let Biden run. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=372.36s)]
*  Okay, but that's just one [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=374.24s)]
*  consultant. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=375.16s)]
*  So now, let's go to the big daddies, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=375.68s)]
*  these are the actual donors. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=377.8s)]
*  Jeff Skoll is a huge donor to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  the Democratic Party, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  he's done some wonderful things in [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=382.54s)]
*  his life. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  He did participant media, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=385.12s)]
*  they did great work. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=386.6s)]
*  And movies that you've seen, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=388.12s)]
*  the help, the one about Lincoln, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=389.92s)]
*  the one about the Boston Globe [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=391.92s)]
*  breaking the stories, etc. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  You've watched and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=395.16s)]
*  liked those movies that helped to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=396.04s)]
*  push the conversation in [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=397.8s)]
*  the right way, etc. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  So when I saw Skoll, I thought, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=400.76s)]
*  wait, what's going on here? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=403.36s)]
*  So let's find out. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=406.72s)]
*  Jeff Skoll is Silicon Valley [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=408.4s)]
*  billionaire and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  longtime friend of Elon Musk. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=410.91999999999996s)]
*  So there was an awful lot of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=412.64s)]
*  pressure to side with Mr. Trump. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=414.76s)]
*  Wait, hold up, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  what do you mean side with Trump? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=419.28s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing to hold back [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=421.32s)]
*  the money because clown ass Schumer [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=422.68s)]
*  doesn't have a plan, but side, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=424.12s)]
*  what do you mean side with Trump? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  Okay, number 10, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  some Democrats say a few of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  their reliable donors are now [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=430.44s)]
*  supporting Mr. Trump or at least [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  looking to curry favor with him. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  You cowards, what are you doing? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=436.88s)]

*  Look, I don't know about Skoll in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=445.16s)]
*  particular because of some of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=446.32s)]
*  the nuance in the story I'll [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=447.48s)]

*  But let me give you more details [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=449.24s)]
*  first, Adam. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=450.76s)]
*  This month, Mr. Skoll, who has [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=451.68s)]

*  currying favor with Trump, and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=486.08s)]

*  here's what he says. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=501.48s)]
*  There are people who are absolutely [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=503.44s)]
*  against Trump, never Trumpers, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=505.0s)]
*  who fear that they'll be [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=506.56s)]
*  retaliated against and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=507.56s)]
*  they'll have to leave the country. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=508.64s)]
*  Folks who wish to oppose him, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=511.08s)]
*  it may take some time before they [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=512.96s)]
*  gather up the courage. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=514.96s)]

*  going to listen to the courts. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=526.0s)]
*  Okay, all right, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  now we go to Reid Hoffman. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=529.2s)]
*  These are all the biggest donors to [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=531.36s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=533.08s)]
*  There's a greater than 50% chance [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=534.44s)]

*  He said he believed the donors [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=561.32s)]

*  Yeah, I had a huge maybe to that, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=567.4s)]
*  but the half a dozen that have [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=569.44s)]

*  Trump, that's a definite, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=573.4s)]
*  that's a yes, that already happened. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=575.12s)]
*  Last thing for now, and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=577.64s)]
*  then I'm going to tell you a hero [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  then we're going to talk about [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=579.8399999999999s)]
*  the right strategy. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  But that same guy Cooper Thiebaud [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=582.56s)]

*  bluster. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=597.52s)]
*  But Cooper brother, when you tell [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=599.16s)]
*  him that, what you're doing is [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  encouraging him to go after some of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=603.28s)]

*  look like a faggot. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=609.72s)]
*  And then you'll have to put on [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=611.0s)]
*  the pants for the rest of your life [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=612.36s)]

*  the hills. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=615.32s)]
*  Why don't you just send him a note [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=615.9200000000001s)]
*  saying go ahead and do it and we'll [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=617.96s)]

*  small dollar individual donors [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=650.64s)]
*  would be in this situation. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=653.52s)]
*  When you are reliant on big donors [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=655.48s)]
*  to fund your party, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=657.52s)]
*  to fund your opposition, then you [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=658.72s)]

*  Of course, the establishment [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=666.6s)]
*  Democrats are worried because [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=667.88s)]
*  they're using giant billionaire [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=669.36s)]
*  donors or corporate donors. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=671.0s)]

*  Rashid Talib, AOC, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=674.24s)]
*  but doesn't bother them. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=675.36s)]
*  I think that on the donation side, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=677.68s)]
*  all this does to me is illustrate [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=680.0s)]
*  the need to get away from corporate [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  donations or billionaire donors to [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  a people powered donation strategy. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=686.76s)]
*  I mean, even in the movement, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=689.76s)]
*  you're talking about some leaders [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=691.4s)]

*  advocacy organizations struggling. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=695.12s)]
*  But there are others who are doing [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=698.16s)]
*  just fine because when you build [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=699.92s)]
*  a donation base of individual [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=701.76s)]

*  donations, they're activated at [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=704.96s)]
*  a time like this, they're upset. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=707.12s)]
*  They're frustrated with [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  the Democrats and they can turn to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=710.56s)]
*  an organization that will actually [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=712.48s)]
*  go out there and fight. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=714.56s)]
*  So the DCCC, the DSCC, all the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=715.96s)]
*  alphabet soup of Democratic [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=718.1999999999999s)]

*  As soon as it's inconvenient for [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=754.32s)]
*  them, they're abandoning ship. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=756.24s)]
*  But people who are driven by ideals [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=758.52s)]
*  and a commitment to them, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=760.52s)]
*  they're in the fight for [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=761.96s)]
*  the long haul. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=763.28s)]
*  So I hope, but I doubt, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=763.88s)]
*  the Democrats learn a lesson from [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=765.28s)]
*  this. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=767.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to Jordan's point, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=769.48s)]
*  how often do we talk about good cop [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=771.08s)]
*  bad cop, about how the establishment [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  Democrats are basically part of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  the unit party and their donors [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=776.16s)]
*  wanted the same things as [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=777.64s)]
*  the right wing donors. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=778.96s)]
*  And now some of those donors, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=780.24s)]
*  a lot of those donors are saying, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=781.8s)]
*  yeah, we just wanted goodies. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=783.76s)]
*  And now it looks like we picked [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=785.76s)]
*  the wrong team and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=786.92s)]
*  Trump would have given us [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=787.64s)]
*  the goodies. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=788.56s)]
*  So we're going over to that team. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=789.4s)]
*  Well, thank you for proving us [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=791.12s)]
*  right for the last 20 years. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=792.4s)]
*  So what are some of the things that [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=794.28s)]
*  people are afraid of? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=795.64s)]
*  New York Times explains that as [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=796.64s)]
*  well. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=797.96s)]
*  And at a November meeting of [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=798.48s)]
*  the Democracy Alliance, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=799.8s)]
*  a liberal donor network, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=801.16s)]
*  funders were advised on steps to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=802.52s)]
*  protect themselves from lawsuits, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=804.16s)]
*  audits and investigations. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=805.92s)]
*  Look at that, they went right to [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=807.68s)]
*  the IRS. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=809.2s)]
*  Elon Musk did, that's in the news [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=810.2s)]
*  today, and there's the worry about [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=811.76s)]
*  audits and investigations. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=813.8s)]
*  To limit legal risk, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=815.92s)]
*  the group has also considered [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=816.84s)]
*  changing its document retention [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=818.0s)]
*  policies to hold digital [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=819.4399999999999s)]
*  communications for only a month. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=820.64s)]
*  Because Elon Musk and the donor [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=822.68s)]
*  class for the right wing are now [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=824.4s)]
*  infiltrating all the data that we [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=826.08s)]
*  have so they can see all of these [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=827.88s)]
*  guys' information. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  So that's why they're [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=830.96s)]
*  deleting it quicker. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=831.72s)]
*  Much of the concern centers on [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=832.92s)]
*  legislation in Congress that would [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=834.16s)]
*  remove the tax exempt status of [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=835.8s)]
*  nonprofit groups that are found to [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=837.28s)]
*  be supporting terrorist [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=838.88s)]
*  organizations. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=840.16s)]
*  Wait, why is that in here? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=841.08s)]
*  Israel tried to put this in saying [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=842.88s)]
*  that if any nonprofit dares to defy [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=844.88s)]
*  Israel, we'll say that they're [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=846.9200000000001s)]
*  working with terrorists and [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=848.6800000000001s)]
*  end them. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=850.28s)]
*  And of course, a bunch of corrupt [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=850.8000000000001s)]
*  Democrats wanted to go along with [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=852.6s)]
*  that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=854.4s)]
*  And of course, all of their corrupt [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=854.9200000000001s)]
*  Republicans wanted it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=856.9200000000001s)]
*  But then they realized, oops, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=858.48s)]
*  if we do this special exemption for [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=860.36s)]
*  Israel, the Republicans can just [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=862.4s)]
*  call all left wing groups terrorists [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=864.4s)]
*  and end all of their funding. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=866.64s)]
*  Look at that, we shouldn't make [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=868.6800000000001s)]
*  special rules for [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=870.08s)]
*  a foreign government. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=870.84s)]
*  Golly gee, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=872.0s)]
*  you could have seen that coming. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=872.52s)]
*  That one hasn't passed yet, but [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=874.04s)]
*  they're now deeply concerned that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=875.44s)]
*  it's going to pass. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=876.88s)]
*  It had already passed the House [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=877.6s)]
*  earlier even in the earlier [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=879.4s)]
*  Congress, but it had failed in [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=881.12s)]
*  the Senate, but now it might pass [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=883.0s)]
*  both. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=884.92s)]
*  So buckle up for that. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=885.44s)]
*  And finally, Pamela Schiffman, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=886.68s)]
*  who's the president of Democracy [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=888.64s)]
*  Alliance, explained at least they [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=890.44s)]
*  are not running, and [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=892.32s)]
*  thank God for that. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=893.36s)]
*  Their goal is to intimidate us and [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=894.96s)]
*  wear us down, our strategy is to [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=897.28s)]
*  step up and [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=899.4s)]
*  step into a fight for democracy. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=900.32s)]
*  Okay, there you go. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=902.88s)]
*  So thank you Pamela Schiffman and [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=903.96s)]
*  Democracy Alliance for [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=905.88s)]
*  not being cowards like some others. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=907.2s)]
*  So now, Jordan, I also want to talk [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=909.5600000000001s)]
*  about strategies for [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=912.0400000000001s)]
*  how to fight, right? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=913.76s)]
*  So I think there's three different [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=915.76s)]
*  strategies here. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=917.5600000000001s)]
*  One is maximalist, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=918.4000000000001s)]
*  the second is strategic. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=919.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I named these, you can agree [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  to disagree on some of them. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=923.84s)]
*  And number three is don't fight at [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=926.12s)]
*  all. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=927.72s)]
*  Okay, definitely not that one. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=928.76s)]
*  And that's the one that almost the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=930.96s)]
*  entire Democratic establishment [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=932.52s)]
*  apparently is going with right now. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=933.92s)]
*  Schumer and Jeffries have no idea [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=935.68s)]
*  what to fight on, and [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=937.0s)]
*  they're not telling the donors, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=937.76s)]
*  they're not telling the groups to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=938.92s)]
*  fight back. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=940.16s)]
*  The donors don't want to fight back [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=940.68s)]
*  and apparently the groups are [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=941.88s)]
*  running. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=943.16s)]
*  So they're picking the worst [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=943.92s)]
*  possible strategy, which is run [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=945.68s)]
*  like weaklings and go, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=947.8s)]
*  please attack us. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=949.24s)]
*  If you do, we'll get even more [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=950.68s)]
*  scared. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=952.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, the other two are, hey, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=954.0s)]
*  let's talk it through. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=955.88s)]
*  Maximalists fight viciously and [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=957.24s)]
*  try to ruin any legitimacy they [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=959.04s)]
*  have, fight on every single issue, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=960.8s)]
*  even on losing ground. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=963.08s)]
*  Now I added even on losing ground [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=964.12s)]
*  because that is the [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=965.92s)]
*  maximalist position. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=966.96s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=967.84s)]
*  this is a position I've done before. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=968.4s)]
*  I've fought viciously, I've yelled [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=970.16s)]
*  and screamed and sometimes that [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=972.84s)]
*  works, especially when you're [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=975.08s)]
*  trying to explain to people who the [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=977.04s)]
*  bad guys are and who the good guys [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=979.04s)]
*  are, and sometimes it doesn't work. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=980.84s)]
*  It depends on the situation. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=982.76s)]
*  Here we lost the majority of [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=984.16s)]
*  the country, we lost the popular [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=986.08s)]
*  vote, yelling at the voters in [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=988.28s)]

*  racist and names are going to make [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=992.6s)]
*  you lose more voters, more support. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=994.96s)]
*  I think that's a very bad idea, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=998.28s)]
*  okay? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1000.2s)]
*  And I've fought on losing ground [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1001.16s)]
*  before and turned into winning [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1002.9200000000001s)]
*  ground on gay marriage. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1004.48s)]
*  But we had a sense there that, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1006.52s)]
*  first of all, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1007.6s)]
*  it was a constitutional right, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1008.16s)]
*  it was a core right. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1009.52s)]
*  And we had a sense that our [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  morality and the fact that we're [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1012.0s)]
*  standing for American principles [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1013.72s)]
*  would work and we would win, and [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1015.44s)]
*  we did. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1017.12s)]
*  But if you say, all right, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1018.84s)]
*  I want to fight on losing ground. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1019.88s)]
*  Who painted Hamas on the statue in [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1021.36s)]

*  No, I'm asking you guys to be [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1027.8s)]
*  strategic. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1030.4s)]
*  So what do you do if you're [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1032.3600000000001s)]
*  strategic? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1033.08s)]
*  You fight 100% on the things you [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1034.0s)]
*  disagree on with the Trump [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1036.44s)]
*  administration, do not run. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1038.52s)]
*  Okay, number two, do not fight on [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1042.04s)]
*  positions where they agree with us [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1044.3600000000001s)]
*  because you will lose credibility. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1046.76s)]
*  You will look like a maniac saying, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1049.0s)]
*  I can't believe they're agreeing [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1051.04s)]
*  with us, I hate them for agreeing. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1052.52s)]
*  Don't do that, bad idea. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1054.48s)]
*  Number three, do not lose [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1056.96s)]

*  I love you guys, but they're not. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1065.04s)]
*  The cannons have not rolled into [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1067.08s)]
*  Vancouver. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1068.52s)]
*  If you say that, if you keep crying [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1069.72s)]
*  wolf, when the wolf actually comes, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1071.68s)]
*  no one believes you. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1074.0s)]
*  And the wolf is here. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1075.48s)]
*  They're testing the waters right [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1077.0s)]
*  now to defying the courts. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1079.48s)]
*  If they defy the courts, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1082.0s)]
*  there is no rule of law left. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1083.52s)]
*  That's when you cry wolf, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1085.64s)]
*  because the wolf is actually there. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1087.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay, and finally, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1089.92s)]
*  build effective coalitions that can [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1091.2s)]
*  help to push back on critical [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1093.4s)]
*  issues. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1095.08s)]
*  So when Trump said we're going to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1096.1200000000001s)]
*  put boots on the ground in Gaza, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1098.16s)]
*  and we're going to take care of [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1100.32s)]
*  the unexploded bombs instead of [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1102.2s)]
*  the Israelis doing it, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1104.24s)]
*  you know why he backpedaled from [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1105.8s)]
*  that? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1108.28s)]
*  Not because the left wing called [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1108.52s)]
*  him fascist, that's Tuesday. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1109.8799999999999s)]
*  He backpedaled from that because [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1111.48s)]
*  MAGA said what? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1113.68s)]
*  Boots on the ground? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1115.8s)]
*  No. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1117.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so now they're not at [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1118.72s)]
*  a great position on that yet at all. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1120.32s)]
*  So there's a lot more pushing to do. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1122.8799999999999s)]
*  But at least we got them to move [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1125.0s)]
*  back a little bit by having [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1126.6399999999999s)]
*  a coalition including his base. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1128.1599999999999s)]
*  Or we could scream at the top of [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1131.04s)]
*  our lungs or run like cowards. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  I say we be strategic. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1134.6s)]
*  Okay, Jordan, obviously, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1136.0s)]
*  I frame that. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1137.76s)]
*  So have at it, Hoss, and any kind [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1139.28s)]
*  of agreement or disagreement. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1140.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned what I think [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1144.3600000000001s)]
*  is really my only disagreement [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1146.2s)]
*  here and that is even on losing [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1147.88s)]
*  ground because we've talked about [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1149.4s)]
*  before on some issues, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1151.24s)]
*  they're long fights. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1152.52s)]
*  So I wouldn't knock anybody who are [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1153.76s)]
*  committed to these ideals and [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1156.56s)]
*  I don't think the best description [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1158.96s)]
*  of something like that is someone [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1161.68s)]
*  who's literally painting Hamas on [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1164.04s)]
*  a statue, but [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1166.2s)]
*  that's neither here nor there. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1167.08s)]
*  That's a different discussion. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1169.08s)]
*  I'm with you on strategic. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1170.44s)]
*  And I think what we saw and [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1171.44s)]
*  learned in the first Trump term was [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1172.92s)]
*  we saw all this energy the first [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1174.92s)]
*  year or two, massive protests. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1176.88s)]
*  People flying to DC from all over [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1178.96s)]
*  the country for weekend after [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1180.92s)]
*  weekend after weekend of marches [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1182.84s)]
*  and protests and you saw all of [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1185.0s)]
*  this action and then people just [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1186.76s)]
*  fizzled out by the time the midterms [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1188.76s)]
*  came. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1191.0s)]
*  Granted, this came on the heels of [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1191.56s)]
*  the Republican's attempts to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1193.6399999999999s)]
*  repeal the ACA. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1195.6399999999999s)]
*  So you had an immediate threat and [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1197.28s)]
*  people ran on healthcare messaging [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1198.9199999999998s)]
*  in the midterms and [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  they took back the house. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1201.48s)]
*  So that was, I think, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1202.4399999999998s)]
*  one of the reasons you have this [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1204.1999999999998s)]
*  big win, his power is blunted. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1206.52s)]
*  All of those people just started to [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1210.08s)]
*  tune out for the next two years. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1212.08s)]
*  You didn't see much action, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1213.8s)]
*  you didn't see as much energy [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1215.36s)]
*  within the movement. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1217.08s)]
*  I think what groups and [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1218.6799999999998s)]
*  organizations have learned is you [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1219.9199999999998s)]
*  need to be strategic because you're [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1221.96s)]
*  going to burn out your membership. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1223.88s)]
*  You're going to burn out all of [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1225.96s)]
*  these people who you're going to [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1227.3200000000002s)]
*  need to activate at key moments. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1228.8400000000001s)]
*  And there might be a disagreement [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1230.44s)]
*  in terms of strategy on what is [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1232.3600000000001s)]
*  a key moment where we should go all [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1234.1200000000001s)]
*  in and that's okay. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1236.16s)]
*  I don't think we should frame [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1238.24s)]
*  people who might have a slight [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1239.96s)]
*  disagreement on what is something [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1241.64s)]
*  that we disagree on or where should [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1243.72s)]
*  we take a stronger stance and [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1245.8400000000001s)]
*  go all in on. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1247.48s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1248.64s)]
*  I think if people across the [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1249.16s)]
*  movement are aligned with us 90% [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1250.72s)]
*  of the time, that's fine. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1252.64s)]
*  If we have a disagreement here or [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1254.3200000000002s)]
*  there on what is a position and [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1255.96s)]
*  a hill we need to die on, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1257.52s)]
*  that's all right. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1258.76s)]
*  But I'm with you, I think we need [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1259.72s)]
*  to be really smart about how we [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1261.3600000000001s)]
*  engage over the next four years. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1262.76s)]
*  Because we can't look to Congress [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1264.3600000000001s)]
*  for leadership there. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1265.96s)]
*  We're going to look to [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1267.2s)]
*  the grassroots and we need people [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1268.16s)]
*  to be in it for the long haul so [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1269.76s)]
*  we can't burn them out. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1271.16s)]
*  Yeah, that goes in both directions [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1273.1200000000001s)]
*  and I totally agree with what [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1274.8s)]
*  you're saying there. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1276.2s)]
*  Stop attacking each other as [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1277.48s)]
*  an immoral, etc. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1279.24s)]
*  Okay, you have a different [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1280.92s)]
*  strategy. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1281.88s)]
*  Move on, be a grown up. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1282.48s)]
*  You do your strategy, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1283.88s)]
*  we'll do our strategy. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1284.8s)]
*  And by the way, I hope you win. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1286.4s)]
*  If your strategy is brilliant and [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1287.88s)]
*  great and however I frame it and [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  you don't like the way I frame it [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1292.0800000000002s)]
*  and you want to frame it in [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1294.0s)]
*  a better way and you want to go do [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1295.4s)]
*  that strategy and you feel like if [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1297.0800000000002s)]
*  you yell at him enough you're [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1298.76s)]
*  going to win, then do it. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1300.4s)]
*  So because we need to win, okay? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1301.92s)]
*  And stop worrying about what [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1303.32s)]
*  the other guys are doing. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1304.68s)]
*  Same is true for us, okay? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1306.04s)]
*  All right, you want to do the [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1307.36s)]
*  yelling strategy, whatever [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  strategy, maximal strategy, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1310.9599999999998s)]
*  have at it, Hoss, have at it. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1312.84s)]
*  I'm not questioning your motives. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1314.7199999999998s)]
*  Go ahead, have the, again, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1316.0s)]
*  I hope you win. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1317.52s)]
*  I hope it's a brilliant strategy [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1318.6s)]
*  and that somehow in a way that I [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1320.24s)]
*  cannot fathom with my life [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1321.8s)]
*  dependent on it, calling other [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1323.24s)]
*  voters Nazis somehow magically gets [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1325.08s)]
*  them to love us and vote for us. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1327.1999999999998s)]
*  We lost the popular vote. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1329.12s)]
*  We need to regain voters. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1330.9599999999998s)]
*  So the one thing I would hope that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1333.52s)]
*  everyone can do as a strategy, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1335.28s)]
*  willing to have strategy. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1337.48s)]
*  If you already run like the donors [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1339.1200000000001s)]
*  and apparently some of the leaders. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1340.88s)]
*  And if you aren't too busy yelling [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1343.16s)]
*  into the abyss, please attack or [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1345.52s)]
*  criticize their leaders and [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1348.2s)]
*  not their voters. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1350.48s)]
*  77 million people voted for [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1352.92s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1354.8000000000002s)]
*  They're not all fascists. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1356.1200000000001s)]
*  They're not all evil. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1357.64s)]
*  A lot of them agree with us on [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1359.16s)]
*  a lot of things. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1360.64s)]
*  Show them what we agree on and [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1361.72s)]
*  get them on our side so [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1363.76s)]
*  we can freaking win. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1365.68s)]
*  I don't think that's complicated. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1368.32s)]
*  But apparently some think that's [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1371.4s)]
*  super complicated and [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1373.1200000000001s)]
*  they can't figure it out. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1374.2s)]
*  Anyways, it doesn't matter what [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1376.16s)]
*  our disagreement is. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1377.56s)]
*  Go do a strategy that you think is [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1378.3600000000001s)]
*  effective. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1380.2s)]
*  And for God's sake, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1381.32s)]
*  get in the fight in a way that you [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1382.32s)]
*  think makes a difference. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-FNHvBRBw&t=1383.96s)]
