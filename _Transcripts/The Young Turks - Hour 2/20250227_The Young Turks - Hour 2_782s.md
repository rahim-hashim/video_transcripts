TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

*  Let's go to Saudi, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=13.08s)]
*  we need to bring it back. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Where's a 19 year old, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=15.52s)]
*  I've had one guy from high school [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=16.44s)]
*  just broke up, she's fresh, and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=17.86s)]
*  I can put my imprint on her. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=19.28s)]
*  Disgusting piece of trash and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=23.0s)]
*  self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=24.48s)]
*  Tate is now back in the United [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=26.28s)]
*  States and President Donald Trump [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=27.76s)]
*  is denying any and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=29.96s)]
*  all involvement in his return. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=31.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=33.68s)]
*  Now, Andrew Tate and his brother [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=34.32s)]
*  Tristan Tate, who faced charges in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=36.4s)]
*  Romania, flew to Florida via [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=38.76s)]
*  private plane after a travel ban on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=40.88s)]
*  them was lifted. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=43.52s)]
*  Now, Romania had implemented [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=45.68s)]
*  a travel ban to prevent Tate and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=47.64s)]
*  his brother from leaving the country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=49.72s)]
*  But all of a sudden, there was some [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=52.96s)]
*  pressure from the United States, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  we're going to get to that in just [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  a second. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=58.88s)]
*  Now, any initial thoughts, Cenk? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=59.5s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm fascinated by Trump's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=62.32s)]
*  backpedal because that goes to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=65.92s)]
*  show you again, he's starting to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=68.72s)]
*  feel pressure on so [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  many different issues from his own [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=73.0s)]
*  base. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=75.48s)]
*  And I am genuinely surprised that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=76.0s)]
*  his base started a bit of a revolt [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=77.92s)]
*  on this particular issue. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=79.88s)]
*  Let's find out why. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=81.4s)]
*  So NBC News reports that the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=82.36s)]
*  brothers left Romania while under [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  criminal investigation over [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=86.0s)]
*  organizations of having formed [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  an organized criminal group in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=89.76s)]
*  addition to human trafficking, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=91.68s)]
*  the trafficking of minors, sex with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=93.68s)]
*  a minor, and money laundering. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=95.72s)]
*  Now, they have not been convicted [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=97.64s)]
*  of anything, but they are facing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  those serious charges. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  They were arrested in late 2022 and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=102.84s)]
*  formally indicted last year for [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  allegedly luring women to Romania, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=107.88s)]
*  where they were allegedly sexually [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=110.64s)]
*  exploited. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=113.2s)]
*  Andrew Tate was also charged with [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=114.36s)]
*  rape, the brothers deny any [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  wrongdoing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  Their lawyer told CNN though that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  they will return to Romania in less [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=122.36s)]
*  than a month because they've got [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=124.44s)]
*  a court date on March 24th. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=126.28s)]
*  But Matthew Jury, who is the lawyer [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=128.0s)]
*  representing the alleged victims, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=130.16s)]
*  told CNN any notion that the Tates [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  will return to Romania if there's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=134.76s)]
*  a risk of them being jailed is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=137.12s)]
*  fanciful. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  Okay, I'm just going to end that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  part of the conversation. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=141.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=142.04s)]
*  They're not going back to Romania. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=142.56s)]
*  They're not going back. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=143.44s)]
*  You'd be mental to go back to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  Romania. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=144.92s)]
*  I really miss Romania, and even [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=146.24s)]
*  though they might imprison me for [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  decades, no, that's the last time [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=150.0s)]
*  they'll ever step on Romania's oil. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=151.88s)]
*  So Romania's directorate for [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  investigating organized crime and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=156.28s)]
*  terrorism said in a statement [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=158.68s)]
*  Thursday, the prosecutors had [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=160.64s)]
*  approved a request to modify [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=162.84s)]
*  the obligation preventing the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=164.6s)]
*  defendants from leaving Romania. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=166.72s)]
*  But it said judicial control [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=169.56s)]
*  measures remained in place, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=171.28s)]
*  meaning the brothers are still [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=172.96s)]
*  required to go back for [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=174.68s)]
*  their court date, whatever. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=175.72s)]
*  Okay, now the agency did not reveal [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=177.12s)]
*  who had made that request to lift [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=179.4s)]
*  the travel ban. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=181.52s)]
*  But people are speculating that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=183.12s)]
*  Donald Trump had something to do [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=184.6s)]
*  with it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=186.16s)]
*  So just weeks ago, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=186.68s)]
*  Andrew Tate had posted this on X. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=187.88s)]
*  The Tates will be free. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=190.52s)]
*  Trump is the president. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=191.88s)]
*  The good old days are back, and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=193.88s)]
*  they will be better than ever. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=195.72s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  And ten days ago, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=198.72s)]
*  the Financial Times reported that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=200.0s)]
*  the administration had pressed [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Romanian authorities to lift [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=204.72s)]
*  Andrew Tates or the Tates brothers [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=206.84s)]
*  travel restrictions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=209.32s)]
*  The Tates' case was first brought [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=210.88s)]
*  up by US officials in a phone call [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  with the Romanian government, and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=215.2s)]
*  then followed up by Trump's special [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  envoy, Richard Grinnell, when he [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  met the Romanian foreign minister [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=222.32s)]
*  at the Munich Security Conference, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=224.44s)]
*  said three people familiar with [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=226.76s)]

*  And that led to basically [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  Jerusalem being named the capital [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=317.59999999999997s)]

*  Yes, that did happen. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=320.88s)]
*  No, I hear you, but [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  he authorizes it, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=323.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he did authorize it in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=325.52s)]
*  the end. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=327.08s)]
*  And remember his donor wanted him [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=327.67999999999995s)]
*  to move the embassy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=329.47999999999996s)]

*  but the point that I'm trying to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  make here isn't about whether or [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=334.0s)]
*  not Trump did the right thing or [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  wrong thing about Jerusalem and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=337.2s)]
*  Israel. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=338.84s)]
*  My point is, he has all sorts of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=339.4s)]
*  people working in his [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  administration that he's named. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=342.2s)]
*  He's got his tax guide. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=344.44s)]
*  That was what happened with [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=345.52s)]
*  the Israel situation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=346.84s)]
*  I don't know what Grinnell's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=348.64s)]
*  actual profession is outside of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=351.08s)]
*  being his special envoy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=353.56s)]
*  In this- [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=355.84s)]
*  Goon, I think. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=356.35999999999996s)]
*  Okay, whatever, sure. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  But my point is people end up doing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=358.28s)]
*  things without informing him and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=360.08s)]
*  that could be a possibility here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=361.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=364.0s)]
*  No, it's less likely. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=364.55999999999995s)]
*  So I mean, look, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=365.67999999999995s)]
*  we don't know to your point. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=366.67999999999995s)]
*  But Trump thinks that these guys [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=368.44s)]
*  are part of the right wing base and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=371.28s)]
*  all of their masculine, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=374.8s)]
*  all these things that he likes. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=377.0s)]
*  Is he bothered by the fact that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=380.04s)]
*  they're accused rapists? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=381.68s)]
*  I mean, piece of a pod. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=383.4s)]
*  So he has no morality, so [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=385.96s)]
*  he doesn't care about any [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=387.28s)]
*  of the charges. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=388.56s)]
*  Like they were with young women, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=389.92s)]
*  there was no consent. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=392.48s)]
*  Trump's like you just grab him, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=396.2s)]
*  right? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=397.8s)]
*  And by the way, even if in the, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=398.4s)]
*  some percentage, small percentage [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=400.32s)]
*  chance that it wasn't authorized by [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=402.68s)]
*  Trump personally, and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=404.68s)]
*  it was one of his goons. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=405.88s)]
*  Does that really make it better? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=407.32s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=408.88s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  In fact, I mean, look, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=410.24s)]
*  the fish rots from the head down. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=411.56s)]
*  And if you have people working in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=413.88s)]
*  your administration who are going [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=415.52s)]
*  behind your back and making [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=417.28s)]
*  promises or engaging in actions [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=418.64s)]
*  that you might disagree with, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=420.32s)]
*  that's a problem in leadership. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=421.88s)]
*  Yeah, and so I want to get to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=423.88s)]
*  the right wing reaction in a second [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  because what Trump is doing is [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=426.56s)]
*  AB testing as we keep telling you, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=428.12s)]
*  right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  So he's like, all right, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  let's get him out of there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=431.8s)]
*  I'm going to be a hero. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=433.52s)]
*  I'm not a hero. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=434.48s)]
*  Mag is turning on me. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=435.48s)]
*  Hey, what name so? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=437.24s)]
*  Never heard of it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=438.92s)]
*  Okay, Tater Tots, never? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=439.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=441.24s)]
*  Their brothers, they're [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=442.44s)]
*  never heard of it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=443.48s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=444.88s)]
*  But okay, so but look, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=445.48s)]
*  he's walking it back. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=446.88s)]
*  The minute he gets the pushback, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=448.4s)]
*  he walks it back. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=449.84s)]
*  So- [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=451.4s)]
*  By the way, one other thing he [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=451.92s)]
*  lied about today, just to reinforce [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=453.32s)]
*  the notion that he tends to back [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=455.08s)]
*  pedal or lie when things don't [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=456.71999999999997s)]

*  He's like, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  I never called him a dictator. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=467.48s)]
*  It's like- [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=468.68s)]

*  His mental faculties are fine. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=486.24s)]

*  Though it is that, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=511.92s)]
*  Andrew Tate is the enemy of any [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=513.2s)]
*  traditional American conservatism. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=515.2s)]
*  Now look, and [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=517.88s)]
*  then Ben Shapiro piled on, etc. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=518.72s)]
*  I understand that that one's a [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=521.4s)]

*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=526.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=527.2s)]
*  So it's a little bit of both in [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=527.7s)]
*  that case. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=529.16s)]
*  But I will be fair to Shapiro [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=530.12s)]
*  because well before the ongoing war [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=532.6s)]

*  Andrew Tate's comments on it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=537.52s)]

*  He says America does not need more [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=551.12s)]
*  self-proclaimed pimps and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=553.28s)]

*  out of thousands of dollars. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=564.96s)]

*  if you're into American family [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=567.88s)]

*  I hate them, they shouldn't have [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=712.12s)]
*  been allowed back in, but [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  you shouldn't drive people out. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=715.4000000000001s)]

*  Byron Donalds is also running, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=734.68s)]

*  I'm curious whether the family [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  values portion of the Republican [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=746.24s)]
*  base still exists. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=748.4s)]
*  Is there a single voter that's [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=750.8s)]
*  left in that base? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=752.68s)]
*  Because if you were an evangelical [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=754.26s)]
*  family values person, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  you really meant it, which is not [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=757.4s)]
*  a big number to begin with once you [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=759.28s)]
*  say you really meant it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=761.0999999999999s)]
*  But if you did, you should despise [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=762.68s)]
*  Andrew Tate. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=765.12s)]
*  And again, to be fair to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=766.4399999999999s)]
*  the right wing, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=767.4s)]

*  this guy's terrible, and this isn't [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=769.76s)]
*  what we signed up for. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=771.4799999999999s)]
*  So all right, interesting rebellions [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=772.4799999999999s)]
*  all over the place. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ksrQbCOl0&t=774.64s)]
