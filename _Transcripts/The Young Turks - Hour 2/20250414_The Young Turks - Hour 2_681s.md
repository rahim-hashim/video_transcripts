# Trump Calls For CBS To Lose Their License In Unhinged Rant
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw)
*  President Donald Trump is once again whining about CBS News and calling for the network [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=0.0s)]
*  to lose its license. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=5.28s)]
*  What set him off this time? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=7.32s)]
*  Well, the network aired two 60-minute segments about Ukraine and Greenland, which at times [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=8.56s)]
*  strayed from the administration's preferred talking points. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=14.76s)]
*  How dare they? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=17.76s)]
*  What are they, the media? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=18.76s)]
*  We have a lot more details where that came from. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=21.02s)]
*  But Cenk, what are your initial thoughts? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=23.12s)]
*  Should CBS lose its license? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=25.2s)]
*  We're criticizing the president. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=28.12s)]
*  We're criticizing a politician. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=29.44s)]
*  Well, if you believe in freedom of speech, obviously they should lose their license. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=31.04s)]
*  Who do they think they are? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=34.8s)]
*  Yeah, criticizing their politician? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=35.96s)]
*  They should be canceled. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=38.6s)]
*  Well, is that really what Trump's saying? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=40.08s)]
*  Well, let's find out. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it is exactly what Trump is saying. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=43.64s)]
*  We'll start with the 60-minute segment on Greenland. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=46.36s)]
*  Greenland? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=48.8s)]
*  Greenland? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=49.8s)]
*  I'm not sure how you say it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=50.8s)]
*  Here's an exchange with CBS's John Wertheim and an elder Inuit statesman in Greenland. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=51.8s)]
*  Akalaka Lenga said, when he mentioned Greenland, like it was a toy or something, and then John [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Wertheim said, you noticed that? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=65.56s)]
*  And Akalaka Lenga says, we all noticed that in Greenland, all of us, and it was ugly. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=68.68s)]
*  CBS also talked to Greenland's former finance minister about the Trump administration's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=74.32s)]
*  plans to go after Greenland. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=78.88s)]
*  John Wertheim says, is there any sense that this is just about the ambition to expand [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=81.04s)]
*  and plant a flag and this isn't about bases and resources? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  And Melina Abelson says, yeah, but that's what concerns me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=90.16s)]
*  What we're talking about, we're talking about people who live here, it's disrespectful. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  Finally, the segment highlighted a poll that found only 6% of Greenlanders favor US control [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  of the territory. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  Then there's the 60-minute segment on Ukraine, feature long interview with President Vladimir [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=107.28s)]
*  Zelensky who stated, I believe sadly that Russian narratives are prevailing in the US. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=112.08s)]
*  How is it possible to witness our losses and our suffering, to understand what the Russians [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=117.04s)]
*  are doing and to still believe that they are not aggressors? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=121.48s)]
*  They are not the aggressors, that they did not start this war. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=124.76s)]
*  This speaks to the enormous influence of Russia's information policy on America, on US politics [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=127.64s)]
*  and US politicians. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=133.2s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky, Ukrainian president speaking again on 60 Minutes, he also told Trump that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=134.68s)]
*  he should come to Ukraine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=139.88s)]
*  Trump's not gonna like this line of statements at all, saying we respect your position, but [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=141.96s)]
*  please before any kind of decisions, any kind of plans for negotiations, come to see the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=146.6s)]
*  people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  Come look and then let's move with a plan on how to finish the war. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=156.52s)]
*  You will understand with whom you have a deal. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=160.4s)]
*  You will understand what Putin did. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  I have two deal, I'm sure you meant. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump was extremely unhappy with those segments, of course. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=167.8s)]
*  Here are some excerpts from his long rant about 60 Minutes, which were so long. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=170.28s)]
*  We literally don't have time in the program to read them in full, but here are some excerpts. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=175.12s)]
*  I just finished watching 60 Minutes, the fake news show that was scandalously responsible [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=179.76s)]
*  for removing a terrible and incompetently delivered answer by failed presidential candidate [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=183.9s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=190.16s)]
*  Now tonight with two separate but highly inaccurate stories about Trump, they're at it again. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=191.36s)]
*  The people at CBS fake news just don't get it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=196.64s)]
*  They did not one but two major stories on Trump. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=200.08s)]
*  Why, who is he, the president? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=203.36s)]
*  One having to do with Ukraine, which I say is a war that would never have happened if [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  the 2020 election had not been rigged. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=208.68s)]
*  In other words, if I were president and the other story was having to do with Greenland [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=211.52s)]
*  casting our country as led by me, falsely, inaccurately and fraudulently. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  I am so honored to be suing 60 Minutes, CBS fake news and Paramount. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=220.4s)]
*  What an honor indeed it is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=227.08s)]
*  He goes on more. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=228.96s)]
*  They are not a news show but a dishonest political operative simply disguised as news and must [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=229.96s)]
*  be responsible for what they've done and are doing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=236.84s)]
*  They should lose their license, hopefully the Federal Communications Commission as headed [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=239.5s)]
*  by its highly respected chairman, Brendan Carr, will impose the maximum fines and punishment, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  which is substantial for their unlawful and illegal behavior. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=249.0s)]
*  Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee and Trump of course has already sued CBS for their Kamala [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=254.24s)]
*  Harris interview that was edited differently in a social media post in fairness versus [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=259.72s)]
*  the 60 Minutes broadcast. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=264.88s)]
*  So yet again, the media really overstepping its bounds by reporting in any way critically [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=267.6s)]
*  on our dear leader. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=275.16s)]
*  I do call on them to apologize immediately. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=276.24s)]
*  So 60 Minutes shouldn't interview the leader of Ukraine in one of the most relevant wars [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=280.16s)]
*  in the country. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  Not if Trump doesn't approve it, not if Trump's not cool with it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  And what if that foreign leader were to criticize Trump on 60 Minutes? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=289.72s)]
*  No, no. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=294.04s)]
*  Well then obviously 60 Minutes shouldn't exist. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=295.04s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=296.8s)]
*  And Zelensky shouldn't have freedom of speech, neither should 60 Minutes or freedom of the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=297.8s)]
*  press, which is also in the First Amendment, right? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=301.36s)]
*  That should all be thrown away because they've hurt the dear leader's feelings. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, of course everybody in the right were free speech absolutists, but absolutists, you [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=308.64s)]
*  can't yell fire in a crowded theater. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  And obviously you can't criticize a politician if the politician is on your side, right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=316.4s)]
*  I mean, like canceling their license wouldn't be cancel culture, would it? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=321.4s)]
*  No, no, no, it's just that's right, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=328.52s)]
*  Actually that's like nuclear level cancel culture. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=332.52s)]
*  I didn't like something you said on 60 Minutes, I'm nuking your entire company. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=335.72s)]
*  I can't imagine anything more unconstitutional and against the freedom of the press and freedom [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=340.88s)]
*  of speech. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=346.68s)]
*  Okay, there's the other issue though, I can't let Greenland go because this is hilarious. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=347.68s)]
*  So this is one of my favorite things. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=350.98s)]
*  Charlie Kirk went to Greenland and reported back. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=352.76s)]
*  Now as I read you these quotes, I want you to remember, they actually did a poll and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=357.2s)]
*  only as Ben just told you, only 6% of the people in Greenland want to join America. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=361.2s)]
*  Okay, 94% are against it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=366.12s)]
*  But Charlie reported back, we were met by hundreds of people, people in MAGA hats in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=368.64s)]
*  the streets of the capital city, Nuk. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  People that love America that want to be part of America. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=377.0s)]
*  He must have met all 6% because there's only 45,000 people in Greenland. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  Or he met hundreds of people in MAGA hats that want to be part of it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  Or doesn't know how to count. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=389.64s)]
*  I mean, he's not good at recognizing things in front of him. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=390.8s)]
*  I understand one time he believed a dolphin fetus was a human being. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=393.6s)]
*  Okay, that was a great stunt that Ben did, you should check that out online. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=396.44s)]
*  Okay, but my favorite quote from Charlie is this one. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=401.76s)]
*  He says, a young boy comes up and says, Charlie, I follow you on TikTok, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=404.4s)]
*  I need to show you something. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=409.0s)]
*  Okay, so far that makes sense, that could happen. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=410.24s)]
*  He says, in my village, three hours from here, when we just kind of go out in [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=412.36s)]
*  the countryside, we find rubies the size of baseballs, just falling everywhere. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=416.4s)]
*  You're catching them like fly balls, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=422.2s)]
*  There's another ruby the size of, okay, fascinating. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=424.52s)]
*  And of course, he would like to give that to America. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=427.76s)]
*  Okay, well, okay, hold on, let's be fair. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=429.88s)]
*  Let's see what the young boy said next. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=431.64s)]
*  He said, the Danes, because of course, it's territory of Denmark, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=434.6s)]
*  the Danes don't let us mine our rubies, our gold, our lithium, or our gas. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=438.72s)]
*  And it's time for a rebellion against the Danes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=445.0s)]
*  See what the Danes don't want? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  They don't want rubies the size of baseballs. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=449.36s)]
*  They don't want gold. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=451.2s)]
*  They don't want lithium. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=451.96s)]
*  Neither do the people of Greenland. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=453.23999999999995s)]
*  They don't want any of it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=454.76s)]
*  They're just waiting around for America to come by so they can say, hey, America, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  would you like these instead? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=459.52s)]
*  Look, we also have lithium for the Teslas. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=460.56s)]
*  What a coincidence. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=463.08s)]
*  Okay, anyway, wait a minute, am I criticizing the president? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=464.35999999999996s)]
*  Should I be canceled? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=468.2s)]
*  Should my freedom of press be taken away? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  Should my freedom of speech be taken away? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, look, one thing I know the right wing is against is cancel culture. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=474.96s)]
*  And there's one thing I know that they're for, freedom of speech. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=480.4s)]
*  Look, brothers and sisters in the right, I'm not hating on you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=484.88s)]
*  I'm just asking you to make a decision, right? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  Are you for freedom of speech or aren't you? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=490.12s)]
*  Are you for cancel culture or aren't you? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=492.47999999999996s)]
*  Because you can't argue that that isn't against freedom of speech or [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=495.4s)]
*  freedom of the press. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=498.12s)]
*  That is, you can have fun, make all the arguments. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=499.08s)]
*  You should be a 60 minutes exception. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=501.76s)]
*  They should be a criticizing Trump exception. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=505.0s)]
*  But they're hurting national security. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=507.56s)]
*  But they could be affecting us. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=509.56s)]
*  Hey, tell yourself all the pretty little lies you need. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  But we all got eyes and ears. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=514.36s)]
*  And that is definitely cancel culture and definitely against freedom of speech. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=516.16s)]
*  Well, Cenk, to clarify, they are for freedom of speech for topics they like. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  Because we all know that the only speech that needs to be protected is [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=525.76s)]
*  uncontroversial speech that's on your side. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I forgot that part of the constitution. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=532.96s)]
*  When speech is on the other side and you disagree with it, it's okay to be for [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=534.84s)]
*  censoring it or canceling those people only if it comes from the left and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=539.36s)]
*  not from the right. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  If it comes from the right and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=544.72s)]
*  people on the left want to cancel that individual speech, they're being snowflakes. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=546.0s)]
*  And they should be canceled for wanting to cancel that speech, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  if that clarifies it at all. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  Also supposedly, the Trump administration despite President Trump himself kind of [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=554.36s)]
*  hinting at military action potentially to take over Greenland. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=559.72s)]
*  They are drawing up plans instead for sort of a PR campaign where they're going to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=563.4s)]
*  be trying to tell people in Greenland how wonderful it'll be under US rule. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=568.4s)]
*  And considering even a plan giving $10,000 a year to everybody in Greenland to [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=573.04s)]
*  become, to support becoming part of the United States. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=577.36s)]
*  Which let us get some of that money first before we go shell that out to Greenland. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=581.08s)]
*  But again, it's just this incredibly strange, deranged, twisted world we're [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  living in now because back to the original topic of media censorship and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=589.88s)]
*  Trump wanting 60 minutes canceled. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=594.48s)]
*  Probably his dreams are that the ticking clock at the beginning is just the last [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=597.32s)]
*  minutes of 60 minutes existing until it explodes. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=601.08s)]
*  But he doesn't want even what can certainly be argued to be [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=605.4s)]
*  partisan leaning networks canceled. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not like he is saying cancel MSNBC. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=612.2s)]
*  He's trying to cancel CBS known as one of the most down the middle, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  like thoroughly researched and presented news programs in history. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=620.68s)]
*  And not to say they never make a mistake. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=625.52s)]
*  He wants NPR and PBS to have their funding removed as well. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=627.92s)]
*  The most unsensational, down the middle, deeply presented in research and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  thoughtful programs. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=638.76s)]
*  So it's just clearly not even an argument with these networks that, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=641.5999999999999s)]
*  they're presenting something skewed. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=645.52s)]
*  Now that he's against that anyway, because he certainly is a fan of Fox News and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=647.0799999999999s)]
*  Newsmax and OANN and all these places. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=650.52s)]
*  But if anybody just wants to present the truth, if it's not favorable, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=653.8s)]
*  then Donald Trump has an issue with it and wants it canceled. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=658.92s)]
*  And that is the most obvious example of somebody who wants to [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=661.56s)]
*  control the press, wants to control the narrative, wants to control freedom in [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=666.88s)]
*  the country that's supposed to be standing for freedom. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  And that is an authoritarian government. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=672.4s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=675.0s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7URvy4iWqw&t=678.08s)]
