"Laverne Cox is no stranger to being marginalized, but has found an interesting way to frame it.

While promoting her new series ‚ÄúClean Slate‚Äù costarring comedian George Wallace, Cox discussed the importance of remaining visible as a trans performer, and telling trans stories. In the show, she plays the estranged child of an older man who returns home as his daughter for the first time."

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Laverne Cox SCHOOLS Right-Wingers
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw)
*  At the end of the day, trans people are less than 1% of the population. And trans people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=0.0s)]
*  are not the reason you can't afford eggs. We're not the reason that you can't afford healthcare. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=3.92s)]
*  We're not the reason that you can't buy a house or your rent's too high. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=8.32s)]
*  I think they're focused on the wrong 1%. I think the other 1% is the reason for all these things. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=12.64s)]
*  I'm not going anywhere. I have a TV show on time, video, honey. I can't go anywhere. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=18.72s)]
*  So that was Laverne Cox giving Democrats a lesson on how to respond to Trump's attacks [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=26.24s)]
*  on trans people saying you're focusing on the wrong 1%. The billionaires are in charge. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=31.68s)]
*  What is your reaction? Yeah, I love that she said that, right? People need to feel as though they [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=36.64s)]
*  have some sort of control over the world they live in. And I think that that's why [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  they tend to punch down. They try to pick something that looks a little scary. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=47.2s)]
*  And by scary, I mean unfamiliar to them. And then they say that's the problem. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  That's why everything in this country is going off the rails because people in this country are [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=55.2s)]
*  living wrong according to whatever their personal standard of living right is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  They want to feel safe, but the problem is that by protecting their very exclusionary [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=64.48s)]
*  sense of safety often means destroying someone else's sense of safety. And the fact that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=70.08s)]
*  Laverne Cox, who is a transgender person with a big platform, is saying on The View, which is, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=75.2s)]
*  it's not popular with our audience, but it has been on for a long, long time because it does have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=82.0s)]
*  a big audience somewhere. People need to be talking about the fact that the 1%, the people at the top [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=87.12s)]
*  are the ones who are keeping the prices of your eggs so, so high. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=92.4s)]
*  They're the ones preventing you from having healthcare. They're the ones who won't let you [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=95.84s)]
*  do direct file on your taxes. They're the ones who are preventing you from buying a house and who [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=99.6s)]
*  have kept you from that American dream. And that conversation is actually a conversation now outside [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=105.76s)]
*  of progressive circles. I feel like we've been talking about that for so long here on TYT. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=112.48s)]
*  Now it's becoming more of a mainstream talking point, which I mean, that's kind of the curse [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=117.12s)]
*  of being a progressive is that you're always gonna be ahead of that conversation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  So you're always gonna feel frustrated and waiting for everyone else to catch up to certain things. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  But it feels like it's finally happening. The problem is that it had to become so obvious [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=129.76s)]
*  and so transparent before the rest of the country finally bought in. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=135.52s)]
*  But if you look a lot of right wing pundits and influencers, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  they're starting to say the same things. Yeah, they are doing anything. It is the thing, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=142.88000000000002s)]
*  yo, Laverne Cox said plenty of normal things that make sense. Maybe I'm over it, maybe because I [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  listened to it for so long. Yo, when are we gonna do something different? It's fine to say it. It's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=152.72s)]
*  fine to give the different perspective. And maybe the point in saying truth like that is to maybe [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  ring a bell in some people's heads, have the light go off. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=162.56s)]
*  And it just isn't happening. People who know, know now, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  because it's pretty obvious what's been going on and what we're seeing. So anybody who doesn't [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=168.56s)]
*  understand the realities of our situation, you're wasting your energy and your breath on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=172.48s)]
*  Please stop talking to the people who obviously want what's happening. So the next step is once [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=176.88s)]
*  enough people, as you mentioned, yes, from other points of view, begin to realize it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=183.2s)]
*  Let's go ahead and start doing something. It doesn't mean you have to go and try and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=187.04s)]
*  kowtow to them or appeal to them or any of that stuff. What you have to do is just organize [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=190.32s)]
*  yourself and prepare for your own life to respond to the things that they're doing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  Because enough people are gonna experience the pain and the oppression that these guys are trying [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=199.12s)]
*  to put on them if they get their way. That's why we fight back. But if they get their way, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=203.44s)]
*  you just have to be prepared to then move on and then survive, continue to, because it could get [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  that bad. So I think the time for condensing and one-liners is kind of over. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a lot of arguments that are happening right now. But one, I think, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=218.88s)]
*  one bit of advocacy is the people on the left just need to be wildly advocates for the working [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=224.4s)]
*  class. And there's Laverne Cox doing what every disciplined political messenger needs to do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  This is what the right's doing. They're saying, you know why eggs are so expensive? Trans athletes [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  and sports. And by the way, that woman who was a boxer is a man. No, she wasn't. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=244.4s)]
*  They believe a lot of nonsense. And the faster and more directly you can point it [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=249.68s)]
*  to what the actual problem is, the stuff you can galvanize people around. I mean, that's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  I think the way forward. This is a thing that Cenk points out a lot is like, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=259.12s)]
*  have the optimism to think you can win over people who are reasonable. Have the optimism to say that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=265.6s)]
*  there are folks out there that if we frame things correctly and remind them that you're being robbed [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=272.4s)]
*  blind by the rich and they're trying to further blind you and pull the wool over your eyes by [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  pointing to problems that aren't real, they want you to be miserable. The leaders on the right want [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=282.56s)]
*  you to be miserable. And so all the things they tell you that they're gonna fight for to make you [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=288.88s)]
*  happy, you're gonna get them if you're a right winger. You're gonna get trans people can't play [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=294.32s)]
*  basketball in fourth grade. But I guarantee you, you're still gonna be miserable. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=300.32s)]
*  And the way you would be happier is if you go for the left wing populist stuff of trying to have [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  jobs in America, services for Americans, paid family leave and the like. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMsED7cUGw&t=312.08s)]
