# Dr. Oz Refuses To Say He Opposes Medicaid Cuts
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc)
*  I want a yes or no, because we all agree that we need to do more to fight fraud and such [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=0.0s)]
*  matters. But what I wanna know yes or no is since you cherish Medicaid, will you agree [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=9.24s)]
*  to oppose cuts in the Medicaid program? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=15.96s)]
*  I cherish Medicaid and I've worked within the Medicaid environment quite extensively [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=18.96s)]
*  as I highlighted practicing at Columbia University. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=22.98s)]
*  That's not the question. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  That's not the question. Do you think he ever got his yes or no answer? We'll find out. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=28.08s)]
*  That was Dr. Oz and he is Trump's pick to head up Medicare and Medicaid. And during [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=32.6s)]
*  a Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing today, Dr. Oz declined to oppose Medicaid [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=37.36s)]
*  cuts. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=43.64s)]
*  And that is exactly why Trump actually picked him to be the head of Medicare and Medicaid, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=44.64s)]
*  we can only assume. So before we go on, let's hear the rest of that clip and let's hear [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=49.84s)]
*  what he did say when Democratic Senator Ron Wyden pressed him even further. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=54.24s)]
*  The question is, will you oppose cuts to this program you say you cherish? Time's short. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  I wanna make sure that the patients today and in the future have resources to protect [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=65.08s)]
*  them if they get ill. The way you protect Medicaid is by making sure that it's viable [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=69.0s)]
*  at every level, which includes having enough practitioners to afford the services, paying [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=74.12s)]
*  them enough to do what you request of them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=78.08s)]
*  And making sure that patients are able to actually use Medicaid. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  The records show that I asked a witness who said he cherishes this program, will you agree [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=83.08s)]
*  to oppose cuts? And he would not answer a yes or no question. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  All right, so that obviously doesn't inspire a whole lot of confidence. Donald Trump, when [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=95.0s)]
*  he was running for president, he did say that he wasn't gonna cut Medicaid or he wasn't [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=100.64s)]
*  gonna hurt it too badly. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=104.36s)]
*  This doesn't inspire a lot of confidence that he's going to stick to that word. He did say [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=106.0s)]
*  also that he is trying to cut trillions of dollars from the federal budget. And a lot of people have [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=111.24s)]
*  noticed and have pointed out that Medicaid is right there and it's right for the picking. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=116.28s)]
*  And it's not just people who are saying this. This is according to the Congressional Budget [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=121.08s)]
*  Office. Look at this headline from NBC News. It says, Republicans can't meet their own [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  budget target without cutting Medicare or Medicaid. Budget Office says, the House GOP [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=130.2s)]
*  has ordered the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid funding, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=134.92s)]
*  to cut $880 billion in a bill to advance Trump's agenda. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=139.96s)]
*  So if you're looking to cut a few trillion dollars, there is nearly one trillion right [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=145.16s)]
*  there. And we know from whatever is on the Doge website that they're nowhere near hitting their [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=150.52s)]
*  goal of several trillion dollars in budget cuts. So here's some more from NBC on that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan in-house think tank that referees the process, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=161.32s)]
*  said that when Medicare is set aside, the total funding under the committee's jurisdiction is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=166.6s)]
*  $8.8 trillion over 10 years. Medicaid accounts for $8.2 trillion of that, or 93%. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=172.2s)]
*  When Medicare and Medicaid are excluded, the committee oversees a total of $581 billion [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=181.48s)]
*  in spending, much less than the $880 billion target, the CBO said. So cutting that from the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=187.4s)]
*  federal budget doesn't sound like a way to make sure that patients are, what did Dr. Oz say [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=194.84s)]
*  exactly? He said, have resources to protect themselves if they get ill. There's more, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=200.6s)]
*  but first, Sharon, I wanna ask you, what is the end goal here? Are people just not gonna have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=205.56s)]
*  healthcare? Is the entire healthcare industry going to be privatized so other billionaires [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=211.72s)]
*  can make money and then they can get their tax cuts? What is the goal? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=217.24s)]
*  I think there's two goals. We have a one man wrecking ball in Donald Trump. He is definitely [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=221.48s)]
*  on a revenge destruction tour. He believes he is a victim and was wronged in some way, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=227.56s)]
*  even though he ascended to the highest office in the land at one point. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=234.36s)]
*  But because he lost, that's a problem. Because he was investigated for real things, that's a problem. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=238.2s)]
*  So that's step one. The end game is the other thing that you mentioned, privatization. Okay, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=245.56s)]
*  he and his rich friends will take over the system. They'll bleed it dry, drain it, put it to bed, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  gouge the American people, we'll have nothing left and then that'll be success. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=258.76s)]
*  One day I'd like to go on a revenge tour. Everybody, it seems like a great thing to do. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=263.0s)]
*  I don't know who I would tour and where, but it would be great. Yeah, I mean, look, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=268.44s)]
*  Dr. Oz also, the motivation with Trump and the people with whom he surrounds himself is always [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=273.8s)]
*  money. And what can be gleaned from this is the privatization of Medicare Advantage, which is a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=280.76s)]
*  private insurance company. By cutting Medicaid and Medicare, you are creating avenues for these [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=287.8s)]
*  companies who are part of the privatized extra Medicare to make money. So you're privatizing, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=294.36s)]
*  you're making the rich richer. And that's exactly what Dr. Oz's mission is here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=302.68s)]
*  So by cutting Medicare, what are you doing? You're forcing those patients and that money [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=307.72s)]
*  onto Medicare Advantage, which is debilitating for the patients, of course, but enriching for [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=313.16s)]
*  the people who run the companies under the umbrella of Medicare Advantage. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=319.08s)]
*  Yeah, and it's really distressing because Dr. Oz is or at least was a practicing physician. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=323.16s)]
*  If he does or should have had intimate knowledge and understanding of what it's like actually in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=328.67999999999995s)]
*  the field whenever you're dealing with patients, you would think that a doctor would make sense [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=335.08s)]
*  in this kind of role. But we all know that in the Trump administration, you don't actually get a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  nomination unless you are above all else loyal to Donald Trump and whatever his agenda is regarding [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=343.4s)]
*  whatever department he's putting you as the head of. So Dr. Oz isn't there for any kind of medical [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=349.32s)]
*  expertise that he has. He's not there to give any kind of meaningful insight into the medical [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=354.6s)]
*  industry and Medicaid or Medicare. He's there to not get into in Donald Trump's way whenever [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=360.68s)]
*  he tries to gut the program and cut its budget. So- [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  And for Oz, it's always about money, right? I mean, it's always been like, what has he done? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=369.56s)]
*  He's made his name by talking about pseudoscience and embracing pseudoscience. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=376.6s)]
*  He's very, very specious medical treatments that he has promoted throughout his career. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=382.36s)]
*  And then on top of that, he's invested something close to $60 million, if I remember, in covering [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=389.48s)]
*  that campaign, the Fed or Mena's campaign, $60 million in his own investments in companies [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=395.64s)]
*  that dealt with Medicare, with CMS. So it's a very blatant and naked money grab [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=402.76s)]
*  at its heart, which is what you see so much with those in trying to get into the Trump [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=411.24s)]
*  administration. We've been tapped into the Trump administration where you see [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=416.2s)]
*  all these multimillionaires and billionaires in the cabinet, not to mention in the administration. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=419.16s)]
*  There's something like 13 billionaires in this administration. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=424.04s)]
*  Yeah, and I always say whenever people seek out positions of power or say things like, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=426.6s)]
*  I'm qualified for this very, very high role, you have to wonder what are their motives behind it, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=431.64s)]
*  right? Why did Dr. Oz want to be a senator? Why is he now accepting a role in Trump's cabinet? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=436.84s)]
*  And yeah, thank you for pointing that out, Michael, because Dr. Oz, everybody knows who he is and what [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=443.56s)]
*  he's about, but maybe people have forgotten by now that he was quite the charlatan when he was on his [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  show, when he had his Dr. Oz show. He was backed by Oprah, another billionaire. So he was never [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=452.84s)]
*  in it for the people. He was doing it for his sponsors, and because now he has all this money. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=458.03999999999996s)]
*  So that is Dr. Oz. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=462.36s)]
*  And the administrator of Medicare and Medicare, in my opinion, should be someone that none of us [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=464.12s)]
*  can name, that none of us have ever heard of. And I think when you are Donald Trump and you see [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  another reality show star, which is what Oz is to a degree, that's what you're attracted to. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, he should stick to telling us that there's arsenic in organic apple juice to boost ratings. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=481.24s)]
*  That's what he does best. I mean, it's ridiculous. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=488.28s)]
*  I mean, we do have a Fox News host who is heading up the Department of Defense. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=492.28s)]
*  So you want to talk about DEI, you want to talk about meritocracy. That's not what we have here. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=496.2s)]
*  And these are just loyalists. This is just an oligarchy. So well, on Thursday, Trump, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  he did press Senate Republicans to find ways to cut the Medicare budget, specifically to pay for [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=506.67999999999995s)]
*  his tax cuts, as we've already discussed, among other things. GOP whip John Barrasso was in the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=512.1999999999999s)]
*  meeting with Trump and other Senate Republicans who are on the Finance Committee. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=518.2s)]
*  And he had this to say, he said, the President wants to make sure that we do eliminate waste, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=522.44s)]
*  fraud, abuse. And there are a number of scams going on right now with Medicaid. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=528.36s)]
*  There is money laundering being done with regard to Medicaid and the American taxpayers [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=534.36s)]
*  shouldn't have to pay for that. My God, okay, the story is still developing. So maybe we'll [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=538.84s)]
*  have more on it later on next week on a different show. But my God, the fraud, the scams, the money [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=544.68s)]
*  laundering, show us the proof. They don't have any proof of this. They have never given us any kind [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  of proof of it. They have people who are making up different definitions of what scams and fraud, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=557.2399999999999s)]
*  fraudulent spending are on Twitter or X now, just so they can defend the moves of this Trump [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=563.7199999999999s)]
*  administration and doge. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=570.2800000000001s)]
*  But really, we have not seen any proof that there is fraudulent spending happening there. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=571.48s)]
*  Okay. There's never proof. There aren't rapists coming up from Mexico. As we were talking about [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=576.44s)]
*  in the last segment, this fake news and this cabal of media that come together, like CBS, NBC, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=585.88s)]
*  and ABC have a conference call every day to talk about what they're gonna say about Donald Trump [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=592.36s)]
*  that day, the way he paints it. No, it's always fiction. Even talking about fentanyl coming over [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=596.92s)]
*  for the northern border, right? What did he talk about? There were like 40 cases. I shouldn't even [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=602.36s)]
*  say because I don't know the exact number, but it was a minuscule amount of fentanyl. But he was [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=608.8399999999999s)]
*  talking about the northern border and he makes things up that will, I mean, they're totally [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=613.0s)]
*  fabulous. And he makes them up to make people think, my God, this guy is falling all the time [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=620.2s)]
*  on every issue. Yeah, they're eating the pets. They're eating the cats. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=626.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. That's right, Sharon. Yeah, no question. Yeah. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  If you wanna know, maybe not a scam, but I believe the federal judge called what the Trump [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=633.88s)]
*  administration was doing with all the firings, the federal employees, a sham. Okay, this is just what [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=637.8000000000001s)]
*  he does. And again, that word that Michael mentioned in the first segment, chaos. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=645.48s)]
*  Let's just go with chaos. And it's so many lies, rapid fire, things you can't even anticipate. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=650.36s)]
*  When someone's charged with a crime, I think you can anticipate perhaps what the defense would be. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=656.84s)]
*  With Trump, he just blurt out things like cats and dogs. And I don't know how you can even defend [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=663.4s)]
*  from it. No one is that fast that they can fact check, get it out before chaos ensues. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=668.92s)]
*  Yeah, I remember, I'm usually not surprised by things with that cat and dog thing. I remember [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=675.16s)]
*  I was sitting watching it with my husband and my jaw was on the ground, so. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4ywwzhEHc&t=680.76s)]
