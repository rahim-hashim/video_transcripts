"US senator Bernie Sanders became one of Coachella's top cameos so far, drawing a massive crowd on Saturday as he made a pit stop at the premier music festival.

Screaming fans sprinted over, camera phones in hand, to capture the politician's unannounced speech that followed a blockbuster set from superstar Charli XCX at a neighboring stage."

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Here's How The Crowd At Coachella Reacted When Bernie Walked On Stage
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c)
*  Please give it up for Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=10.0s)]
*  This weekend Coachella attendees got a surprise visit not from Tupac's hologram again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  It was none other than Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  And that was Representative Maxwell Frost on stage alongside with him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=25.28s)]
*  We're about to show you what Bernie had to say. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=29.5s)]
*  But first, Cenk, Bernie Sanders on the Coachella lineup, what do you think? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=31.58s)]
*  Love it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=37.06s)]
*  That's what you're supposed to do. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=38.22s)]
*  You're not supposed to hide behind binders. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=39.3s)]
*  You're supposed to go out there and try to make your case. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  What I was curious about when I saw the headline was how was he received? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=43.78s)]
*  Because I hear that a lot of the young are now watching right wing media and have all [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=48.14s)]
*  become right wingers. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=53.92s)]
*  Well let's find out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=55.86s)]
*  Well yeah, that was certainly what was on everybody's mind. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=57.7s)]
*  Bernie followed a set by Charlie XCX, super hot artist. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=60.540000000000006s)]
*  You don't expect Bernie coming out there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=66.22s)]
*  He was the introduction for Claro who Bernie thanked for letting him speak. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=68.18s)]
*  And here's a little bit of Bernie's speech and you'll hear the crowd reaction. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=72.58s)]
*  This country faces some very difficult challenges. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=76.7s)]
*  And the future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=86.06s)]
*  Now you can turn away and you can ignore what goes on. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=96.30000000000001s)]
*  But if you do that, you do it in your own peril. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=100.98s)]
*  We need you to stand up to fight for justice. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=104.86s)]
*  To fight for economic justice, social justice, and racial justice. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=109.14s)]
*  Now we got a president of the United States. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=122.18s)]
*  I agree. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=127.82s)]
*  I agree. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=131.82s)]
*  That was Bernie Sanders at Coachella right there wearing his hot girl summer festival [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=135.9s)]
*  sexiest. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=141.1s)]
*  His same outfit and hair as always you gotta at least hand it to him for keeping it real. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=142.66s)]
*  You heard somebody shout fight the oligarchy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=148.1s)]
*  You heard Trump get booze and him saying he agrees the crowd was on his side. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=150.48s)]
*  Here's a little bit more of his drop in Coachella set. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=154.38s)]
*  We have an economy today that is working very well for the billionaire class, but not for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=157.86s)]
*  working families. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=167.82s)]
*  We need you to help us to create an economy that works well for everybody, not just the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=168.82s)]
*  1%. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=179.82s)]
*  We have a healthcare system that is broken. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  We are the only major country not to guarantee healthcare to all people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  We need you to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies and understand that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  healthcare is a human right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=202.9s)]
*  You also got to hand it to Bernie for going with the tried and true crowd pleasers. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=209.66s)]
*  You probably would have lost the largely not sober crowd if you then went and we have to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  work on the earned income tax credit and make sure that the marginal tax rate is somehow [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=218.66s)]
*  instituted in the way to offset these very irresponsible tariffs that are punishing islands [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=224.18s)]
*  with just penguin inhabitant. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=229.74s)]
*  Feel would have been like that is weird, but he did not. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  He kept with the crowd pleasers. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=234.78s)]
*  He also told the audience to fight for women's rights, fight the fossil fuel industry, ended [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=236.5s)]
*  his speech by thanking Clara for using her prominence as a public figure to fight for [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=241.22s)]
*  women's rights as well and to call for an end to the war in Gaza among other things. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=245.7s)]
*  So well received Bernie legendary moment. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=250.58s)]
*  Yeah, that was a great moment. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=254.82s)]
*  So Burning Man meets Coachella in a sense. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=257.1s)]
*  So at least Burning Man. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=261.1s)]
*  So first of all, I get it look it's Coachella. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=263.18s)]
*  It's less likely to be a right wing crowd. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=266.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=268.5s)]
*  He's not speaking stagecoach that is true. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=269.5s)]
*  But I the most important part of this is that Bernie is the one guy in the Democratic Party [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=273.22s)]
*  who understands you got to meet people where they are right and he's not afraid of media. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=278.1s)]
*  He's not afraid of events. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=282.7s)]
*  He's not afraid of who knows man you go to a good thing like Coachella you get booed [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=284.3s)]
*  right but he's not afraid of it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=288.38s)]
*  Because he's genuine and why does the crowd like him so much? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=291.26s)]
*  Yeah, they like that message and that's a good message and that's why most of the young [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=293.94s)]
*  are still very progressive. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=298.14s)]
*  But more than that, they know he's the one honest guy in politics and they know he's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=300.21999999999997s)]
*  been saying this all throughout and they trust him. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=303.82s)]
*  So he's not a regular politician. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  He's not smarmy, he's not fake, he's not plastic. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=309.38s)]
*  If like a regular politician got out there, even if he was a Democrat, I think he would [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  have gotten booed, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=315.41999999999996s)]
*  But Bernie they love that he showed up. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=318.02s)]
*  And that's that almost like now I'm going to overhype it, right? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=319.92s)]
*  But it felt a little bit like a seminal moment like Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=323.16s)]
*  Okay, yeah, yeah, way overhyping, right? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=329.72s)]
*  And it's apples and oranges because that was about music and this is about politics. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  But there's something magical about that crossover when we go on to an entertainment or a pop [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  culture or social arena and make our case like normal human beings. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  And so and by the way, credit to the right wing because they did go on shows, not Coachella, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=352.26s)]
*  but to shows that are more entertainment focused and comedy shows, etc. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  And the Democrats were worried about it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, what will the consultants think? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=363.64s)]
*  How will our talking points work? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's the great thing about Bernie, he doesn't give a goddamn about the talking [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=366.92s)]
*  points. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=369.76s)]
*  He's just going to go and tell them, we got to get you guys better health insurance. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=370.76s)]
*  We got to get you universal healthcare. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=374.52s)]
*  Because that's what he genuinely believes. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=376.44s)]
*  And that's why that crowd reacts so well to it because they know it's genuine. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=378.44s)]
*  Totally true. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=382.24s)]
*  Not at all like Hendrix at Woodstock, but yes, it was more like, I don't know, men at [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=383.28s)]
*  work reunion tour, making a pop in. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=390.36s)]
*  It's like Colin Hay or something. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=394.0s)]
*  But it was a really cool moment for sure. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=396.12s)]
*  And I agree people do think that Bernie is genuine. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=398.18s)]
*  He is genuine. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=400.64s)]
*  He's not slick and doesn't do the political handshaking you expect. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=401.64s)]
*  I know firsthand when I was running for office and I went up to him unannounced at an event [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  we were both speaking at in Iowa for the AFL-CIO. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=409.52s)]
*  I went up and shook his hand and he was like, excuse me, I have to go. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=412.35999999999996s)]
*  And they said, who was that guy? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=416.0s)]
*  I don't know, I don't care. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=417.0s)]
*  That's not the way to play it as a politician. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=418.55999999999995s)]
*  You shake hands, you smile, and then you say who the hell was that guy? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  That's not Bernie. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=424.64s)]
*  He doesn't suffer people when he doesn't want to. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=425.64s)]
*  And if he's there for a reason, he can do it well. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=427.55999999999995s)]
*  He classically did that when he was running for president, that interview with Cardi B, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  that conversation that they did together, which was really cool as well. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=433.6s)]
*  He doesn't need to get dandruff shampoo, it's a side point. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=436.24s)]
*  He's always got some dandruff popping there on the shoulder. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  No, it's genuine. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=440.48s)]
*  I guess. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=441.48s)]
*  He's got genuine dandruff and he's not afraid to highlight it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=442.48s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he's not at all slick in those ways and that is true. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=446.48s)]
*  I can't imagine Donald Trump in that scenario. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  Could you imagine he goes out there? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  It would have been. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=456.68s)]
*  Well, no, I could imagine it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=457.68s)]
*  And I could imagine him getting booed and I can imagine him saying something incredibly [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=459.52s)]
*  silly, right? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  What I can't imagine is Joe Biden, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=465.76s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, if we're being honest, or Ted Cruz, like Mitch McConnell. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=471.84s)]
*  Facts and all that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  I could picture Joe Biden attending the festival lost trying to find the bathrooms. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=480.03999999999996s)]
*  Where's the bathroom? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=485.84s)]
*  Someone told me there's near the hot dog stand, folks. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm not joking around. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=491.44s)]
*  Listen here, Jack. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=493.68s)]
*  Joking around, folks. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=494.32s)]
*  Listen, Jack. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=495.59999999999997s)]

*  Am I just talking to an art installation of a dog-faced pony soldier? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=498.96s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  Not kidding around. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=502.96s)]
*  And listen, I came to Woodstock for a reason. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=505.12s)]
*  I'm hip. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=509.12s)]
*  What are you here to celebrate? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=510.24s)]
*  To dance with the mamas and the papas? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=511.36s)]
*  Okay, I think that's all we got on Biden. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=515.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=517.68s)]

*  Okay, all right. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=524.88s)]
*  I got time for to read one comment for you guys and I wanted to address this one. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=526.16s)]
*  So I'm glad we have time for it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=530.4s)]
*  James Simmons-Rodin on YouTube member section. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  How many more steps are there before it becomes a constitutional crisis when he's literally [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=535.28s)]
*  ignoring the Supreme Court ruling from the other day? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=539.12s)]
*  Help me understand this, please, Cenk. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=541.52s)]
*  So yeah, look, I've seen a couple of friends over the weekend and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=543.68s)]
*  they're talking about people they know doom-scrolling, right? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=547.68s)]
*  And there's this person we know, a family friend, who's worried, she's an American citizen. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=551.3599999999999s)]
*  She's worried that Trump's gonna grab her and deport her. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=558.7199999999999s)]
*  Guys, please, please, one thing at a time, okay? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  So no, for the moment being, he's not grabbing American citizens and deporting them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=566.16s)]
*  Is it scary that he's saying shit like, yeah, let's get the home groans, right? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=570.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's scary, I get it, right? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  But don't panic, panic doesn't help, right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=579.76s)]
*  So when does he actually cross the Rubicon? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=582.16s)]
*  So he's been dancing around the edges of not listening to the courts for a bunch of times. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=585.68s)]
*  There are planes in the air, the court tells him to bring it back and he doesn't, right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=590.0s)]
*  But the next time he still goes into court, still makes an argument, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=594.16s)]
*  etc., and then eventually kind of halfway listens, right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=597.76s)]
*  And he's doing this dance and he's testing the waters, right? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  So it's super dangerous times. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=605.3599999999999s)]
*  But the Rubicon is crossed when the Supreme Court says, in this case, they said facilitate [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=607.6s)]
*  a return and they told to go back to the lower courts to figure out how, right? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=613.44s)]
*  So when Stephen Miller is pretending that they won the Supreme Court case, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=619.6s)]
*  when in fact they lost it, that's terrible, awful. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=624.16s)]
*  You heard us criticize the hell out of it, etc. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  But that doesn't cross the Rubicon yet. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=631.9200000000001s)]
*  If the Supreme Court says, okay, that's it, we went through the whole process, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=634.64s)]
*  Garcia, bring him back right now or do X or do Y, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=639.44s)]
*  And he goes, no, I'm just not gonna do it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=644.64s)]
*  We have a final ruling and I'm not doing it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  That's crossing the Rubicon. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=650.08s)]
*  So at that point, when the president stops listening to the courts, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=651.76s)]
*  I mean, normally what would happen is you should get impeached immediately, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=657.2s)]
*  But the Republicans control the House. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  Are they really gonna impeach him? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=664.96s)]
*  If he doesn't listen to the Supreme Court, especially when they're unanimous with [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=667.2s)]
*  Clarice Thomas and Alito and all those guys, maybe you peel off two or three Republicans, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=670.32s)]
*  maybe get him impeached. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=676.0s)]
*  But what difference does it make? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=676.96s)]
*  It's gonna go to the Senate. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=678.0s)]
*  Are the Republicans really going to convict him and throw him out of office? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=679.2800000000001s)]
*  That seems impossible. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=684.0s)]
*  But then what does he do? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=685.5200000000001s)]
*  So that's the moment where, things have gone a hell of a hand basket. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=687.6s)]
*  And then we gotta figure out, yeah, now how do we respond [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=694.72s)]
*  in a way that doesn't make this situation devolve? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=697.92s)]
*  So we're not there yet, but he keeps testing, he keeps testing these nonstop trial balloons, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=702.4s)]
*  right? And guys, why am I working so hard and at great personal expense that [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  the, all of these folks attacking us, etc, etc, and hurting us? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=715.12s)]
*  Why am I doing all that? Because the only thing he's going to actually listen to is his voters. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=721.04s)]
*  So if you can't swing his voters and he doesn't drop to 20% in polling, he doesn't drop to the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=727.52s)]
*  teens, etc, in polling. He doesn't get some, he becomes intensely unpopular. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  He loves being unpopular with the left. That's not gonna do anything. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=741.12s)]
*  He becomes intensely unpopular with his own voters. Then maybe, that's a way to fight back. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  That's a way to try to swing the momentum. That's the most logical way, right? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=751.52s)]
*  But we gotta think of eight different ways to fight back. But right now panicking and [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=755.9200000000001s)]
*  is not helping you, your psychology, your personal peace of mind, etc. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=761.52s)]
*  But trust me, we've gotta have an organized, and by the way, the Democrats are just, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  if you're relying on them for plans, then we're definitely screwed. So somebody's gotta have to [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=770.8s)]
*  make a plan here and then have our side executed. And that's another thing I'm worried about. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=776.0s)]
*  We're never organized. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=782.4s)]
*  Execute it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=783.5999999999999s)]
*  It. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=784.4s)]
*  Not executed. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=785.5999999999999s)]
*  No. So we're never organized. We never agree. We never unite, right? But we've gotta unite [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=786.7199999999999s)]
*  But we've gotta unite in a way that makes sense. If we unite around, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=795.52s)]
*  okay, now since he's not listening to the courts, we shouldn't listen to the courts, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=799.44s)]
*  or we should break the law. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That'll make it way worse, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=803.2s)]
*  right? You don't want it to devolve. So yeah, there comes a moment we're not at that moment [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=807.36s)]
*  yet. It doesn't mean you should relax and not care. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=812.24s)]
*  Resistance now is super important because you can't let him get there. If you think [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=814.0s)]
*  you can get there, then like you said, it's almost too late. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=817.36s)]
*  Yeah. And so all that is true. But again, when you think of resistance, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=820.0s)]
*  if all you're doing is screaming at him, he loves it. It doesn't hurt him at all, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=824.48s)]
*  right? He gets to even say to his guys, to his MAGA base, etc. Haha, look, we own the lips, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=828.72s)]
*  right? And so they seem to care a little bit less about that these days. I know, again, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=836.72s)]
*  everybody will be skeptical. But I haven't heard that phraseology in a while, right? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=841.28s)]
*  Yeah. And it makes sense. Once you win a second time, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=845.28s)]
*  you already own anybody you needed to own, right? Can you now actually govern, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=849.12s)]
*  right? Can you actually do something for the average American? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=854.08s)]
*  And one of the things we should be pounding home all the time is, what has he done for you? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=856.64s)]
*  Has he actually done anything, right? So he did a good job with getting the border under [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=860.72s)]
*  control and then mangled it with, I'm going to take innocent people and send them to El Salvador. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=864.88s)]
*  So just remember, he's going to pass tax cuts for the rich. He's already cutting social security [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=870.5600000000001s)]
*  offices. They're having an argument about cutting $800 billion from Medicaid. These are very popular [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=877.2800000000001s)]
*  things, Medicaid, social security. If we are the protectors of those things, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=882.96s)]
*  we will win over a much larger portion of the American population. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=886.88s)]
*  And then we could ask that larger percentage, hey, can you work with us to make sure we get [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=890.96s)]
*  back to the Constitution and back to what this country is supposed to be? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=897.84s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. That's the question I think Bill [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=900.96s)]
*  Maher really missed in his interview with Steve Bannon the other day. Like Maher, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=905.12s)]
*  I think he so often has a great moment and he comes close to like, but he wants to be, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=910.08s)]
*  I think, liked so much in these interviews that he doesn't go for the kill. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=914.72s)]
*  And so when he said to him, you're the one that brought up a third term for Trump [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=918.24s)]
*  and him flouting the Constitution, and he says, let me read you from the Constitution. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=922.4000000000001s)]
*  He reads the one sentence that says no man can have a second, more than two terms elected to [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  office as president. And he goes, you should have this, gives it to him to keep. And he goes, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=930.96s)]
*  but I guarantee you where he's going to run for a third time. And then Maher just goes, well, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=934.96s)]
*  you saw the Constitution I just read to you. He lets it not advance to the important question of, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=939.6s)]
*  but why? If you claim you care about the Constitution, then why are you saying that? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=946.4s)]
*  You right now are admitting to the MAGA base that you actually do not care about the Constitution. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  And if Trump runs a third time, you're admitting that he doesn't either. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=958.72s)]
*  You have to make them understand it in those chunks and not going to that final step is [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=961.76s)]
*  really a missed opportunity. Let alone not asking Bannon why he did a Nazi salute as well [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=965.92s)]
*  at the end of his speech. Yeah. So look, you guys voted to [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=972.7199999999999s)]
*  overwhelmingly that we should have Bannon on. Let me go try to do that because we would ask [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=976.88s)]
*  that question and we will ask that question. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=980.64s)]
*  a swings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrp6_tkd5c&t=984.8s)]
