"Unionized American garment workers produced the most beautiful and well-made garments back in the day. They took pride in their work and it was well deserved. Women today pay top dollar and go out of their way to buy vintage clothes made in the 50s-60s. I don‚Äôt get what the message is supposed to be with a video like this? This work isn‚Äôt beneath anyone. Critiquing tariffs shouldn‚Äôt devolve into looking down our noses at workers."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Liberals Share DEGRADING Video About American Workers
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8)
* ussian music [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, so look, this is apparently [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=30.0s)]
*  meant to make fun of Americans and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=33.08s)]
*  Trump's like tariff policies, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=35.88s)]
*  which is already insane since [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=38.4s)]
*  they're like kind of showing [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=40.68s)]
*  the terrible conditions that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=42.88s)]
*  Chinese people and also people in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=45.04s)]
*  other countries that our [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  corporations exploit for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=49.32s)]
*  cheap labor working under. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  That's happening now in some [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=53.08s)]
*  countries that we do trade with. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=54.44s)]
*  So let me just put that out there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=56.08s)]
*  The other thing that really stood [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=57.56s)]
*  out is that it was a post on TikTok, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=59.04s)]
*  it's an AI generated video. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=62.32s)]
*  Then someone posted it on X, and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=65.8s)]
*  all of these self-described [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=68.16s)]
*  progressives and liberals are [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=70.24s)]
*  sharing it and looking down their [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=72.36s)]
*  noses at it, it's funny? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=74.68s)]
*  Why is that funny? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=76.88s)]
*  Honestly, I don't get the whole [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=78.72s)]
*  thing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=79.88s)]
*  That's why we did a poll in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=80.4s)]
*  the live chat. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=81.48s)]
*  What are your thoughts on this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=82.28s)]
*  video? Love it, hate it, confused [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=83.48s)]
*  by it, which I think I'm going to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  vote on or neutral, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=86.52s)]
*  And so I guess what they're saying [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=88.8s)]
*  is if Trump's tariff policy were [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=91.24s)]
*  to work anyway, well, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  we would do these menial jobs. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=94.84s)]
*  Americans aren't going to do these [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=96.96s)]
*  menial jobs, so ha ha, who cares? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=99.2s)]
*  But that's not a great own of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=101.52s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=103.88s)]
*  Remember, progressives, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=105.32s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, etc, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=107.28s)]
*  were in favor of tariffs. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=108.92s)]
*  Not crazy tariffs like Trump, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=111.2s)]
*  not these mega nuclear tariffs, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=112.96s)]
*  but tariffs to protect some parts [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=114.88s)]
*  of the manufacturing industry. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=116.84s)]
*  Why are we making fun of American [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=118.76s)]
*  manufacturing by making it seem [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=120.68s)]
*  like we'd be Chinese workers in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  sweatshops? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=124.28s)]
*  That we would be working in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=125.0s)]
*  sweatshops, yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=126.28s)]
*  First of all, so you're okay with [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=127.28s)]
*  the sweatshops, us exploiting [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  the sweatshops in other countries, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=131.08s)]
*  we're okay with that as long as [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=133.0s)]
*  it's not Americans? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=134.68s)]
*  First of all, no one should be [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  working in sweatshops, period. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=137.32s)]
*  And by the way, we actually used to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=138.84s)]
*  have unionized textile and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=140.76s)]
*  garment workers here in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=142.44s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=143.88s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=145.16s)]
*  They took a lot of pride in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=145.72s)]
*  the work they did. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=147.08s)]
*  Because this is actually [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  skilled labor. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  If you're under the assumption [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  that someone who's a seamstress, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  someone who sews clothing for [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=153.92s)]
*  a living is not a skilled worker, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=155.44s)]
*  you're mistaken. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=157.16s)]
*  Yes, I understand that they now [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=158.56s)]
*  have sewing machines that are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  literally automatic, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  they're computerized and automatic. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=161.92s)]
*  But nonetheless, there is actually [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=163.88s)]
*  a lot of skill that goes into it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=165.6s)]
*  And I want to remind you all, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=167.12s)]
*  again, well paying unionized jobs [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=168.88s)]
*  back in the day in America. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  So are they under the assumption [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=172.72s)]
*  that with labor laws that we have [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=174.48s)]
*  here, if those jobs came back to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=176.28s)]
*  the United States, Americans will [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=178.04s)]
*  be working in sweatshops. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=180.16s)]
*  How is that an own of Trump? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=182.0s)]
*  So if you said his tariffs are [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  maniacal, you're correct. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=186.48s)]
*  Like, hey, that's going to lead to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  higher prices, you're correct. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=190.92s)]
*  If you're saying we shouldn't [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  protect jobs here in America, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=194.88s)]
*  A, you're not correct, B, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  that is definitely not [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  a progressive position. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=199.44s)]
*  And it feels a tiny bit like- [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=201.28s)]
*  Alenist? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=202.92s)]
*  When Republicans make fun of AOC for [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=203.64s)]
*  earlier being a barker, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  being a bartender. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=207.6s)]
*  Yeah, why don't you go back to be [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=209.04s)]
*  a bartender? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=210.48s)]
*  Yeah, so what? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=211.04s)]
*  I'm proud that she was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=212.16s)]
*  a bartender. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  Same. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=213.52s)]
*  And so I just don't get it and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=214.08s)]
*  I don't think it's funny. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  And I'm not sure what the big [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=217.2s)]
*  own is. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=218.4s)]
*  I just want, please, for once, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=219.08s)]
*  I just want progressives online and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=222.2s)]
*  Democrats in general to not take [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=225.44s)]
*  the bait, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=228.4s)]
*  So if Trump does something, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=230.28s)]
*  make an argument, a hollow [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  argument, because I don't believe [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=233.36s)]
*  him for a second, that he wants to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=235.12s)]
*  have tariffs to bring [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=236.68s)]
*  manufacturing jobs back to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=237.68s)]
*  the United States. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=238.96s)]
*  That doesn't mean you need to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=239.84s)]
*  automatically be against [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=241.16s)]
*  manufacturing jobs or [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqIt7EmJI8&t=242.4s)]
