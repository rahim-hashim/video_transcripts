TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Getting YOUR Social Security Benefits Just Got WAY MORE DIFFICULT
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM)
*  Starting March 31st, social security recipients will no longer be able to verify their identity [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=0.0s)]
*  via the telephone. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=5.92s)]
*  And if they can't figure out how to do it with the agency's My Social Security Online [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=7.44s)]
*  service or don't have good internet access, they'll have to come in person to an agency [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=11.18s)]
*  field office. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=15.76s)]
*  This will be the policy for new social security applicants and existing recipients if they [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=17.38s)]
*  want to change where their direct deposit goes to. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=22.64s)]
*  Retiree advocates warn that the change will negatively impact older Americans in rural [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=26.4s)]
*  areas, including those with disabilities, mobility limitations, those who live far from [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  SSA offices, and those who have limited internet access. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=36.8s)]
*  Well, at least the powerful in this country have not lost their connection to the average [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=40.92s)]
*  person. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=46.08s)]
*  For example, speaking on the issue of social security payments and possible delays, here [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=47.32s)]
*  is global financial service firm Cantor Fitzgerald, chairman and CEO Howard Letnick, who also [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=53.08s)]
*  is chairman and CEO of BGC Partners, a brokerage and technology company, and Trump's commerce [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=58.56s)]
*  secretary speaking about these changes in a super relatable way. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=65.48s)]
*  Let's say social security didn't send out their checks this month. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=70.48s)]
*  My mother-in-law, who's 94, she wouldn't call and complain. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=76.36s)]
*  She just wouldn't. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=81.52s)]
*  She thinks something got messed up and she'll get it next month. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=82.6s)]
*  A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling, and complaining. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=86.24s)]
*  Yes, fraudsters always make the loudest noise, but also people who rely on food to eat, rely [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=94.16s)]
*  on money to buy food to be able to survive. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so stupid is exactly right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=106.44s)]
*  How out of touch and unbelievable. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=108.58s)]
*  The great sample size of his mother, who wouldn't complain because she's the mother of a very [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=110.92s)]
*  wealthy man who's also the commerce secretary of the United States. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=117.7s)]
*  Well, to be fair, mother-in-law, Ben, the arrogance is astounding. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=121.04s)]
*  As you say, there's so much money in that family. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  Making any reference to your family, sir, is a real mistake. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=133.56s)]
*  But you see the arrogance and the pomposity. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=137.12s)]
*  It's just all wrapped up in these people. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=139.84s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=141.52s)]
*  And by the way, just the way you introduced him, I love that you introduced him this way [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=142.52s)]
*  because it speaks to this wealth management that he does. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  And there's no divestiture in this crew. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=150.68s)]
*  They retain connections to all of their investments, just the way they did in the first Donald [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  Trump term. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=158.88s)]
*  It's really antithetical to everything that's American. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=160.72s)]
*  Totally, and before we continue with our commentary, let me just share a couple more details. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=164.12s)]
*  It's not just the phone service that they're shutting down the ability to verify your identity. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=168.48s)]
*  The plan also comes as the agency plans to shutter dozens of social security offices [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=173.32s)]
*  throughout the country and has already laid out plans to lay off thousands of workers. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=178.54s)]
*  Leland Dudek, the Duder himself, the agency's acting commissioner, said part of the issue [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  with getting rid of fraudulent claims is, quote, the information that we use through [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=189.76s)]
*  knowledge-based authentication is already in the public domain and says this is a common [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=194.66s)]
*  sense measure, according to Dudek. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=200.66s)]
*  But common sense sometimes is not at the ready when you don't realize the real world consequences [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  of needing to put more hurdles in the way of people who already have a hard time staying [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=211.82s)]
*  afloat in this country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=217.34s)]
*  Seventy two point five million Americans, including retirees and children, receive retirement [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=218.9s)]
*  and disability benefits through SSA. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=223.7s)]
*  Connecticut rep John Larson, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Social Security [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=226.38s)]
*  Subcommittee said in a statement that, quote, by requiring seniors and disabled Americans [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=231.1s)]
*  to enroll online or in person at the same field offices they are trying to close rather [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=236.45999999999998s)]
*  than over the phone, Trump and Musk are trying to create chaos and inefficiencies at SSA [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=241.62s)]
*  so they can privatize the system. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  That very well may be the actual plan as it unfolds in the months and years to come. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=249.26000000000002s)]
*  Musk has been spouting untrue theories about social security, saying it's full of fraud, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=255.18s)]
*  calling it a Ponzi scheme, suggesting it'll be a major part of his efforts to shrink government [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=259.38s)]
*  spending. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=263.7s)]
*  But for some reason, never on the chopping block is the subsidies going to Musk's companies [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=264.9s)]
*  or even quite the opposite, repeated ads for buying Teslas on the White House lawn. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=269.62s)]
*  Jackson? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=275.62s)]
*  Well, the whole social security is maybe the most popular public program that we have in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=277.5s)]
*  America. And one of the interesting things to me about it is that ever since social security [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=286.14s)]
*  was founded, the Republican Party has been trying to get rid of it. That's been on the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=292.06s)]
*  forefront, if it's not in the background of the Republican agenda, my entire life. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=297.74s)]
*  Ronald Reagan came into office talking about welfare queens. And it's just, if it wasn't for [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=302.62s)]
*  the racism that just continues to sell and sell and sell and sell with the Republican base, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=308.06s)]
*  it's like, y'all keep voting for people whose main goal is to get rid of public programs like [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=313.18s)]
*  this. And it never goes over well with people. Any administration that's in that talks about [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=319.42s)]
*  getting rid of or cutting social security, people don't wanna hear that, people don't want that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=325.42s)]
*  because people need it to survive. And as you pointed out, whoever this dude is, his rich family, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=329.58s)]
*  they don't need social security. So what difference does that make? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=334.38s)]
*  And the most common thing that you hear about social security is just a flat out lie that it's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=338.85999999999996s)]
*  gonna run out of money. There's not gonna be any money left, not true. Most of the money's still [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=344.7s)]
*  gonna be there. And if you wanna fund it more to fill in whatever that 20% is that's missing, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=350.7s)]
*  just raise the cap so that people who make more than, what is it, $175,000 a year, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=357.1s)]
*  and it's 6.2, 6.9% or something like that, raise the cap so that people who make more than that pay [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  the same amount. But they won't do that because they don't want people to have access to stuff [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=369.18s)]
*  like this. Because when people have access to welfare, it's more difficult to subjugate them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=373.66s)]
*  On top of the fact that the super wealthy in this country just don't wanna pay taxes at all. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=380.22s)]
*  But again, it's like y'all keep voting for people who endlessly talk about going after [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=385.66s)]
*  Medicare, Medicaid, taking away the Affordable Care Act. And then when they bring it to the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=391.82000000000005s)]
*  forefront, they're like, keep your government hands off my Medicare. But y'all so racist that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=397.02000000000004s)]
*  you can't stop voting for these people. So it's just an endless loop. Hopefully, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=402.38s)]
*  we can do something about it with the younger generations. But it's just ridiculous to watch. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  And also, I believe you can actually close the shortfall by just raising the cap on people [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=413.02s)]
*  making like over $2 million a year. And you can do it that way as well. And so it's not even [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=417.82s)]
*  gonna affect most people, Mark. Well, yeah, I mean, raising the cap is the solution and it [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  can be done easily. And you're right, it can be done high end. It can be done, just raising it [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=427.5s)]
*  from the 175 that it is now up just modestly. So yeah, I mean, you could have Social Security [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=431.02s)]
*  rolling in money if you raise the cap a little bit further. And it wouldn't even matter to the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=437.5s)]
*  people to whom it would be most affected by whatever new legislation. You're also so right [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=441.1s)]
*  on, Jackson, 100%. They've been talking about this since the very beginning. It's taken on [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=445.90000000000003s)]
*  so many different forms. George Bush, the younger George Bush, I think most recently talked about, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=450.3s)]
*  you want control over that money that you pay into the government. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=456.06s)]
*  And yet, obviously, that was kind of DOA because they realized, I think that the word got out, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=459.26000000000005s)]
*  that this was the beginning of privatization. But the plan for everything, the plan for it all, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  is privatization. They want to privatize Social Security, the post office, everything. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=471.1s)]
*  I mean, it goes well beyond the military. I mean, Eric Prince is already a part of this Trump [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=475.18s)]
*  administration connected. He had Blackwater and all of Iraq back a few years back. So I think that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=480.14000000000004s)]
*  is the plan. The one thing I would say is this Social Security, because it is, it used to be [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=486.70000000000005s)]
*  anyway, the third rail of American politics that is just sort of a radioactive thing you didn't [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=492.70000000000005s)]
*  want to mention. They brought it up very early, and Musk has brought it up way earlier than expected. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=496.38s)]
*  Russell Vogt, the primary author of Project 2025, he talks about getting to Social Security, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=503.1s)]
*  but he talks about getting to it way down the line. He didn't want it mentioned. The dismantling of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=509.34s)]
*  government is supposed to affect things that don't really hit average Americans right away. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFIqktfcYM&t=515.74s)]
