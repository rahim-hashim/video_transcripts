The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump BREAKS Massive Campaign Promise
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig)
*  The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=6.12s)]
*  other weapons on the site. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=11.36s)]
*  Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=13.68s)]
*  development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=19.42s)]
*  area. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=25.82s)]
*  The people of the area means Israelis who will now steal the Gaza Strip, steal that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=27.82s)]
*  land and build settlements there that the United States will, I guess, pay for and facilitate. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  Today President Donald Trump stated that the US will take over and own the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=39.9s)]
*  And not only that, the US will clean it out too. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=45.18s)]
*  What Trump didn't say but is obviously implied is that we are cleaning it out on behalf of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=55.7s)]
*  And you can tell by the smirk on Benjamin Netanyahu's face in that video that he is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=56.7s)]
*  very pleased with what his servant is willing to do. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=60.82s)]
*  Yeah, take him around the park, BB, okay? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  Make sure he gets all the barking out of him and of course you won't clean his mess. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=71.14s)]
*  Okay, so it turns out Trump's an even bigger dog of Netanyahu than Joe Biden was. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=76.7s)]
*  And that was a hard bar, man, that was a high bar because Joe Biden loved to do whatever [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=82.7s)]
*  Netanyahu ordered him to do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=87.38s)]
*  Now this is more, but look, let's say, okay, so two different things here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  Number one, he says we're gonna own it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=92.34s)]
*  Like what? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=95.46s)]
*  Like you're saying that to get Maggie riled up, like yeah, man, we're gonna take Greenland, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=96.46s)]
*  we're gonna take Panama Canal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  And we're gonna take- [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  No, we're not owning it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on though. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  Are we though? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  Are we going to own it? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  Because is it gonna be like Puerto Rico? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  And then we subsidize, etc, etc, and Gaza's a territory of ours. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=107.38s)]
*  Are they gonna be the 54th state? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  No, I'll tell you right now, and if you're MAGA, if you're not a knucklehead, you already [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=115.14s)]
*  know this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=118.58s)]
*  No, that means we don't own it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=119.58s)]
*  That means we have to spend all the money cleaning up Israel's mess. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=121.86s)]
*  And now the most important point, anti-war, anti-war, boots on the ground. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=126.5s)]
*  Yeah, let me get to that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=130.66s)]
*  Boots, yes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=131.66s)]
*  Trump also stated that the Gaza Strip should not be rebuilt, and he called it occupied. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=133.06s)]
*  Occupied by the same people who originally lived there, meaning the Palestinians. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=139.9s)]
*  Trump said that the Palestinians should go to other countries, and those other countries [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=144.22s)]
*  would allegedly pay for the reconstruction of new homes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=148.5s)]
*  So he wants to push Palestinians into Egypt, into Jordan, and then Egypt and Jordan will [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=153.88s)]
*  just pick up the tab of building new homes that Palestinian refugees would be living [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  in. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  Trump even suggested that US troops could be sent to Gaza. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  He stated that the US would have a long-term ownership position in the area. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  And when asked who would live in Gaza after the Palestinians are pushed out of their own [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=176.14s)]
*  land, Trump gave a pretty vague answer about the world's people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=180.98s)]
*  Let's take a look at those comments. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, given what you've said about Gaza, did the US send troops to help secure [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=189.86s)]
*  the security back in? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=194.58s)]
*  As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  If it's necessary, we'll do that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=200.5s)]
*  We're gonna take over that piece, we're gonna develop it, create thousands and thousands [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=202.62s)]
*  of jobs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  And it'll be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=209.22000000000003s)]
*  You're talking tonight about the United States taking over a sovereign territory. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=212.3s)]
*  What authority would allow you to do that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  Are you talking about a permanent occupation there? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=219.3s)]
*  I do see a long-term ownership position and I see it bringing great stability to that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=222.22s)]
*  part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=229.10000000000002s)]
*  How do you envision living there? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=231.9s)]
*  I envision the world, people living there, the world's people. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=234.5s)]
*  I think you'll make that into an international, unbelievable place. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=239.78s)]
*  I think the potential and the Gaza Strip is unbelievable. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=244.82s)]
*  It's going to be for Israeli settlers who have been eyeing the Gaza Strip since the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  beginning of this war. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=255.5s)]
*  That is who will live there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=257.14s)]
*  The United States is gonna probably help clean and reconstruct the Gaza Strip on behalf of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=258.54s)]
*  the Israeli people. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  This is my prediction, but I have reason to believe that this is gonna be the outcome. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=265.53999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no, there's no question about it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  When he says the world's people, what he's saying is we're gonna redevelop Gaza just [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=270.66s)]
*  like my son-in-law Jared Kushner said well over a year ago. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=274.9s)]
*  It's got beautiful water-reformed property. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=278.34s)]
*  Trump also talked about that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=279.94s)]
*  So when Israel runs it, everybody can go and that way the Palestinians can go after we [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=281.56s)]
*  steal their land on behalf of Israel. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=286.98s)]
*  And then we don't own it, we're gonna give it right back to Israel after we spend all [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=289.3s)]
*  the money. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=292.3s)]
*  Plus, we're gonna put new boots on the ground. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=293.3s)]
*  And if you notice in the earlier clip, he said to clean out the bombs that are there. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=294.42s)]
*  We wouldn't want IDF soldiers getting hurt. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=299.02s)]
*  God forbid. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=301.06s)]
*  No, sending Americans to get hurt. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=302.06s)]
*  Yeah, who cares? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=303.29999999999995s)]
*  Cleaning out the bombs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=304.29999999999995s)]
*  They're disposable, right? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=305.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but no, no, no, we're not gonna get involved in the Middle East, Trump said. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=306.29999999999995s)]
*  We're anti-war, Trump said. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=309.58s)]
*  No boots on the ground, Trump said. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, Israel has ordered him to send boots on the ground, clean up their [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=312.94s)]
*  mess, steal the Palestinian land for them. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=318.94s)]
*  And by the way, do you think the 2.2 million Palestinians there are gonna go quietly into [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=321.97999999999996s)]
*  that good night? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  No, the American soldiers will have to start doing the ethnic cleansing and the genocide. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=329.06s)]
*  So Israel can go, I didn't do it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=336.86s)]
*  America did it for me. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=340.02000000000004s)]
*  You see, they're smiling the whole time like, who's your boss? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=342.58000000000004s)]
*  He's smiling at you, Maga. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=347.58000000000004s)]
*  And he's going, who's your boss now? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  Same as before. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=351.66s)]
*  I own Biden and I own Trump. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=352.66s)]
*  Go ahead, little doggy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  Tell him exactly what I told you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=357.41999999999996s)]
*  American guys, you go get blown up by those bombs. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEppAV9ig&t=359.9s)]
