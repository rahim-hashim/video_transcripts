# Trump Tried To Quietly Bring Migrants Back From Gitmo & He's Getting Called Out For It
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk)
*  Then we went back to the detention facility where the illegal aliens are. It's an incredibly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=0.0s)]
*  professional operation. It's as I remember it when I was here. But I think the message is clear. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=6.0s)]
*  If you break the law, if you are a criminal, you can find your way at Guantanamo Bay. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=12.72s)]
*  You don't wanna be at Guantanamo Bay, which is where we house Al Qaeda after 9-11. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=18.56s)]
*  Well, it seems like undocumented immigrants don't really have to worry that much about [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=23.92s)]
*  Guantanamo Bay anymore anyway. Because it turns out that as of last Friday, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=30.480000000000004s)]
*  290 migrants from 27 countries cycled through the base. But now, less than two months after [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=35.52s)]
*  Trump took office, there are absolutely no migrants detained at Gitmo. And it looks like [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=42.96s)]
*  this whole stunt might have been pointless. So much so that even Fox's reporters are calling [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=50.0s)]
*  him out on it. So let's get into the details. In fact, before we get into the details, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=57.2s)]
*  I remember earlier this week was you had just very briefly referenced how Trump is doing with [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=61.84s)]
*  his mass deportation efforts. Do you wanna weigh in on that a little bit before I get to some of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=67.44s)]
*  these details? It's not happening cuz as we said, it was never going to happen in the ways that were [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=72.08s)]
*  promised for various reasons that we could get into. But there was that initial wave of denying [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=78.72s)]
*  people birthright citizenship and sweeping up Chicago and blah, blah, blah. But the bottom line [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=85.52s)]
*  is the business interests of this country are addicted to cheap labor. And so the Republican [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=91.76s)]
*  base's problems with immigration floods, I'm sorry, it's just bucking up against an interest [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=99.44s)]
*  that is more powerful than even the MAGA base. So they haven't given a specific reason as to why [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=107.36s)]
*  this is happening. I wanna be clear about that, but I think your theory is so spot on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=114.32s)]
*  Because the reason why Congress has failed in passing any real comprehensive immigration reform [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=118.8s)]
*  is because their donors don't actually want comprehensive immigration reform. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Having this demographic of laborers that can be exploited, that can be paid even less than minimum [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=129.68s)]
*  wage because what recourse do they have? Of course, the business world wants to continue relying on [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=138.88s)]
*  that. Doing mass deportations is not something that they're interested in. But on top of that, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=142.72s)]
*  guys, let's keep it real. Obviously, it's not a process that is cheap, which is why Congress [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=148.24s)]
*  needs to be involved. The White House can't just unilaterally pick money from trees and then build [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=155.28s)]
*  the infrastructure necessary to actually carry out mass deportations. And so I think that also [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=161.6s)]
*  has something to do with what we're seeing in terms of the numbers, the mismatch in Trump's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=167.04s)]
*  statements and the actual numbers of people who are being deported. So here's what's happening. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=173.2s)]
*  Last January, Trump signed an executive order specifically to instruct the departments of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=178.08s)]
*  defense and homeland security to begin preparing the 30,000-person migrant facility [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=182.88s)]
*  at Guantanamo Bay. When that story came out, we gave you the details. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=190.24s)]
*  But according to the New York Times, the Trump administration just randomly out of nowhere [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=194.48s)]
*  abruptly changed their plans, cleared out a second group of 40 male migrants that they [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=199.2s)]
*  brought to Gitmo and then they returned them to the United States. So Fox producer Liz [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=206.32s)]
*  Frieden says that the migrants were transported back to the US on ICE aircraft. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=212.32s)]
*  The group includes 23 high threat illegal aliens who were held at the detention facility on base [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  and 17 migrants who were held at the migrant operations center on base. So that's what she's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=225.2s)]
*  claiming. We don't know the names of these individuals. I can't cross check what she's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=231.12s)]
*  saying to see if it's accurate. But point is, they were sent to Gitmo, but then they were [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=236.4s)]
*  abruptly sent back to the US. So an anonymous Defense Department official [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  says that the government relocated the men to one or more ICE facilities in Louisiana on Tuesday. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=247.44s)]
*  And this is actually not the first, but the second time the administration has brought people to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  Guantanamo only to turn around and bring them back a few weeks later. So two weeks ago, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=259.04s)]
*  the US Department of Homeland Security sent another group of 48 migrants detained [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  in Gitmo back to the same Louisiana city. Both of the transfers back were on ICE Air. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=270.96s)]
*  ICE Air sounds lovely, but obviously it's not in this context. A less expensive option compared [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=279.76s)]
*  with the 17 military flights that have transported migrants to Guantanamo base since the Trump [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=285.68s)]
*  administration's migrant operation began more than a month ago. So of the other migrants kept at the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  base, those people have already been deported, okay? So some of the folks sent back to the United [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=300.0s)]
*  States, those who remained at Gitmo were then deported to their country of origin. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=308.0s)]
*  So some of the other migrants kept at the base have already been deported. On February 20th, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=314.16s)]
*  the Trump administration deported a group of 177 Venezuelan men, the highest number of migrants [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=320.48s)]
*  detained in Guantanamo under the Trump administration at one time. That's saying [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=326.24s)]
*  something, guys. I mean, 177 people is a lot of people, but that's not mass deportation. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  So they were sent back to their homeland and that was the first time it cleared out its migrant [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=336.56s)]
*  detainee population. Now, Trump had alleged that the detainees were all members of gangs, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  but most of the identities that are known, those folks don't have a criminal record at all. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  So it seems like he might have been fear mongering about those folks. We need actual [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=355.84s)]
*  evidence to confirm what he's saying and we just don't have it. And it's not actually clear why [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=360.96s)]
*  the Trump administration made this abrupt decision to clear out Gitmo. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  And when we originally covered this story was I had shared with the audience that under the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=370.96s)]
*  Clinton administration, Clinton had, I believe it was around 40 to 45,000 undocumented immigrants [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  detained at Guantanamo Bay. They've had this massive detention facility for migrants. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=384.56s)]
*  And it is different from the detention facility where they were torturing Muslim people back [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=391.44s)]
*  during the war on terror. By the way, that facility is still open and still has people [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=396.56s)]
*  who have never been charged with anything detained. But anyway, thoughts on this? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=402.56s)]
*  I think what people gotta understand, the abrupt about face is because it was never a substantive [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=406.96s)]
*  idea or policy. The Gitmo thing was always to get headlines. It was to evoke this image [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=415.12s)]
*  of these dangerous criminal migrant elements. And not only are we gonna deport their asses, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=421.68s)]
*  we're gonna send them the Gitmo where we used to torture Khalid Sheikh Mohammed [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=430.24s)]
*  and the rest of his boys during the war on terror moment. That's the imagery that they were trying [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=435.12s)]
*  to project by even pulling this Gitmo stunt. But maybe, Ana, just maybe Doge got involved in today. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=442.16s)]
*  This is inefficient. We're flying people over, we're flying them back. What are we even doing here? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=450.24s)]
*  Maybe they got the memo that this was stupid. And again, guys, it's important to understand ICE [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  as it exists today does not have the infrastructure nor the function nor the funding, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  excuse me, nor do they have the staff to round up millions of people and then move them out. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  They don't have that capability or capacity. But Donald Trump did run on, if this guy has a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=477.84s)]
*  mandate for anything, I will admit, which I'm dubious of the idea that Trump, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=486.16s)]
*  with his 1.5% electoral victory, has some huge mandate for anything. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  But if he has a mandate for something, things that were polling in like 60 to 65% [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=496.0s)]
*  when he got inaugurated, it is deportation of the migrants. And so he had to pay some level of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=502.16s)]
*  lip service. But as you guys can see, he does not care. They do not care. Trump's not using [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=509.6s)]
*  this bully pulper to be like, yo, we have the House, we have the Senate, let's pass a spending [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=516.08s)]
*  measure to fund the hell out of ICE. Let's get these immigrants out of here. He's not doing [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=521.36s)]
*  any of that. And I think if you were paying attention, you knew this was never gonna happen. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=525.44s)]
*  Well, yeah, but I mean, it's interesting because at a time when Trump and his friends are saying [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=529.76s)]
*  all sorts of scary sounding things that does actually instill fear in people's minds and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=541.12s)]
*  hearts. It's kind of hard to make the point that this is unlikely to happen, right? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=547.28s)]
*  In fact, I kind of tried to make that point and people did not like it. But guys, it's not an [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=552.8s)]
*  easy thing to carry out a mass deportation. He talks about it as if it's simple, as if the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=557.68s)]
*  resources there, as if the necessary infrastructure and logistics are readily available to do a [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=563.2s)]
*  deportation of tens of millions of people. Now, the immigrant detentions on Guantanamo Bay have [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=571.84s)]
*  been such a debacle that even Fox reporter Jennifer Griffin called out the Trump administration. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=581.44s)]
*  Here's what she wrote on X. Gipmo detention plans hit another bump. The administration's decision [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=587.36s)]
*  to take migrants to Gitmo appears at best to have been an expensive photo op. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=592.24s)]
*  And she is right about that. It was an expensive photo op. It's not like this didn't cost anything. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=600.0s)]
*  So the operation has so far cost $16 million, according to representatives of the Guantanamo [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=604.48s)]
*  migrant detention mission, who briefed a congressional delegation during a visit last week. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=610.4s)]
*  It has a staff of 1,000 security forces and civilian contractors, many of them mobilized [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=616.0s)]
*  for military bases in the United States. And so what happens next? What's the plan? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=621.44s)]
*  What are we hearing from Trump? Well, Liz Frieden weighs in and says it's unclear if the United [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=627.2800000000001s)]
*  States will continue to hold migrants at Gitmo. None of the 195 tents set up have been used due [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=632.72s)]
*  to not meeting ICE standards, according to several US defense officials. The operation to build more [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  tents was halted in February, several weeks after it started. So no one knows what comes next. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=645.84s)]
*  And the legal challenges to the Gitmo detention policy are also headed to court. So that is [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  supposed to take place tomorrow. One lawsuit seeks a court order allowing detainees access to lawyers [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=661.44s)]
*  and another one is seeking to block the transfer of 10 migrants detained in the United States to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=668.0s)]
*  Guantanamo. I mean, it seems as though that lawsuit doesn't even need to go forward because [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=674.0s)]
*  Trump administration has actually halted this effort. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=678.96s)]
*  And who knows, maybe they were concerned that they could lose this court case, this lawsuit, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=681.52s)]
*  and maybe that's the reason why they backed off of it. But Trump is not one to cower at the threat [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=688.0s)]
*  of litigation. So I really think it's just that they didn't have the resources necessary to do [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=695.76s)]
*  this and it is a big waste of money. And he wanted to make a big show partly to please his [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=702.0s)]
*  voters for sure. But it also sends a message to other individuals around the world who might [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=708.72s)]
*  consider entering the country illegally, right? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=713.52s)]
*  Illegal border crossings have gone down significantly. And I do think it's because [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=716.64s)]
*  of some of the draconian things that Trump has been saying that he wants to do. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=720.8s)]
*  100%, just a couple of things to address what you mentioned earlier about how we tried to [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  warn people that a lot of this stuff was gonna be hard to carry out. Make no mistake that [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=730.08s)]
*  the people who got caught up in this Gitmo crossfire, that sucks. It's awful. The fact that [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=735.2800000000001s)]
*  these people are getting jerked around and taken to a freaking torture facility where these folks [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  just erected some tents, God knows what those conditions were gonna be like, the understaffing [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=745.52s)]
*  there. I mean, it was going to be a nightmare. So it's a great thing that that didn't happen. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=750.72s)]
*  I don't know, I can't speak to what the conditions are in places like these Louisiana [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=755.6s)]
*  detention facilities. But again, the idea that these places can hold all of the people that [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=760.08s)]
*  Trump claimed he was gonna move out of America. And of course, you guys know I'm against deportation, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  right? I do think we gotta fix the situation at the border. I think we need to make it more [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=773.76s)]
*  streamlined in pursuing these cases and saying yes or no to people. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=777.92s)]
*  I honestly think we have the capacity to take a lot of immigrants in, but whatever, that's a [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=783.52s)]
*  discussion for another day. But I think it's important that we cover this administration [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=789.5999999999999s)]
*  with a sober lens. So that when we do ring the freaking alarm, it's for things that actually [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=794.8s)]
*  matter, right? And the bottom line is, it's just not possible to do this in the way that Trump was [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=801.28s)]
*  bragging that he was going to. And the fact that this is the one thing he had the biggest mandate [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  for and who was he having his joint meetings with when he's meeting the media? It's Elon and his [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  Doge cronies. He's not meeting with the head of ICE. He's not meeting with the head of Department [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=820.56s)]
*  of Homeland Security, which allegedly this immigration stuff is a threat too. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=826.08s)]
*  He's doing everything else. He's buying Teslas, okay? He's not doing any of the immigration stuff. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=830.48s)]
*  And I think it's important that we remember that. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=837.36s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. And look, I especially wanna double down on what you're saying about covering Trump [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=839.44s)]
*  with a sober lens, because he is gonna do stuff that's awful, that's absolutely terrible. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=846.32s)]
*  And so if you're treating everything he does, like five alarm fire, you're ripping your hair [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=852.64s)]
*  out, you're fear mongering like crazy. Well, then when he actually does something that will come to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=858.48s)]
*  fruition, that is very harmful to a vulnerable group of people, I think audiences get fatigued [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=863.36s)]
*  and they just don't take it as seriously. So that's what we're trying to do here. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=870.08s)]
*  We'll see how his base reacts to this news, but that's what we've got on Gitmo and his efforts [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=875.36s)]
*  at mass deportation. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6SZ3Ki65bk&t=881.28s)]
