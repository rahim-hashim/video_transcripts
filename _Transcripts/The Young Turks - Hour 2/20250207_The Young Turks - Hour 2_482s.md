"A conservative writer who has written for publications such as The Federalist and The Daily Wire was arrested on charges of molesting a child under the age of 12.

Aaron Craig Gleason was booked in Okaloosa County, Florida on Jan 28 and posted bail in the amount of $75,000. The 39-year-old had written a praiseworthy review of Sound Of Freedom, an anti-sex trafficking film that he deemed a ‚Äúcall to action.‚Äù"

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

*  deemed a quote, call to action. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=47.82s)]
*  In the review, he wrote this, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=51.18s)]
*  it's about the children, lost, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=53.540000000000006s)]

*  And additionally in 2023, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=88.61999999999999s)]
*  Gleason quote tweeted a video of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=90.61999999999999s)]
*  pride marchers, some of whom were [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=93.13999999999999s)]
*  in drag, one person off camera and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=95.69999999999999s)]
*  video chants, we're here, we're [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  queer, we're coming for [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=100.78s)]
*  your children. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  In response, Gleason wrote, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=104.69999999999999s)]
*  no grooming going on here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  They were just coming for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=107.89999999999999s)]
*  our children. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  Ha ha ha, sweating, laughing emoji. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=110.13999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's sweating and laughing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=112.97999999999999s)]
*  as I said earlier, he was arrested [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=114.58s)]
*  for child molestation of a child [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=117.14s)]
*  under the age of 12. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=119.9s)]
*  As of right now, we don't have any [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=121.78s)]
*  other details on the case and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  don't expect them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=126.3s)]
*  But it's especially horrifying [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=127.9s)]
*  because in addition to his writing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=129.9s)]
*  gig, he also taught Bible school at [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=132.1s)]
*  Rocky Bayou Christian School and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=134.46s)]
*  was a middle school soccer coach. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=136.82s)]
*  According to his LinkedIn, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=139.3s)]
*  the superintendent of the school [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=141.22s)]
*  sent out an email to parents that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  said, I regret to inform you that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=145.62s)]
*  one of our middle school teachers [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=147.73999999999998s)]
*  was arrested today by local law [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=149.98s)]
*  enforcement officers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=151.82s)]
*  Teacher has been on paid [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  administrative leave and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  off campus for two weeks. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=156.66s)]
*  Please pray for our school and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  students during this difficult time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=161.14s)]
*  He was booked in Oskaloosa County, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  Florida on January 28th and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=166.66s)]
*  posted $75,000 bail. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=168.42s)]
*  So there hasn't been a conviction [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=170.62s)]
*  or a confession, so he can't say [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=172.17999999999998s)]
*  absolutely committed this crime. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=173.7s)]
*  Please remember that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  But he was arrested on it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=176.7s)]
*  Two on the nose, thoughts. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=179.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know what this is? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=182.29999999999998s)]
*  We learn this lesson when we're [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=184.26s)]
*  literally children, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  whoever smelled it dealt it, right? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=187.38s)]
*  It's the same concept, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=189.42s)]
*  the same principle, and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=190.7s)]
*  we're very familiar with it from [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=191.98s)]
*  children and as we grow up, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  it's the same thing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=195.14s)]
*  It's the same bad behavior. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=196.5s)]
*  People who see bad behavior [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=197.77999999999997s)]
*  everywhere are usually the ones who [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=199.06s)]
*  are familiar with that bad behavior [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=201.26s)]
*  in one way or another, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=202.82s)]
*  whether they were the ones who [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=203.86s)]
*  are doing the bad thing or [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=205.22s)]
*  if they were the victim of it, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=206.5s)]
*  they learn to recognize it in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=207.9s)]
*  places. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=209.22s)]
*  But it's not really people who have [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=209.74s)]
*  been victims of sexual harassment [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=211.34s)]
*  who are so anti-transgender. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=213.02s)]
*  If you're cheating on your partner, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=214.7s)]
*  you're probably going to be [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=216.46s)]
*  paranoid that they're cheating on [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=217.82s)]
*  you because you know how easy it [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=219.58s)]
*  is to hide that cheating. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=221.14s)]
*  You're doing it and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=222.3s)]
*  you're getting away with it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=223.02s)]
*  So why wouldn't they also be doing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=224.22s)]

*  hiding it the same way that you are? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=226.94s)]
*  Why wouldn't everyone be doing that? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=228.78s)]
*  It's the same principle. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=230.74s)]
*  And so yeah, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=232.06s)]
*  none of this is surprising. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=232.66s)]
*  I know you asked, and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=233.82000000000002s)]
*  I know you said we'd all be so [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=234.78s)]
*  surprised with this story and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=236.18s)]
*  I'm sorry to disappoint you, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=237.66s)]
*  Bright, but nobody is. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  Sorry, yes, but [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  you missed the rebuttal. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=242.18s)]
*  It's whoever made the rhyme did [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=243.26000000000002s)]
*  the crime in response to smelt it [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=245.46s)]
*  and dealt it, but still. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  Which is like so [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=249.54000000000002s)]
*  meta in and of itself. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=250.26000000000002s)]
*  Oddly, yeah, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=251.82000000000002s)]
*  because it is also a rhyme. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=252.78s)]
*  I mean, it hasn't rhymed or [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=254.78s)]
*  accused anyone. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=256.02s)]
*  So I guess I farted. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=257.22s)]
*  But in this particular case, as I'm [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=258.74s)]
*  glad you pointed that out, Brett, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=261.18s)]
*  because then as he's talking very [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=263.82s)]
*  seriously, I guess, about this [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=266.34s)]
*  horrific crime of predatory [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=268.74s)]
*  behavior towards children, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=270.9s)]
*  he's got a laughing, sweating, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=272.98s)]
*  crying, laughing emoji. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=275.34s)]
*  So there's all kinds of signs as to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=276.9s)]
*  the level of actual importance [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=278.82s)]
*  behind this and actually why he's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=280.62s)]
*  doing this approach and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=282.62s)]
*  coming after certain folks to, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=284.02s)]
*  of course, get the signal off of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=285.9s)]
*  him. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=287.82s)]
*  But you notice once he bring up [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=289.02s)]
*  drag queens, there was that whole [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=290.42s)]
*  push, maybe it was a year, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=292.06s)]
*  a year and a half ago, two years, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=293.38s)]
*  where, my God, there's a drag [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=294.86s)]
*  queen, there's a drag queen show. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=296.22s)]
*  Let's go into the club and look at [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=298.06s)]
*  the drag queens and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=299.22s)]
*  wonder why they're coming after [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=299.82s)]
*  children. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=301.06s)]
*  Hey, let's go to this particular [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=301.62s)]
*  drag queens show. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=303.22s)]
*  Check it out, take a look, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=304.82s)]
*  dance to the music a little bit, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=306.14s)]
*  maybe bop, snap some fingers. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=307.74s)]
*  And then let's talk about how [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=309.22s)]
*  they're coming after children. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=310.38s)]
*  Yet people like this guy find [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  themselves in schools, playgrounds, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=313.22s)]
*  and churches, sorry, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=315.46000000000004s)]
*  churches, where they're around [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=316.82s)]
*  children all the time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=318.7s)]

*  The blatant clarity with which we [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  can see where the bad guys like to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  operate, yet we're supposed to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=333.5s)]

*  are coming after them. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=345.42s)]
*  And then when this is happening, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  we just let it slide. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=349.14000000000004s)]
*  As a society in general, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=350.66s)]

*  on. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV_iI-uaFx0&t=358.3s)]
