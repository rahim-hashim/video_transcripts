"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) insulted a questioner at a town hall in her district on Tuesday night.

The MAGA firebrand held the forum in Cobb County, Georgia, where she read questions on a screen. At one point, she was asked about President Donald Trump and Elon Musk taking a wrecking ball to federal agencies over the past three months via Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúDepartment of Government‚Äù efficiency. The questioner also asked about Trump‚Äôs whiplash tariff policy."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Marjorie Taylor Greene's Town Hall Goes OFF THE RAILS
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M)
*  Eight illegal alien criminals, cartels, and terrorists that are not just living at the border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=0.0s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, they're all inside the interior of the United States. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=8.4s)]
*  All inside the interior of the United States. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=13.0s)]
*  The protest is outside. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=18.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=23.0s)]
*  Protest is outside. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=24.0s)]
*  You can head out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=25.0s)]
*  The protest is outside. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=32.0s)]
*  The propaganda is in here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=33.0s)]
*  You gotta keep those segregated as you must keep all things. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=35.0s)]
*  So that's Marjorie Green. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=39.0s)]
*  She's having her little town hall and that woman, well, I think raises a really good [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=40.0s)]
*  point, which we'll talk about. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=43.0s)]
*  It's not the only person who got removed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=44.0s)]
*  Now she thankfully was just removed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=46.0s)]
*  Other people were the recipients of a little bit of state violence. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=48.0s)]
*  So that's fun. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=51.0s)]
*  But what you saw there was Marge trying to spread her little talking points that she [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=53.0s)]
*  is so desperate to cling to from before the election that we are obviously awash in millions [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=57.0s)]
*  of migrant murderers. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=62.8s)]
*  And so the Constitution, just set that aside. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=64.5s)]
*  Don't worry about all that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=67.0s)]
*  We could do literally whatever we want to get rid of these people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=68.0s)]
*  And I know what you're thinking. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=70.0s)]
*  All the studies show that the vast, vast, vast majority of the people were deporting have [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=71.84s)]
*  no criminal record whatsoever, but ignore that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=75.28s)]
*  Wouldn't it be better if they were murderers? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=78.2s)]
*  Would you shut up and just sit down and let us do whatever we want if they were murderers? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=81.2s)]
*  So the woman brings up the KKK. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=85.28s)]
*  Okay, well, that's a terrorist organization. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=86.28s)]
*  It's literally a terrorist organization with a multi-century history of doing terrible [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=89.16s)]
*  things. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=93.84s)]
*  She's gonna say one single word about them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=94.84s)]
*  Should they be deported to El Salvador? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=96.28s)]
*  They're hardly black or brown. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Forget about them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  And so you had a number of people who were interrupting it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=102.5s)]
*  And look at these sorts of town halls. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=105.4s)]
*  If you yell, if you interrupt, they're generally gonna make you leave. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=107.76s)]
*  But it got more violent than just that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=111.26s)]
*  So she had barely reached the podium to speak when one man stood up and started yelling, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=113.6s)]
*  booing, and jeering at her. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=118.44s)]
*  And she didn't like that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=120.62s)]
*  I know you'd probably think she'd be used to it by now, but she was taken aback. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=121.62s)]
*  So her supporters, which exist, stood and clapped. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=125.4s)]
*  So police officers grabbed the man and dragged him out of the room. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=128.76s)]
*  They also used a stun gun on him twice after failing to put his arms behind his back. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=132.06s)]
*  And he wasn't the only person that got stunned. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  So Green began to play a video of former President Barack Obama discussing the national debt. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=140.0s)]
*  He contributed to it, so that's bad. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=146.8s)]
*  The fact that Trump added $8 trillion to the national debt, I'm sure also probably had [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=148.32s)]
*  a video presentation from Green. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=152.72s)]
*  But anyway, another guy was removed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=155.06s)]
*  This is Johnny Keith Williams of Georgia. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=157.12s)]
*  He had started to heckle her. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=160.4s)]
*  They stunned him as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=161.6s)]
*  Six people in total were escorted out. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=163.88s)]
*  Three were arrested and two were hit with stun guns, which are referred to as non-lethal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=166.56s)]
*  But of course, people have died thanks to those. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=172.24s)]
*  So not as raucous as some of the town halls, although it's hard to imagine that it's just [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=175.4s)]
*  a coincidence that it's Green's town hall where we're all of a sudden having the weapons [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=180.74s)]
*  being used. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=185.62s)]
*  There's been disruptions of Republican town halls for months now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=186.62s)]
*  And this is the first I've seen of stun guns, Brett, but what do you think? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=189.8s)]
*  Not as raucous as some of the town halls. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=193.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  Explode a glitter bomb or something? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=196.61999999999998s)]
*  Was there shrapnel? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=200.33999999999997s)]
*  You just told stun gun stories. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=201.33999999999997s)]
*  I always wondered, I guess I assumed that every time that if we were to join Marjorie [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=206.73999999999998s)]
*  Taylor Green in the middle of whatever she's doing, I mean, it was amazing that the first [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  thing she said was, illegal aliens. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=218.94s)]
*  She's always talking like this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=222.98s)]
*  This is the thing where it's so weird. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=225.1s)]
*  You have some people be like, can we please treat all individuals with some modicum of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  respect and at least listen to people when they're discussing their identities or anything. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=232.38s)]
*  And it's like, you guys are psychopaths, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=238.5s)]
*  But Marjorie Taylor Green is spinning whole yarns about hordes and hordes of secret gangs [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=242.14s)]
*  that are trying to kidnap your child at night. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  And how are they not treated like psychos? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=255.44s)]
*  It's because we've gone nose blind to the psychoteness. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=259.2s)]
*  It's such a weird position we're in. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=264.26s)]
*  We're like, that is insane. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=265.72s)]
*  What was said before the woman in the audience was like, that's crazy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=269.06s)]
*  She heard something, so she said something. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  And everyone just kind of goes along with it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=279.36s)]
*  It's this weird defense of Trump where it's like, he's just lying. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=283.04s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Green, she's just kind of stupid and a weirdo. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  So she just kind of says the vaguely party line things that the Republicans have been [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=293.48s)]
*  kind of elbowing into normalcy for years and years and years. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=297.64s)]
*  And we're just supposed to sit down and take it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=303.36s)]
*  It's so strange, but it's so sad at the same time. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=307.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's really gross to see someone with at least a little bit of power. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=310.96s)]
*  I mean, she doesn't really have any independent power. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=314.64s)]
*  She's just gonna do whatever Donald Trump tells her to do. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=316.64s)]
*  But that she's just a random gross bigot. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  That's all that she is. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=322.2s)]
*  She happened to be in an area that's red enough that you can just be a gross dumb bigot and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=323.52s)]
*  still get elected. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  And so she stands up there and does she even know the analyses of those who've been sent [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  to Venezuela, like 77% had no criminal record whatsoever, including shoplifting, littering, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=335.28s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=341.2s)]
*  And then once you include those, it's basically like the sorts of criminals she's talking [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=342.2s)]
*  about was like less than 1% of those who were deported. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=345.64s)]
*  And I think that's not just a thing to point out because it makes her look stupid and wrong. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  That would be enough. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  I would do it if that was all it was. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  But it's more important than that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  It's a refutation of the entire narrative. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=358.9s)]
*  If there were actually all of these terrible criminals, rapists, murderers, all of that, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=361.36s)]
*  then they'd be packing planes with them and they'd be advertising every one. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=365.64s)]

*  No one has lost their benefits. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=478.92s)]

*  There's a little bit of hypocrisy there that you're standing by your president who is himself [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=495.68s)]
*  guilty of literally dozens of felonies. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=499.44s)]
*  You're standing by him, an actual criminal. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=502.12s)]
*  Gilmar, a Bergero Garcia, no crimes, no crimes at all. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=504.24s)]
*  So why is it that he doesn't have a criminal record but you talk about him as if he's a [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=508.92s)]
*  terrorist? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=512.12s)]
*  Donald Trump already adjudicated, civilly responsible for sexual assault, literally [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=513.12s)]
*  dozens of felonies and more than likely would have suffered more guilty verdicts for felonies [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=518.52s)]
*  if the Supreme Court hadn't swooped in and saved him. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=524.28s)]
*  And you go through that laundry list and I appreciate that she read the entire thing. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=527.8s)]
*  You could read that as her being brave enough to read the entire thing before answering [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=531.96s)]
*  for me. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  It's that I think that her grasp on literacy is so tenuous that she can't read something [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  while simultaneously seeing the rest of the paragraph out of the corner of her eye. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  It's an important skill like when you're presenting news or when you're doing a town hall. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=543.88s)]
*  She doesn't have it, unfortunately. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=547.44s)]
*  She got through the entire sentence. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=549.08s)]
*  Some of the words started to trip her up a little bit. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=550.84s)]
*  But what exactly was Christina wrong about? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=553.46s)]
*  The trade war is not going to cause hardships, not going to cause prices to go up and obviously, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=555.7800000000001s)]
*  is going to do that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=560.56s)]
*  Nobody's lost Social Security. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=562.2s)]
*  We've literally profiled individuals that have. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=563.52s)]
*  You don't get to cut the regional staff by 80% shut down the online services and assume [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=565.7s)]
*  that is probably not have any negative effect whatsoever. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=571.28s)]
*  And notice she mentioned that Christina was wrong, I guess, about Medicaid cuts, but then [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=574.36s)]
*  didn't actually talk about it anymore. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=577.96s)]
*  Because what, in a day or two, she's going to be voting for massive cuts to Medicaid. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=579.88s)]
*  That's her plan right now. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=585.08s)]
*  She needs to pretend that Christina, she watches Rachel Maddow. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=587.14s)]
*  She's clearly crazy or whatever. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=589.74s)]
*  But Marjorie Green knows exactly how right she is. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=591.78s)]
*  And she knows that Donald Trump is flouting not only the law, but the Constitution. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=594.42s)]
*  She knows that because she loves that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  She doesn't want him to comply with it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=600.78s)]
*  Due process is not in her system of values and she's fine with the fact that it's not [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=602.24s)]
*  in Donald Trump's either. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=606.3s)]
*  And so, she's the congressperson. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=608.22s)]
*  She's behind the podium, but Christina clearly objectively deserves that position more than [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=610.66s)]
*  Marjorie Green. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=615.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I like it when she's like, listen, you've been brainwashed by your news source. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=617.12s)]
*  And that's our news sources job. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=625.3800000000001s)]
*  My job is to brainwash you. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=627.94s)]
*  She is trying to justify Trump's approach to tariffs as some kind of strategy. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=631.6400000000001s)]
*  It is not. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=638.46s)]
*  It is giving button masher in Street Fighter 2. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=641.26s)]
*  That is Trump's entire strategy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if people are from the same generation I'm from. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=650.2199999999999s)]
*  We used to have these arcade games. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=652.76s)]
*  One of them was called Street Fighter 2. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=654.2199999999999s)]
*  And you get someone who was really great and memorized all the button sequences to do the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=655.9799999999999s)]
*  moves. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=659.78s)]
*  And then you'd go up against someone who was just mashing all the buttons. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=661.66s)]
*  Usually that person would lose to the person who knew what they were doing. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=666.2199999999999s)]
*  But occasionally the person mashing the buttons would land a jab or [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=669.44s)]
*  a thousand hand slap. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=674.1600000000001s)]
*  And they would claim victory as being this wildly skilled person, but [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=677.12s)]
*  that is what Trump is doing. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=681.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, hold on. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=683.84s)]
*  And Marjorie Taylor Green is trying to paint him as being this kind of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=684.4000000000001s)]
*  international economic genius when all he's done is like bankrupted casinos. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=687.5600000000001s)]
*  I love your metaphor, but I think the accurate metaphor in this would be that he [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=692.64s)]
*  was button mashing. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=697.0s)]
*  He lost and then claimed victory because the stock market is still down. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=698.72s)]
*  Prices are still going to be going up. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=703.32s)]
*  We still have to, the tariff on China is 245% right now. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  That is not a win. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=710.76s)]
*  He did not win. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=711.88s)]
*  They are declaring victory because he cut the stock market by 20%. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=713.0s)]
*  And then it went back up 11. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=717.28s)]
*  And now they're cheering. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=719.0400000000001s)]
*  They're celebrating. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=719.96s)]
*  That's a loss to any rational person. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=720.76s)]
*  There is no rationality. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=724.6s)]
*  The more I think about I feel bad for Marjorie Taylor Green. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=726.68s)]
*  I mean, she's earned better than that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, has she ever during an official proceeding heckled someone from [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=732.52s)]
*  the audience besides the state of the union? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=736.72s)]
*  No, maybe if there is some kind of justice in this world, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=740.3199999999999s)]
*  next time she heckles a president, she gets tased and escorted out. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=743.4s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=750.04s)]
*  And it's weird because she should be nicknamed Taserface. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=751.08s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=754.88s)]
*  Totally not true. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=757.96s)]
*  But it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCURj8_je9M&t=759.0400000000001s)]
