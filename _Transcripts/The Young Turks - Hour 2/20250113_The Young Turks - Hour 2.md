"Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs nominee for director of national intelligence, is changing her tune on a key intelligence-gathering authority she once sought to repeal as her Senate confirmation hangs in the balance.

Gabbard‚Äôs past criticisms of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act have emerged as a central issue in her confirmation process, leaving GOP senators ‚Äî including some in leadership ‚Äî increasingly skeptical about the former Democrat‚Äôs confirmation prospects.

In her first public comments since being nominated, Gabbard told us in an exclusive statement that she now supports Section 702, saying the program is ‚Äúcrucial‚Äù and ‚Äúmust be safeguarded to protect our nation while ensuring the civil liberties of Americans.‚Äù*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Tulsi Gabbard 'Big Brother Isn't So Bad'
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40)
*  Tulsi Gabbard, who of course is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's pick to serve as [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=2.38s)]
*  director of National Intelligence, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=4.76s)]
*  has now reversed her position on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=7.66s)]
*  government spying. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=10.06s)]
*  This is definitely a big downer, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=11.58s)]
*  especially considering the fact [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=13.34s)]
*  that one of her redeeming qualities [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=15.0s)]
*  was the fact that she consistently [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=16.84s)]
*  spoke out against government [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=18.8s)]
*  surveillance. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=20.34s)]
*  But not anymore, suddenly she's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  a proponent of the government [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  surveillance authority that she had [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=24.54s)]
*  previously wanted to entirely [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=26.5s)]
*  dismantle. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=28.2s)]
*  And there's some reason to believe [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=29.62s)]
*  that she's doing it because she [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=31.38s)]
*  wants to get confirmed for [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=32.98s)]
*  the position that Donald Trump has [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=34.34s)]
*  tapped her for. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=36.14s)]
*  Now at issue is something known as [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=36.94s)]
*  FISA section 702. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=39.14s)]
*  If you're unfamiliar with that, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  it was basically a provision within [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=43.06s)]
*  the giant amount of legislation [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=45.94s)]
*  that was passed following the 9-11 [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=48.42s)]
*  terrorist attacks that essentially [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=51.22s)]
*  provided government with more [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=53.78s)]
*  surveillance authority. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  Again, it passed right after 9-11, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=57.92s)]
*  but it was enacted in 2008. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  Now Tulsi Gabbard previously had [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=61.82s)]
*  a problem with FISA section 702 [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=64.28s)]
*  because it was being used to spy [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=66.74s)]
*  on American citizens without [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=69.1s)]
*  a warrant. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=71.32s)]
*  Now she's telling CNN, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=72.18s)]
*  I'm all for it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=74.14s)]
*  Okay, so before we get to her [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=76.6s)]
*  reversal, here are some issues with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  the FISA laws and how it was [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=81.08s)]
*  negatively impacting American [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=83.02s)]
*  citizens. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=85.1s)]
*  So while FISA 702 surveillance must [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=85.78s)]
*  be directed at foreigners abroad [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  that are suspected of planning or [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=90.78s)]
*  engaging in terrorist activities [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  against the United States or [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=95.28s)]
*  Americans, unfortunately, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=97.12s)]
*  there was a loophole that allowed [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=99.22s)]
*  for the FBI and the intelligence [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=101.38s)]
*  community to essentially spy on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=103.44s)]
*  American citizens. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=105.42s)]
*  Intelligence agencies deliberately [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=106.94s)]
*  search for communications of US [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=109.34s)]
*  persons within FISA 702 and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=111.5s)]
*  citizens within FISA 702 data or [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=113.34s)]
*  query it without court approval, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  meaning no warrants from a judge is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=118.38s)]
*  necessary. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=120.84s)]
*  And many innocent Americans were [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=121.7s)]
*  spied on as a result of this, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=123.94s)]
*  including peaceful protesters, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  lawmakers, journalists, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=128.14s)]
*  even political donors. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=129.98s)]
*  Now, for example, even though [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=131.7s)]
*  internal rules at the FBI indicate [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=133.82s)]
*  that the FBI should not be spying [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=136.18s)]
*  on American citizens by using [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=138.42s)]
*  FISA 702 data, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=140.42s)]
*  by using FISA section 702, in 2002, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=141.82s)]
*  just as an example, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=144.86s)]
*  the FBI conducted over 200,000 US [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=146.54s)]
*  person queries, including an [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=149.52s)]
*  estimated 4,000 in violation of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=152.04s)]
*  their own rules. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=154.6s)]
*  So this is why Gabbard rightly had [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=155.98000000000002s)]
*  a problem with FISA section 702, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=158.34s)]
*  but now she argues that's not [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=160.76s)]
*  the case. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=162.72s)]
*  She says that section 702, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=164.1s)]
*  unlike other FISA authorities, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=165.84s)]
*  is crucial for gathering foreign [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  intelligence on non-US persons [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=169.82s)]
*  abroad. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=171.82s)]
*  This unique capability cannot be [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=172.9s)]
*  replicated and must be safeguarded [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=175.22s)]
*  to protect our nation while [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=177.74s)]
*  ensuring the civil liberties of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=179.66s)]
*  Americans. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=181.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=183.82s)]
*  neoconservatives say in defending [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=185.58s)]
*  FISA section 702. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=187.94s)]
*  But let me give you more of her [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  statement, which she provided to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=190.9s)]
*  CNN. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=192.58s)]
*  My prior concerns about FISA were [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=193.08s)]
*  based on insufficient protections [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=194.86s)]
*  for civil liberties, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=196.66s)]
*  regarding the FBI's misuse of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=197.98s)]
*  warrantless search powers on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=199.82s)]
*  American citizens. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=201.66s)]
*  Significant FISA reforms have been [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=203.06s)]
*  enacted since my time in Congress [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=205.66s)]
*  to address these issues. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=208.1s)]
*  If confirmed as Director of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=210.5s)]
*  National Intelligence, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=211.96s)]
*  I will uphold Americans' Fourth [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=213.5s)]
*  Amendment rights while maintaining [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=215.3s)]
*  vital national security tools like [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=217.34s)]
*  section 702 to ensure the safety [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=219.5s)]
*  and freedom of the American people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  Now, I just want to be clear, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=224.9s)]
*  she was very much against this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=227.18s)]
*  previously. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=229.46s)]
*  In fact, she tried to repeal both [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=231.06s)]
*  the Patriot Act and section 702 [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=233.06s)]
*  shortly before she left Congress [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=235.06s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=237.06s)]
*  Also in her memoir, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=238.46s)]
*  Gabbard wrote the following. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=239.74s)]
*  The intelligence community and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=241.22s)]
*  national security state are so [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=243.54000000000002s)]
*  supremely powerful and accountable [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=245.78s)]
*  to no one that even the President [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=248.5s)]
*  of the United States better not [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=251.06s)]
*  dare criticize them. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=253.46s)]
*  That's from her memoir. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  But let's go back to her argument [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=257.58s)]
*  that there have been meaningful [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=259.86s)]
*  reforms to FISA section 702 since [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=262.22s)]
*  she spoke out against it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=264.62s)]
*  Turns out that is not the case. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=266.74s)]
*  And I'm going to cite an [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=268.42s)]
*  organization known as the Center [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=269.58s)]
*  for Democracy and Technology to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=271.3s)]
*  argue why. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=272.98s)]
*  They write that although supporters [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=273.86s)]
*  of the new law, the Reforming [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=275.94s)]
*  Intelligence and Securing America [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=277.7s)]
*  Act, HR 7888, claimed it contained [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=279.9s)]
*  meaningful reforms, the bill [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=282.06s)]
*  largely preserved a problematic [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=283.98s)]
*  and actually expanded surveillance [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=286.54s)]
*  at an alarming manner. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=288.98s)]
*  The so called reformed version does [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=291.1s)]
*  not require the intelligence [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=293.62s)]
*  community to obtain a warrant from [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=295.94s)]
*  a judge. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=298.42s)]
*  The warrant requirement was [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=299.26s)]
*  considered an amendment in the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=301.3s)]
*  House of Representatives, but [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  the outcome was tied with a 212 to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=305.98s)]
*  212 vote. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=308.66s)]
*  And in the Senate, that amendment [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=310.86s)]
*  was entirely defeated. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  So the warrant requirement was [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=314.74s)]
*  totally taken out as an amendment [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=316.82s)]
*  in the so called reforms of FISA 702. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=319.06s)]
*  And the Biden administration and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=321.86s)]
*  congressional leadership insisted [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=323.86s)]
*  that senators oppose all amendments [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=326.18s)]
*  to avoid FISA lapsing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=328.66s)]
*  The amendment that would have [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=330.38s)]
*  imposed the warrant rule failed by [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=332.26s)]
*  a 42 to 50 vote, Cenk. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=334.58s)]
*  Yeah, so look, you're addressing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=337.14s)]
*  a couple points I wanted to make. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=339.02s)]
*  What meaningful reform? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=340.86s)]
*  Okay, all right, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=342.58s)]
*  hearings, right? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=344.54s)]
*  I mean, the problem is that almost [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=345.42s)]
*  all the Democrats and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=347.42s)]
*  Republicans want to do [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=348.62s)]
*  warrantless wiretapping. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=349.86s)]
*  So I don't know if this is going to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  get a single hard question in [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=352.86s)]
*  the right direction here. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=354.38s)]
*  They'll probably be like, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=356.06s)]
*  how dare you ever oppose warrantless [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=357.46000000000004s)]
*  wiretapping of American citizens? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=359.3s)]
*  Don't you know they're lower than [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=361.06s)]
*  us? We have to wiretap them and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=362.66s)]
*  do it illegally. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=364.22s)]
*  And she'll be like, no, no, no, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=365.3s)]
*  I'm all totally in favor of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=366.82s)]
*  illegal warrantless wiretapping. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=367.94s)]
*  Yes, I love it now that I'm going [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=369.66s)]
*  to get this position of power, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=370.98s)]
*  right? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=372.22s)]
*  But is anybody going to actually [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=373.38s)]
*  ask the question, okay, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=374.62s)]
*  what meaningful reforms are you [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=375.5s)]
*  talking about? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=376.62s)]
*  And when those meaningful reforms [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=377.38s)]
*  came out or passed, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=379.46s)]
*  why didn't you say at the time [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=380.62s)]
*  that, wow, hey, look at that, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=382.29999999999995s)]
*  they reformed 702, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=384.06s)]
*  now I'm in favor of it? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=385.26s)]
*  You didn't do that, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=387.41999999999996s)]
*  because you know why? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=388.34s)]
*  Because you're lying both times. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=390.18s)]
*  So for example, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=392.97999999999996s)]
*  Plastic Break Dragon wrote in at [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=393.85999999999996s)]
*  TYT.com, he's a member. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=395.5s)]
*  We love our members, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=397.46s)]
*  become a member, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=398.41999999999996s)]
*  hit the join button, etc. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=399.02s)]
*  But then he wrote in, Ana, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  are you truly surprised by [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=401.38s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard's flip-flop? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=402.34s)]
*  This is what she does depending on [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=404.06s)]
*  how it benefits her at the moment. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=406.06s)]
*  And of course, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=408.5s)]
*  Ana's not surprised. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=409.09999999999997s)]
*  Ana's the first person who called [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=409.94s)]
*  out Tulsi Gabbard for being a fraud. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=412.09999999999997s)]
*  And she took a ton of heat for [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=414.65999999999997s)]
*  that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=416.34s)]
*  I don't remember a lot of those [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=418.06s)]
*  people who thought she was [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=419.05999999999995s)]
*  the greatest progressive in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=419.97999999999996s)]
*  the world coming back and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=420.94s)]
*  apologizing to Ana for being [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=422.02s)]
*  100% right about that, right? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  And why does she do that? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  Because she studied Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=426.85999999999996s)]
*  She studied her policies. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=428.29999999999995s)]
*  She studied her statements because [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=429.7s)]
*  she was running for [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=430.78s)]
*  president at the time in 2020. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=431.34s)]
*  And what she found out was, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=433.17999999999995s)]
*  first of all, she's not really a [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=434.61999999999995s)]
*  progressive at all based on her [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=436.61999999999995s)]
*  policy positions, but [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  that's not even the important part. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  It's unclear what she believes at [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=442.82s)]
*  any time. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=444.97999999999996s)]
*  She's just constantly looking for [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=446.21999999999997s)]
*  a way to get in power. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=448.09999999999997s)]
*  First, she was a Hillary Clinton [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=449.82s)]
*  supporter, then she was a Bernie [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=450.94s)]
*  Sanders supporter. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=452.26s)]
*  Now she's a Donald Trump supporter [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=452.9s)]
*  with no logic, rhyme, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=454.7s)]
*  or reason as to why. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=455.97999999999996s)]
*  It's just power, precious. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=457.5s)]
*  So okay, tell me section 702, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=460.66s)]
*  what changed? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=462.38000000000005s)]
*  Go ahead, Tulsi, what changed? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=463.74s)]
*  I'll tell you what changed. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=465.86s)]
*  In order to get into power, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=467.14000000000004s)]
*  you needed to kiss the ass of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=468.74s)]
*  Republican establishment [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=470.34000000000003s)]
*  politicians. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  So that's what you're doing now. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=473.1s)]
*  So I mean, I hope you're lying to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=475.1s)]
*  them, and I wrote about this [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=476.70000000000005s)]
*  in social media. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=478.26000000000005s)]
*  And interestingly enough, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=479.66s)]
*  the right-wing reaction was, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=481.02000000000004s)]
*  you're right, that's super [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=482.58000000000004s)]
*  disconcerting because we really [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=484.1s)]
*  were against warrantless [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  wiretapping, and that's part of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=487.1s)]
*  why we like Tulsi. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=488.70000000000005s)]
*  You're right about that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=489.9s)]
*  So Tim Burjet, I should say, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=490.62s)]
*  who's a Republican lawmaker in [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=492.5s)]
*  Congress, actually voted against [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  renewing FISA section 702 last year [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=497.46s)]
*  when it was up for a vote. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=500.62s)]
*  And he specifically called out [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=503.02s)]
*  the fact that it is a violation of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=505.29999999999995s)]
*  Americans' Fourth Amendment rights. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=507.7s)]
*  And so there's actually [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=510.46s)]
*  bipartisan support in doing away [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=512.18s)]
*  with this warrantless wiretapping, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=514.6999999999999s)]
*  which allegedly is only focused on [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=518.46s)]
*  foreigners, but in reality, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=520.58s)]
*  a lot of innocent American citizens [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=522.58s)]
*  get caught up in it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=524.74s)]
*  Unfortunately, there aren't enough [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=526.1s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans in [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=528.22s)]
*  Congress to fight back against this [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=529.9000000000001s)]
*  type of legislation, and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=531.82s)]
*  it got renewed. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=533.1s)]
*  Now it's set to sunset in 2026. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=533.82s)]
*  But with, look, what she said [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=537.4200000000001s)]
*  originally in her memoir about [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=539.38s)]
*  the power of the intelligence [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=541.34s)]
*  community in America was absolutely [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=543.1s)]
*  right. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=545.34s)]
*  And unfortunately, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=546.0200000000001s)]
*  that power is playing a huge role [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=547.14s)]
*  in the renewal year after year of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=549.34s)]
*  this legislation. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=551.74s)]
*  And if you're worried about big [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=554.5s)]
*  government, if you're worried about [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=556.1s)]
*  Big Brother watching, then you [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=557.94s)]
*  should be worried about FISA section [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=559.5400000000001s)]
*  702. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=561.4200000000001s)]
*  It should not have been renewed, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=561.9200000000001s)]
*  and no, it was not renewed with [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=563.5400000000001s)]
*  significant reforms. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=565.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, one of the most important [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=566.1s)]
*  reforms was to ensure that the FBI [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=568.14s)]
*  obtains warrants before wiretapping [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=570.22s)]
*  people. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=572.6600000000001s)]
*  They still don't have to do that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=573.26s)]
*  It's still a huge issue. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=576.1s)]
*  And- [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=578.14s)]
*  So- [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=578.34s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=579.02s)]
*  And look, this is another one of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=580.14s)]
*  those where right wing and left [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=581.82s)]
*  wing populists agree. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=583.38s)]
*  We don't want warrantless [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=584.7s)]
*  wiretapping of Americans. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=586.22s)]
*  And God help you if you know anyone [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=587.86s)]
*  that lives abroad, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=589.22s)]
*  because if you talk to them, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=590.14s)]
*  you probably got caught up in this [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=591.5400000000001s)]
*  and they probably wiretapped, okay? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=593.26s)]
*  So, and it's disgusting. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=595.9s)]
*  But the only hope that remains is [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=599.9s)]
*  that Tulsi Gabbard's such [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=602.22s)]
*  a pathological liar. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=604.14s)]
*  And is so cares about power and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=605.9399999999999s)]
*  only power that she's lying to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=608.18s)]
*  the senators, and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=610.4599999999999s)]
*  she's actually against 702. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=611.6999999999999s)]
*  And that when she gets into office [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=614.02s)]
*  that she won't renew it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=616.14s)]
*  But that's a kind of a hilarious [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=618.18s)]
*  thing to root for. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=619.74s)]
*  God, I hope she's a liar. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=620.5799999999999s)]
*  I hope she's lying through her [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=622.38s)]
*  teeth. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=623.9399999999999s)]
*  But when you're rooting for [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=624.5s)]
*  someone to be a liar, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=625.9399999999999s)]
*  are you sure you know which [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=627.06s)]
*  direction they're going to lie in? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=628.5799999999999s)]
*  Are you sure that they're lying to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=631.18s)]
*  the other guys and not you? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=633.1s)]
*  I mean, look, here's the last thing [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=636.38s)]
*  on it, Trump got popular partly by [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=638.34s)]
*  getting a new portion of his base, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=640.4599999999999s)]
*  these right wing populists. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=642.62s)]
*  And you could tell they're new [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=644.54s)]
*  because the old republic, I know [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=646.14s)]
*  I've been covering politics for [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=647.78s)]
*  quarter of a century. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=649.42s)]
*  All the republicans would have been [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=650.74s)]
*  like, world is wiretapping is [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=652.26s)]
*  the greatest thing in the world. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=653.62s)]
*  You're endangering national [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=655.06s)]
*  security. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=656.34s)]
*  If you don't want to be wiretapped, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=656.9s)]
*  you're a terrorist. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=658.4599999999999s)]
*  I've dealt with those guys for [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=659.4599999999999s)]
*  over 20 years, right? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=660.74s)]
*  So if Trump won because his base [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=662.5s)]
*  doesn't like 702 and doesn't like [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=664.74s)]
*  warless wiretapping, why doesn't he [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=666.9s)]
*  have his nominee go tell the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=669.46s)]
*  senators to their face, yeah, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=671.34s)]
*  we're against 702 and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=673.54s)]
*  President Trump sent me, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=675.22s)]
*  what are you going to do about it? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=677.06s)]
*  So I don't even, by the way, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=680.78s)]
*  who are we kidding? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=682.46s)]
*  What does President Trump think? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=683.86s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=685.66s)]
*  We don't even know the no section [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=687.22s)]
*  702. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=689.26s)]
*  So he's going to have her go kiss [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=690.42s)]
*  up to the establishment and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=692.26s)]
*  she'll probably serve [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=693.98s)]
*  the establishment. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=695.1800000000001s)]
*  Because Trump's asleep at the wheel. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=696.3s)]
*  What do you think Trump? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=698.3s)]
*  Do you agree with 702 or don't you? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=699.38s)]
*  There's no chance he even knows [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=702.1800000000001s)]
*  what it is. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYJkbCMDu40&t=703.3s)]
