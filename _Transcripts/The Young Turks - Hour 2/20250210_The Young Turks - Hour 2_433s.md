"Five former Treasury Secretaries issued a stark warning calling out President Donald Trump‚Äôs latest moves at the Treasury as a direct threat to American democracy‚Äôs financial backbone in a show of rising alarm.

The letter, published in The New York Times, unites Robert E. Rubin, Lawrence H. Summers, Timothy F. Geithner, Jacob J. Lew, and Janet L. Yellen‚Äîall veterans of Democratic administrations‚Äîin condemning what they describe as ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious political control of federal payments.‚Äù*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# THIS IS HOW TYRANNY BEGINS
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo)
*  Today, a federal judge has accused [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=0.0s)]
*  the Trump administration of [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=2.44s)]
*  essentially ignoring his court [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=4.42s)]
*  order. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=6.66s)]
*  And this has to do with the Trump [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=7.2s)]
*  administration putting a freeze on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=9.6s)]
*  federal grants. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=12.44s)]
*  After that was challenged in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=15.32s)]
*  the courts, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=16.84s)]
*  the Trump administration claimed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=17.52s)]
*  that they had rescinded the freeze [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=19.48s)]
*  on federal grants. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=21.36s)]
*  But it turns out that they didn't [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=23.32s)]
*  actually follow through on it, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=24.88s)]
*  even though they claimed they had [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=26.32s)]
*  rescinded this action. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=27.72s)]
*  So here's how the fight between [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=28.84s)]
*  Donald Trump and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=30.42s)]
*  the courts went down. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=31.14s)]
*  So last month, the Trump [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=32.34s)]
*  administration issued this memo, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=33.68s)]
*  outlining a freeze in federal [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=35.66s)]
*  funding grants. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=37.24s)]
*  Now the purpose of the freeze was [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=38.58s)]
*  to check whether federal programs [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=40.58s)]
*  were in compliance with Donald [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=42.74s)]
*  Trump's rules as it pertains to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=44.54s)]
*  banning DEI practices. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=46.46s)]
*  He also wanted to ban funding for [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=48.54s)]
*  renewable energy projects. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=50.74s)]
*  Now this caused widespread panic [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  and government officials scrambled [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=55.1s)]
*  to figure out what it all means and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=57.18s)]
*  which programs would be impacted. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=59.5s)]
*  At that point, 22 states and DC [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=62.42s)]
*  sued, which led to Judge John [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=65.56s)]
*  McConnell issuing a temporary [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=68.4s)]
*  freeze or a block on the Trump [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=71.2s)]
*  administration's federal funding [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=73.62s)]
*  freeze. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=76.22s)]
*  Now at that point, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=76.78s)]
*  the Trump administration withdrew [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=77.78s)]
*  their memo, essentially they [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=79.9s)]
*  rescinded, based on their memo, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=81.58s)]
*  this freeze on federal funding. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=83.58s)]
*  But the judge found that while the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=85.86s)]
*  Trump administration did withdraw [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=87.98s)]
*  the memo, they didn't actually end [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=90.18s)]
*  their freeze of federal grants. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=92.38s)]
*  And so this post from the White [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=94.94s)]
*  House Press Secretary, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=97.0s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, stated that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=98.74s)]
*  the freeze was actually still [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=100.58s)]
*  in effect. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=102.18s)]
*  It's not like they were even trying [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=102.9s)]
*  to hide it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=104.16s)]
*  So this is what she wrote. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=104.7s)]
*  This is not a rescission of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=107.58s)]
*  the federal funding freeze, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  it is simply a rescission of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=111.82s)]
*  the OMB memo. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=113.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=114.78s)]
*  To end any confusion created by [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=115.66s)]
*  the court's injunction. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=117.54s)]
*  The president's executive orders on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=119.06s)]
*  federal funding remain in full [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  force and effect, and will be [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=123.54s)]
*  rigorously implemented. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=125.62s)]
*  So Judge McConnell argued that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=127.5s)]
*  the Trump administration did not [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  follow his orders and continued [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=131.5s)]
*  moving forward with their federal [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=133.38s)]
*  funding freeze, even though he had [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=135.38s)]
*  temporarily blocked it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=137.34s)]
*  On Friday, the Coalition of 22 [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=138.98s)]
*  states alleged that despite [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=141.0s)]
*  McConnell's ruling, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=142.88s)]
*  the Trump administration was in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=144.12s)]
*  fact still withholding federal [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=145.78s)]
*  funds. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=147.48s)]
*  The state said in a court filing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=148.2s)]
*  that still frozen funds included [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=150.04s)]
*  about $7 billion in grant money for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=152.04s)]
*  solar panels and $5 billion that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=154.2s)]
*  supports greenhouse gas [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=156.28s)]
*  reduction measures. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=157.96s)]
*  Again, this was money that was [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=160.0s)]
*  allocated by Congress. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=161.8s)]
*  They have the power of the purse. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=163.36s)]
*  The executive branch is not [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=165.16s)]
*  supposed to unilaterally block that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=166.84s)]
*  money from going to where it is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=169.04s)]
*  intended to go. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=170.84s)]
*  By the way, this is obviously [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=172.32s)]
*  setting a terrible precedent [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=173.78s)]
*  because what if Republicans have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=175.16s)]
*  passed legislation that they want, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=176.88s)]
*  and it provides funding for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=178.84s)]
*  organizations or [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  projects that they want. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  And a Democratic executive branch [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=183.4s)]
*  says, nah, we don't like it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=185.2s)]
*  We're not going to do it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  We're going to put a freeze on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=188.12s)]
*  that money, okay? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=189.24s)]
*  So if you're celebrating what [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=190.28s)]
*  Trump is doing now, understand [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=191.84s)]
*  Democrats could do the same thing, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=193.44s)]
*  and we don't want that situation, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=195.12s)]
*  right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=196.76s)]
*  In a court filing Sunday, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=197.68s)]
*  Justice Department lawyers said [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=199.04s)]
*  the Trump administration had made [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=200.92s)]
*  good faith, diligent efforts to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  comply with McConnell's earlier [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=204.6s)]
*  ruling. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=206.6s)]
*  They said the funds at issue were [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=207.12s)]
*  frozen because of a Trump executive [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=209.12s)]
*  order signed hours after he was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=211.4s)]
*  sworn in that paused tens of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=213.32s)]
*  billions of dollars in federal [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=215.32s)]
*  climate spending. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=217.32s)]
*  So they're arguing, no, no, no, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  no, we're following through. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=220.6s)]
*  It's just that there was another [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  executive order, and we continued [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  freezing funding for projects [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=226.4s)]
*  having to do with climate related [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=228.24s)]
*  priorities, okay? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  But so the Justice Department under [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=231.6s)]
*  Trump is saying, no, no, we try. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=233.64s)]
*  We made a good faith effort to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  follow through on what you ordered [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=237.48s)]
*  us to do. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  It's just that there was some [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  confusion here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=241.6s)]
*  The administration reasonably [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=242.64s)]
*  interpreted the temporary [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=244.56s)]
*  restraining order not to extend to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=246.2s)]
*  that executive order, which wasn't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=248.28s)]
*  challenged as part of the lawsuit [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  according to the Justice Department. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=252.32s)]
*  Yeah, the judge is not buying that, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=254.48s)]
*  but at least they're trying to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=256.2s)]
*  pretend to follow the order, which [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=257.76s)]
*  is important because if they just [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=259.64000000000004s)]
*  said go pound sand, then we got [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  a constitutional crisis. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  Because the executive branch must [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=265.20000000000005s)]
*  listen to the judicial branch. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=267.12s)]
*  If they don't, we have no law and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=268.8s)]
*  order at all. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=270.88s)]
*  And so now, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=272.56s)]
*  what's the right way to do it? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=273.56s)]
*  Easy, at this point, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=276.12s)]
*  Republicans have the White House, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=277.6s)]
*  the House and the Senate. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=280.32000000000005s)]
*  So if you don't like this spending [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  that was already passed, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=284.24s)]
*  that's too late. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=285.56s)]
*  That's the law, it's the law. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=286.32000000000005s)]
*  Do Republicans care about the law [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=288.68s)]
*  at all anymore? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  It's a good open question. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  So okay, now you go and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=293.24s)]
*  you don't like that funding, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=294.64s)]
*  you won. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=296.52s)]
*  You have every right to say next [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=297.48s)]
*  time I don't want that funding, and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=299.0s)]
*  you could win because you have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=300.76s)]
*  enough votes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=302.16s)]
*  So now, I don't like that, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=303.56s)]
*  I don't agree with a lot of these [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=304.92s)]
*  decisions, but there's nothing we [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=306.36s)]
*  could do about that, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  you won the election. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  So it's actually super easy for [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=310.0s)]
*  the right wing to cut this funding [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=311.76s)]
*  the right way. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=313.68s)]
*  And especially with Trump being [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=315.32s)]
*  able to bully the politicians, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=316.48s)]
*  not only the right, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=317.76s)]
*  you get some of the Democrats to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  vote for half this stuff, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  So why not do it the right way? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=322.24s)]
*  Why say no, I'm not going to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=325.96s)]
*  listen to the law, I'm going to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=327.8s)]
*  defy what Congress said, and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=329.84s)]
*  now I'm going to defy the judiciary? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=331.76s)]
*  There's only one reason to do that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=334.2s)]
*  is because you want to build up [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=336.12s)]
*  infinite power in the executive [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=337.92s)]
*  branch. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=339.76s)]
*  You want to ignore Congress and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=340.52s)]
*  the courts so that you could do [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=342.68s)]
*  whatever you want. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  And whenever you give that much [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=346.56s)]
*  power to anybody or any office, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=349.04s)]
*  you're going to create tyranny. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=351.68s)]
*  And so if you think in your right [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=355.08s)]
*  wing or you think, good, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=356.72s)]
*  I want to do tyranny against [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=358.04s)]
*  my opponents. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=359.44s)]
*  I want to do tyranny against [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=360.76s)]
*  the woke left, etc. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=362.16s)]
*  You better hope that nobody else [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=364.56s)]
*  gets into power, because you just [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  opened the door for tyranny. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=367.48s)]
*  And don't ever, ever, ever complain [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  to me about tyranny of government. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=370.92s)]
*  If you say the executive branch [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  should be kings and they shouldn't [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=374.84s)]
*  listen to our form of government, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  our democracy, our constitution. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  So just make up your mind, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=381.79999999999995s)]
*  do you love the constitution? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=383.08s)]
*  Do you love this country or [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=384.56s)]
*  don't you? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=385.96s)]
*  because in our constitution, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  we have three branches of government [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=388.12s)]
*  and it's very clear how they work. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=389.96s)]
*  So if Trump continues on this path [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  of saying, I'm not going to listen [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  to Congress or the courts, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=395.64s)]
*  we're all screwed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=397.08s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=398.64s)]
*  allow a next election because this [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  is exactly how tyranny begins. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  When he says there is no more law [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=403.2s)]
*  than what the dear leader says. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJCN4RuFpo&t=404.76s)]
