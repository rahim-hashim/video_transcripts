# Trump Delivers on Promise To Libertarians
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM)
*  If you vote for me on day one, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbrich, who was sentenced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=0.0s)]
*  of time served. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=7.48s)]
*  He's already served 11 years, we're gonna get him home. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=13.4s)]
*  Well it turns out that Donald Trump definitely kept his word to libertarians. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=20.88s)]
*  What you just watched was part of his speech at a libertarian conference during the 2024 [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=26.2s)]
*  presidential election. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=31.16s)]
*  And now he has decided to officially pardon Ross Ulbrich, who is the founder or was the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=32.7s)]
*  founder of Silk Road, an online platform in the black market. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=38.7s)]
*  Now if you don't know what the Silk Road is or who Ross Ulbrich is, we actually covered [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=45.92s)]
*  this story back when it broke many years ago, 11 years ago. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=51.14s)]
*  But just to give you some more details about that, Ulbrich who was known online by the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=56.26s)]
*  pseudonym Dead Pirate Roberts, a reference to the character in the 1987 movie The Princess [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=61.1s)]
*  Bride, created Silk Road in 2011. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=67.18s)]
*  He operated the website until it was shut down by law enforcement authorities in 2013. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=69.9s)]
*  So he did not use this platform to sell drugs or do anything illegal, but the platform was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=76.04s)]
*  used for illegal activity. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  And the currency used was Bitcoin, right? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=87.84s)]
*  In fact, it was the only black market site that relied on Bitcoin in order to fund transactions [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  And so in its two year lifespan, Silk Road was used by more than 100,000 users, $214 [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=98.54s)]
*  million worth of illegal drugs and illicit services were bought and sold on the platform, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  which is how Ulbrich became a target by law enforcement. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=110.0s)]
*  And so prosecutors argued that multiple people died due to drug use that was, drugs that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=115.72s)]
*  were sold on Silk Road. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=122.0s)]
*  And there were also allegations that there were murder solicitations of those who posed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=124.44s)]
*  a threat to Ulbrich. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=133.0s)]
*  Although it's important to note that there was no evidence that any murders were actually [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=135.11999999999998s)]
*  carried out. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=139.64s)]
*  Ulbrich was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 after being convicted on seven counts, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  including conspiracy and money laundering related to the anonymous marketplace website [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=147.88s)]
*  he created that was used to sell drugs and illegal goods. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  According to Ulbrich, the Silk Road was not made to seek financial gain, but he believed [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=157.56s)]
*  that people should have the right to buy and sell whatever they wanted as long as they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=163.6s)]
*  weren't hurting anyone else. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=167.82s)]
*  And at the time, now former US District Judge Catherine Forrest said in sentencing him, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=170.16s)]
*  again, life in prison, that was a sentence. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=175.6s)]
*  What you did was unprecedented and in breaking that ground as the first person, you sit here [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=178.52s)]
*  the defendant having to pay the consequences for that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=184.76s)]
*  And so as you saw in the first video we showed Trump promised that he would pardon Ulbrich [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=188.96s)]
*  and actually follow through on that promise. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=194.6s)]
*  So he said in announcing the pardon, I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbrich to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=197.02s)]
*  let her know that in honor of her and the libertarian movement, which supported me so [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=202.16s)]
*  strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=209.28s)]
*  her son Ross. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=214.12s)]
*  Then he followed that with the scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=216.2s)]
*  who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  Were they? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=227.12s)]
*  Anyway, he continues, he was given, this is true by the way, this part, he was given two [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=228.12s)]
*  life sentences plus 40 years, ridiculous. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  And that last part I agree with, look, I think that the life sentence was insane. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=235.76s)]
*  And so I'm actually happy that Trump pardoned him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=243.42s)]
*  That was very heavy handed. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=246.32s)]
*  Look, obviously we don't think the selling of drugs for the most part is, I mean, I don't [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=247.72s)]
*  know where you kept out in terms of which drugs and you could sell potentially anything on [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=251.6s)]
*  here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=255.0s)]
*  It wasn't like a marijuana dealership or whatever. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=256.0s)]
*  But you could sell guns as well and there was allegations of human trafficking and the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=257.0s)]
*  hiring of hit men and you could sell anything. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=262.44s)]
*  The issue was it's anonymous and they're specifically using Bitcoin, which is also basically untraceable. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=264.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=269.64s)]
*  So he was setting up kind of the perfect place for contraband black market illegal goods. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=270.64s)]
*  And so we don't know exactly what could have been done with the weapons that were sold [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=276.12s)]
*  on there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=278.56s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=279.56s)]
*  I don't think the drug stuff is all that serious. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I probably don't want it being on the dark web. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  I would prefer that it's a storefront that seems safer for everyone involved. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=286.32s)]
*  But I know that Donald Trump thinks it's serious. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=291.12s)]
*  He has repeatedly over and over and over and over and over said that the way that you [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=293.28s)]
*  deal with drug dealers is you shoot them in the head. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=296.67999999999995s)]
*  Okay, this is the interesting part of this story. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=299.23999999999995s)]
*  Okay, so look, I agree with the pardon. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=301.55999999999995s)]
*  That's not as interesting as just how transactional Trump is. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so Trump goes to the Libertarian Conference. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=309.11999999999995s)]
*  If you remember that, he was booed like Libertarians don't necessarily like or favor Trump. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=313.44s)]
*  But he made that promise during that conference. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  And since he got sizable support from Libertarian voters in this past election cycle, he followed [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=323.48s)]
*  through on his promise. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=330.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=331.08s)]
*  He doesn't have any real principles. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=332.08s)]
*  And that's both a bad thing, but also potentially a good thing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=334.76s)]
*  So if you're willing to make a deal with Trump, he will at least attempt to carry out a policy [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=338.92s)]
*  or a pardon that you want. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=345.56s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=347.92s)]
*  So when I saw this, cuz I vaguely remembered Silk Road. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=348.92s)]
*  It was a long time ago and I don't super remember. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=351.76s)]
*  So I was like, I assume this is like a Snowden thing or something, right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=354.0s)]
*  He didn't actually do it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=359.56s)]
*  The government made it up or like and so I looked into it and I was like, no, he did [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=362.16s)]
*  it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  Like the Libertarians, I thought it was like how, Snowden's got people who to this day [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  are like, you'll free him or free other people that have whistle blue or whatever. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  So it's like a principled thing where they never should have been locked up. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=377.04s)]
*  They didn't actually commit a crime, but he did. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  He just did. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=382.12s)]
*  This would be like if, I don't know, my go to comparison would be like if Harris needed [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  some support. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=389.88s)]
*  So she was like, there's this person who killed a cop at a BLM riot. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=390.88s)]
*  So I'm like, I'll let him free, I guess or whatever and then do that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  Although that is now in vogue with Donald Trump. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=397.04s)]
*  But it's exactly like that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=399.6s)]
*  He broke the law, we know he did. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=401.42s)]
*  And he's just letting him out in exchange for political support. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=404.12s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=407.2s)]
*  Even going against his often cited thing where we should kill drug dealers because what they're [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=408.2s)]
*  doing is so serious. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=411.44s)]
*  And like I was almost like maybe Trump is being principled here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  But this is just, Donald Trump, you could say he has no principles, that's part of it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=416.4s)]
*  I also think he's proving in the first days of his presidency, he's a criminal's best [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=420.28s)]
*  friend. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=424.32s)]
*  Law and order is done. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=425.32s)]
*  It's a lawless, it's a transactional lawless society. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=426.32s)]
*  It's personalities, it's transact, it's not actual laws. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=430.64s)]
*  It's not an actual constitution. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=433.36s)]
*  He's a criminal's best friend, he's violent criminal's best friend, he's attempted murderers [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=434.36s)]
*  best friends. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=438.64s)]
*  That's what he is, you can rely on him. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=440.16s)]
*  If you commit the right sorts of crimes, the right sorts of beatings and murders and all [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=442.0s)]
*  that, then he will have your back. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=444.92s)]
*  Look, I have no problem with the website being shut down. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  The website was facilitating illegal activity, including activity that very likely got people [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=450.76s)]
*  hurt, okay? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=457.0s)]
*  So I'm not at all justifying that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=458.0s)]
*  But I do have a problem with someone getting a life sentence in prison for simply having [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=461.44s)]
*  a website that facilitates the behavior that other people are engaging in. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=465.64s)]
*  Especially when you consider the fact that like, did the Sackler family get a life sentence? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=470.28s)]
*  Well, you don't have to convince me that they should have a life sentence, yeah. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=474.48s)]
*  How many hundreds of thousands of Americans have died from opioid overdoses because of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=478.04s)]
*  the Sacklers? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=484.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, they did worse. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=485.48s)]
*  So our justice system is pretty gross because there are moneyed interests that get away [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=486.88s)]
*  with murder, literally. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=493.68s)]
*  And then this guy who really didn't have any power did get caught as the person who was [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=495.56s)]
*  running this website. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=501.4s)]
*  And should he have been punished to some extent? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=503.44s)]
*  Sure, but a life sentence? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=506.12s)]
*  Insane. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I have no idea. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  My fear here is there's the transactional thing of giving a political group back what [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=510.52s)]
*  they want. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=514.96s)]
*  I'm also worried about going forward the transactional thing of this guy potentially has maybe a [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=515.96s)]
*  fortune of Bitcoin waiting for him now that he's out there. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=521.0s)]
*  Donald Trump now has his own thing where untraceable massive sums of money can be transferred to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  him. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=529.0400000000001s)]
*  80% of it goes to him. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=530.0400000000001s)]
*  We have no idea. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=531.0400000000001s)]
*  This guy could give him $300 million for all we know. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=532.08s)]
*  Maybe they talked beforehand. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=536.72s)]
*  But that's the era we live in, I don't know. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=537.72s)]
*  Isn't that the American way? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=539.6s)]
*  It is now the American way, yes. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=541.12s)]
*  And I find that deeply worrying. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=543.12s)]
*  Well, it is refreshing to see some instances of a politician actually falling through this [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=545.64s)]
*  promise. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=551.04s)]
*  I wish we had that on the Democratic side, but we don't. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=552.88s)]
*  So- Free our prisoners. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=556.68s)]
*  No, Democrats are really good at freeing prisoners. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=559.0s)]
*  They excel at that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=562.8s)]
*  Imagine the next one, like AOC needs youth voters. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=563.8s)]
*  She's like, Luigi? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=568.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's out. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=569.0s)]
*  Whatever, it doesn't matter. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=570.0s)]
*  You vote for me, and you did, so I let him out. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=571.8399999999999s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=575.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=576.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=577.36s)]
*  The AOC, I just gave you an idea. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=578.36s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=579.36s)]
*  You wanna win that primary? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8l-dP7qIHM&t=580.36s)]
