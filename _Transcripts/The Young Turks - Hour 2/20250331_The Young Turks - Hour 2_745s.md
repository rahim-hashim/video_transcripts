On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Joe Rogan on Socialized Healthcare
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o)
*  Why are you out with healthcare? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=0.0s)]
*  I think healthcare 100% should be socially funded. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=2.02s)]
*  I think that Medicare and Medicaid having programs where people who are hurt can get [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=7.58s)]
*  an operation and it's not going to bankrupt them for the rest of their life is another [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=13.56s)]
*  thing that I think society should be, it should be a part of our agreement to take care of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=17.6s)]
*  each other as a community. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=23.88s)]
*  So we chip in money for what people would think of as socialist positions. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=25.54s)]
*  That is a smoking position, almost as smoking as the joint that they have on set. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=30.82s)]
*  That was Joe Rogan, of course, and he's been going to bat for socialized healthcare. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=36.66s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=41.58s)]
*  He's done it more than once in the past month alone. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=42.58s)]
*  Are you shocked by that, Jake? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=46.06s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=47.58s)]
*  He endorsed Bernie Sanders. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  Look, I got super frustrated with Rogan when he was on the tear against LGBTQ community, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=50.13999999999999s)]
*  in my opinion. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=57.419999999999995s)]
*  He started talking about the groomers and- [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=58.419999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you wanted to fight him over it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I hated that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, physically. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=64.34s)]
*  I couldn't stand that, right? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=65.34s)]
*  And then I didn't like the gaslighting of he's not a majority on the right. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=66.34s)]
*  Now, of course, he's majority on the right. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=69.74s)]
*  These days he voted for Trump, right? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=71.34s)]
*  But I also don't like the gaslighting of, no, he's a Trump cultist. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=73.1s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=78.66s)]
*  Look at him objecting on sending the innocent guy to El Salvador, and you can go on and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=80.06s)]
*  on. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=86.3s)]
*  And if he was a Trump cultist all along, why did he endorse Bernie in 2016? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=87.3s)]
*  So it just doesn't make any sense. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=92.06s)]
*  I don't like either side gaslighting, right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=93.18s)]
*  So what is Rogan? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=96.06s)]
*  He's independent. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=98.14s)]
*  These days he has more right-wing opinions than left-wing opinions. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=100.22s)]
*  But does he have some strong left-wing opinions? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=103.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=105.58s)]
*  Does he actually care about right or left-wing? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=106.58s)]
*  No, not really, not too much. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=108.94s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=111.14s)]
*  So he doesn't view the world in that way, and I know a lot of us do. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=112.3s)]
*  And then some of us get really mad over, no, you're on the wrong wing, etc. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=115.46s)]
*  And it's okay, you could fight him on the things that you disagree with. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=119.38s)]
*  I challenge him to a physical fight over the things that I disagree with him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=122.06s)]
*  So I'm pretty clear on that issue. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=126.18s)]
*  But here, I will take yes for an answer. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=128.14s)]
*  Yeah, look, if you're a political junkie, you're likely obsessed with an individual's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=131.17999999999998s)]
*  label, right? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=138.1s)]
*  Is this person left or right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=139.22s)]
*  Go talk to a normie about politics, and they're all over the place on what their preferences [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=141.66s)]
*  are on political issues. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=145.98s)]
*  And so Joe Rogan is not a political figure, he's not a political analyst. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=147.42s)]
*  His podcast is not simply about politics. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=151.7s)]
*  He's just a regular guy who's curious about things and has all sorts of guests on and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  talks about all sorts of things, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  He's not thinking about it as deeply as you think he's thinking about it, in a political [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=160.7s)]
*  label sense. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  First of all, that's true in terms of he doesn't really care too much about labels, etc. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  But also, he's not sitting there strategizing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  So people think, he's gonna go and say this so that he could actually win on the anti-trans [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=175.26s)]
*  agenda or whatever. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=180.82s)]
*  I got news for you, most people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=181.82s)]
*  No, he's mainly getting high and then talking to a bunch of friends. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=182.82s)]
*  And does he talk to too many right wingers, which then influences him more in a right [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=186.54s)]
*  wing direction? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=190.18s)]
*  I think so, right? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=191.18s)]
*  Yeah, but that's okay. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=192.18s)]
*  The answer to that is talk to more left wingers or independents or whoever the hell you like, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=193.18s)]
*  right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=197.22s)]
*  But who are you canceling anyway? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=198.22s)]
*  The guy's got the largest podcast. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=200.22s)]
*  Remember they were all gonna cancel Rogan, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=201.94s)]
*  How is he supposed to talk to left wingers when if a left winger goes on that show, they [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  get totally destroyed for doing so? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  I mean, Bernie Sanders running for president in 2020 was absolutely skewered by the left [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=210.78s)]
*  for having the audacity to talk to the man who hosts the most popular podcast in the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=217.38000000000002s)]
*  country at the time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=222.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that was at the height of the cancel culture. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=223.26000000000002s)]
*  And yes, there was both establishment Democrats and other folks on the left who are like, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=226.18s)]
*  no, Rogan has some unacceptable opinions. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  So Bernie talking to him is unacceptable. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  He should be canceled. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=235.94s)]
*  Take yes for an answer, brother, which Bernie, as we're about to show you, does. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=236.94s)]
*  But get to the point of Rogan's actual policy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=242.78s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=246.42s)]
*  I mean, he uses an analogy that I use in my book about the fire department. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=247.42s)]
*  Okay, so let's get to that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=250.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=251.5s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=252.5s)]
*  I always bring up the fire department because the fire department is one of the best examples [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=253.5s)]
*  that everybody sort of agrees. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=255.74s)]
*  It's a socialist sort of thing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=257.82s)]
*  You give your tax dollars, the tax dollar supports the fire department. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=259.92s)]
*  The fire department fairly puts out fires for everybody. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=263.62s)]
*  They don't not put out your fire if you don't have any money. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=266.9s)]
*  It's not like they don't, the fires don't. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=270.02s)]
*  Such a good example. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=271.94s)]
*  But when you compare that to the way that medical access is done, at least in this country. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't think most people realize we're a mixed economy, right? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  We're not socialist, we're not fully capitalist. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=284.56s)]
*  We have certain programs in this country, whether it's on a state and local level or [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=287.44s)]
*  federal level, where it's socialized. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay, Medicaid is a socialized program. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=294.0s)]
*  Social security, socialized. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=297.24s)]
*  Medicare, socialized. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=298.88s)]
*  And so we have private industry, obviously. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=300.74s)]
*  We have private companies, they're able to function and operate the way they do. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  We have markets. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=306.34s)]
*  But it makes sense to have certain areas of our society socialized, so there isn't as [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=307.82s)]
*  much of a profit motive, right? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=314.28s)]
*  So the priority is to provide the best service or care. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=316.26s)]
*  So another good example is private prisons, where you literally have investors, you have [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=320.34s)]
*  shareholders, okay? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=326.26s)]
*  You have a board, and you are looking to maximize profits. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=327.38s)]
*  That is a perverse incentive, because obviously you're going to want to criminalize as many [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=331.62s)]
*  human actions or human behaviors as possible to maximize your profits. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=336.54s)]
*  Then you have publicly run prisons, they're not great, but there isn't a profit motive [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=340.74s)]
*  and you don't have a fiduciary responsibility to return on investment to your shareholders. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=345.26s)]
*  Yeah, so let's expand on the fire department as I did in Justice is Coming. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=350.74s)]
*  So in the old days we had private fire departments and they wouldn't put out a fire if you didn't [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=354.42s)]
*  have insurance. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=358.7s)]
*  The problem is fire spread. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=359.7s)]
*  Same thing with viruses and with medical conditions, etc. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=361.06s)]
*  So that's one of the many reasons why you need to socialize health insurance, not the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=365.12s)]
*  doctors themselves. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  And Rogan went on a long rant about how he wants the best doctors possible. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=373.18s)]
*  And he's not wrong about that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=377.38s)]
*  You can keep the entire system private except for the insurance, which is what the great [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=380.46s)]
*  majority of countries do and every developed nation other than us does. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=385.29999999999995s)]
*  They have the insurance public or socialized and that gets to one of my main complaints. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=389.12s)]
*  In this case, the number one culprit is not right wing or left wing media, it's mainstream [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=393.7s)]
*  media. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=398.06s)]
*  Because in my whole life they've never explained what socialism is and they've never explained [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=399.17999999999995s)]
*  what a mixed economy is. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=403.17999999999995s)]
*  They just allow corporate politicians on both sides to call anything that helps the American [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=404.62s)]
*  people socialism, right? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=410.18s)]
*  It's absurd, that's not true at all. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=412.5s)]
*  And like Ana said, we have a mixed economy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=414.1s)]
*  Sneakers and jeans and burgers should be done by private corporations. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=416.78000000000003s)]
*  And things like fire department, police department, things that protect your life and health insurance [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=420.78000000000003s)]
*  needs to be done by the public. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=425.5s)]
*  Otherwise you'll have a profit motive to literally kill people. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=427.74s)]
*  Because those are your costs, taking care of people are your costs. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=431.54s)]
*  You wanna minimize your costs, so you wanna deny as much as possible. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=434.88s)]
*  It's a death machine. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=438.62s)]
*  It's insane that we allow it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=439.96s)]
*  No other developed nation on earth allows it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=441.56s)]
*  So what Rogan is saying is total common sense. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=444.28s)]
*  By the way, Chris Williamson, another guy whose show that we've both been on, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=446.52s)]
*  Another guy saying, yeah, the left is totally right about this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=450.56s)]
*  And of course this should be a universal healthcare, I love it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=454.32s)]
*  So in areas where you find common ground with individuals who are to the right of you or [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  just full blown right wingers, I would say take the win. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=465.06s)]
*  You can definitely work together in areas where you have common ground. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=468.97999999999996s)]
*  Because look guys, fact of the matter is most people don't agree 100% on everything, right? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=473.79999999999995s)]
*  So if you can build alliances on specific issues to push government to go in the right [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=478.58s)]
*  direction, I say go for it, take the win. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=484.0s)]
*  Now I wanna go to one other clip, okay? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=487.0s)]
*  Because in a podcast episode a week earlier, Rogan again argued in favor of socialized [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=489.76s)]
*  healthcare and even voice support for other economically populist ideas. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=495.28s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=501.11999999999995s)]
*  This is very controversial, but socialized medicine. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=501.88s)]
*  The idea that you should go broke because you broke your leg is crazy. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=505.32s)]
*  If we're a community of people that are supposed to be supporting each other and helping each [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=509.21999999999997s)]
*  other, the best thing we could do is help one of the members of community become active [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=512.76s)]
*  and productive and contribute to society. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=518.56s)]
*  That makes everybody better and greater and we should be willing to contribute to that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=522.18s)]
*  I believe in competition and I believe in merit and I think it's very, very important [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=525.68s)]
*  for our society as a whole. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=529.48s)]
*  But I also think there should be a much larger safety net for individuals so they don't go [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=532.12s)]
*  broke if they have a knee surgery. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=536.28s)]
*  Or if you break your back, you shouldn't have to go bankrupt. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=539.0s)]
*  That's kind of crazy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=542.28s)]
*  And I think labor unions are very important. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  It's very important to not allow a corporation that is entirely designed to make as much [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=548.34s)]
*  money as possible dictate how much money its workers get. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=557.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, my mind kind of goes back to the whole we need to find a Joe Rogan of [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=561.34s)]
*  the left. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=567.1s)]
*  And I think that that mindset just fundamentally misses the point. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=569.34s)]
*  The reason why someone like Rogan has brought appeal is that he's not really a hack for [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=574.92s)]
*  anyone or any side. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=580.3s)]
*  He's a curious person. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=582.24s)]
*  He's sincere about what he thinks. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=583.84s)]
*  I disagree with him on some stuff. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=586.1999999999999s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I do believe he believes everything he's saying. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=588.26s)]
*  He's not putting on a show. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=591.88s)]
*  He's not trying to appease one side or the other. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=593.38s)]
*  And that's why he's popular. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=595.8s)]
*  He has interesting conversations with interesting people. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=596.8s)]
*  Sometimes I don't like the people he's talking to, but whatever, it doesn't matter. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  It's still a provocative enough conversation that people wanna tune in. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=603.26s)]
*  Yeah, and so look, last two things here. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=607.7s)]
*  We showed you that Media Matters chart last week that shows that TYT network is about [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=611.72s)]
*  half of the online left, right? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=616.6s)]
*  And then people still go, we need a left-wing Joe Rogan. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=619.44s)]
*  And so then why do they say that, right? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=622.9s)]
*  Because when they come and look at our network, they go, yeah, but you guys are not controllable. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=625.72s)]
*  We just want you to say the Democrats are great. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=631.6999999999999s)]
*  But that's not what a left-wing Joe Rogan would say, right? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=634.62s)]
*  You don't get to have the popularity of Joe Rogan, or by the way of TYT, and control the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=638.3399999999999s)]
*  message and just do propaganda for one party or another. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=643.62s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=648.12s)]
*  So snap out of it, people in the establishment. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=649.7399999999999s)]
*  Okay, and by the way, again, to Ana's point, there was a Joe Rogan of the left. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=652.5799999999999s)]
*  It was Joe Rogan when he endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2016. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=656.6999999999999s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=660.18s)]
*  The left hated, or not all of it, by the way, but some portion of the left hated that Bernie [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=661.52s)]
*  went on, canceled Bernie and Rogan. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=665.82s)]
*  How did that turn out for us? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=668.7s)]
*  Great, it turned out great. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=669.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=671.42s)]
*  Now Bernie, by the way, has weighed in on the latest comments from Joe Rogan. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=672.42s)]
*  And he's a man of many words. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=676.94s)]
*  Joe Rogan is absolutely right about this. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=679.78s)]
*  Yeah, will he get canceled over? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=681.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=684.62s)]
*  Anyway, hey, there's still some of those folks out there. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=685.62s)]
*  We asked this, Paul, I'm curious how you guys answer. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=687.94s)]
*  I'm a little worried about looking at it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=689.98s)]
*  They're about to put it on screen. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=691.74s)]
*  We just have three stories in a row where Joe Rogan is against Trump's policies. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=693.62s)]
*  Okay, will Joe Rogan always support Donald Trump no matter what? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=697.22s)]
*  The 2024 Gallup poll found that 62% of Americans say government should ensure health coverage [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=700.74s)]
*  for all in the United States. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=708.26s)]
*  And by the way, that's 62%, right? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=710.7s)]
*  Universal healthcare, I've seen it as high as 70%, but I'll take it. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=712.3000000000001s)]
*  What does everyone in mainstream media say? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=715.9s)]
*  Very unpopular, radical left policy, socialism, socialism. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=718.18s)]
*  So mainstream media on economic issues is massively, and I don't even know if at this [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=722.9399999999999s)]
*  point it's fair to even call them right wing or conservative. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=727.6999999999999s)]
*  They're just corporatists, right? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=730.8199999999999s)]
*  And they're like, the beloved health insurance corporations must be protected above all. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=731.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay, we see you. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuIPdKFj-7o&t=737.0999999999999s)]
