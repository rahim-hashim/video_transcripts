"Fox News host Sean Hannity turned his fire on Republicans, warning conservatives that raising taxes on America‚Äôs wealthiest was ‚Äúbad‚Äù and ‚Äúagainst everything‚Äù President Donald Trump was elected on.

A new Bloomberg report on Wednesday revealed that Republicans in the White House and on Capitol Hill are eyeing a proposal to raise the top income tax rate from 37% to 40% for Americans earning over $1 million annually."

# Hannity Practically WEEPS At Notion Of Raising Taxes On Rich
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM)
*  I just think it's bad for the economy. On the other hand, it seems to go against everything [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has ever believed in. I mean, I think he's always understood this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=5.2s)]
*  And I've been reading the same things you've been reading and frankly, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=10.0s)]
*  I just haven't been believing it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=13.36s)]
*  Yeah, Sean Hannity, they're absolutely horrified at the notion that President [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=14.64s)]
*  Donald Trump could let taxes rise on the wealthy. Yes, he's not the only Republican who's unhappy [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=21.36s)]
*  with the idea. And before we get to them, Cenk, are you surprised that this is the one Trump [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=28.48s)]
*  policy that Hannity cannot get behind and he's being incredibly vocal about it? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=33.92s)]
*  Yeah, so I wanna break down all the tax policies because God, there's a massive misinformation here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=40.32s)]
*  But no, I am not at all surprised that Sean Hannity finally defies Donald Trump [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=48.08s)]
*  when it's tax cuts for the rich. He's like, no, the whole board of the Republican Party [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=55.52s)]
*  is tax cuts for billionaires like me. Okay, yeah, that's what we thought, Sean, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=61.36s)]
*  cry more, bitch. Anyway, let's tell you the rest of the story. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=65.84s)]
*  I need that on a t-shirt. Okay, as we discussed on Wednesday, Trump is open to letting taxes [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=69.12s)]
*  increase on the rich rather than including them in the massive tax cuts that Republicans want to pass. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Two sources familiar with the discussions told Fox News Digital that the White House [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  aides have been quietly floating a proposal to House Republicans that would raise the tax rate [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  for people making more than 1 million to 40%. But Hannity and economist Steve Moore think that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  could be a really bad political strategy. Let's watch. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=102.88s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna happen, but it's a threat. And we've got, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  you know, my old friend Bob Novak, you remember Bob Novak from Evans and Novak, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=110.8s)]
*  he used to say the only reason God put Republicans on the Earth is to cut our taxes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  And if they're raising them, I think it's gonna split our party. I think Republicans will lose [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  the midterm elections. Don't go there. You remember what happened in 1992. Remember when [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=123.35999999999999s)]
*  Bush raised taxes, we lost everything. Right, pretty unbelievable to be honest. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=128.72s)]
*  What Republicans would go forward with a tax increase when they should be making the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=135.92s)]
*  Trump tax cuts permanent, eliminating tax on tips, social security and overtime? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  Because that's what the president promised. Why would they go in any other direction? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=148.16s)]
*  Is it just me or does Sean Hannity sound like he's been up all night worrying about this? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it just sounds off. He's really upset about this. Yesterday, MSNBC brought on Mark Short, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  the former chief of staff or VP Mike Pence to give his thoughts on Taxi the Rich. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=163.36s)]
*  You can probably guess what he had to say. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that where we were in 2017 was a pretty conservative free market approach to pro growth [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  policies. I think what you see now is the latest shift toward populism inside the party where [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=178.0s)]
*  there are probably some who think this polls well. I think it's terrible economics. I think [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  it's terrible policy. But I think there's no doubt that there's parts in the White House that are [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=186.0s)]
*  pushing Congress to adapt this. And I think, as you said, it's a juggling act as to how you get to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=190.56s)]
*  the deficit numbers they're trying to get. I think ultimately, there's probably more [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=196.24s)]
*  effort inside the House to try to find cuts there on the Senate. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=201.36s)]
*  On Medicaid, Ali, if you don't appreciate that, when we passed tax reform in 2017, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=204.48s)]
*  there were about 51 million Americans on Medicaid. Today, it's about 78 million. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=208.96s)]
*  That's an enormous growth. And we're not being honest American people if we just say we're not [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=213.2s)]
*  gonna touch it at all. Now, the Republicans that support or are open to tax hikes on the rich include [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=217.2s)]
*  President Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, another one, Senator Josh Hawley, House Freedom Chair [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  Andy Harris, Republicans that have come out against tax hikes on the rich include Senator Ted Cruz, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=234.72s)]
*  House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and one Mike Pence. So jump in, Cenk. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=242.4s)]
*  You first. Does anything here surprise you? And it's that last thing that Mark Short said that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  it's time to be honest with people. We've gotta touch Medicare. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So, okay, let's break this down. First of all, Sean Hannity said, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=259.76s)]
*  this will split the party. This is a tank. This is going from 37% to 40%. So that's 3%. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=267.04s)]
*  And only for people making over a million dollars. Is half the Republican Party millionaires? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=275.52s)]
*  And that's why it's gonna split it? And no, the Republican Party these days [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  is filled with people who are making a lot less. And so it's not the Republican voters they care [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=288.08s)]
*  about. It's the Republican power players, the politicians, the donors, the elites of the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=295.52s)]
*  Republican Party. They love tax cuts for the rich cuz they're all rich and all their donors are rich. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=301.52s)]
*  So now look at this trick and then I'm gonna come to Mark Short. So if the Trump tax cuts expire, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=307.6s)]
*  the tax rate for people making above $600 some odd thousand dollars is gonna go from 37 to 39.6. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=315.6s)]
*  So that would affect the millionaires cuz they're above $600,000 anyway, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=324.88s)]
*  So if the Trump tax cuts go away, this so-called tax increase on the rich or on millionaires [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  is irrelevant, totally irrelevant. So it's a trick in the first place. They're not actually [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=335.6s)]
*  gonna raise taxes on the rich. So what they're doing is they're keeping all of the other tax [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=342.48s)]
*  cuts for the rich and for corporations, but just making an 3% exception for millionaires [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=347.44s)]
*  at the top of the bracket. So that's microscopic. It's meant to trick you into thinking we're real [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  populist and we're going after the rich. But even that 3 measly percent for millionaires [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=361.44s)]
*  gets Sean Hannity and Mark Short and the entire Republican establishment livid, livid, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=368.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ with their greed. So Mark Short's a guy that I supported when he was defending Mike [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=377.2s)]
*  Pence during January 6 because Trump supporters were chanting hang Mike Pence, hang Mike Pence. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=382.96s)]
*  So when Mark Short was saying, hey, maybe we shouldn't murder the vice president, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=390.48s)]
*  hey, maybe we shouldn't murder the vice president, I agreed with him, okay? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=394.56s)]
*  But that extends to nothing else. So when now he says, hey, you know what? These poor, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=398.72s)]
*  poor millionaires, an extra 3% to the poor millionaires, we should cut Medicaid instead. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=406.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I thought. That's what I thought. And that's exactly what they're going to try to do, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=413.68s)]
*  by the way. No matter how much lipstick they put on this pig, it's still going to be at least [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=418.4s)]
*  $5 trillion in tax cuts, the overwhelming majority of which are going to go to corporations [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=426.79999999999995s)]
*  and the richest people on earth. And these sons of bitches are so greedy [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=432.79999999999995s)]
*  that they're still complaining about 3%. Right. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=437.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. I mean, there wouldn't be a play here if there weren't some kind of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=443.44s)]
*  catch. And so when I heard about this, I was like, well, this really isn't going to affect [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=449.92s)]
*  the people who we think are going to be affected. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=457.68s)]
*  Because there's this sort of off with their heads sort of mentality that people get in their minds [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=460.56s)]
*  when it comes to we're just going to raise taxes for millionaires. But it's much more nuanced [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=467.28s)]
*  again, and it's a thinner slice of the pie. And I think on the economic issues, these are the issues [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=474.64s)]
*  that can really hurt Trump and his administration if they screw that up, that piece. See, he can [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  toy with constitutional issues because they're so complicated. And the immigration issue is [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=490.23999999999995s)]
*  complicated. And they're trying to muddy the waters with this and their propaganda. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=496.0s)]
*  But the economy is different. Who's paying the taxes, who's paying their fair share? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=500.56s)]
*  And the media can, I feel like that's more of a slam dunk in terms of taking him down. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=507.28s)]
*  And so I think this is a catch. I think this is a game. And I just don't know what the end game [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=515.2s)]
*  in Congress is for the House to be debating this because it exposes fractures. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=522.32s)]
*  And I wonder if Trump is just doing this out of self preservation. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=530.72s)]
*  Yeah, no, of course, of course, of course, of course. So let me break that down because [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=536.0s)]
*  the entire tax bill is where the rubber hits the road and it's going to be really interesting. So [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  they say, well, look, yeah, we're gonna cut taxes on the rich by about $5.5 trillion, right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=549.76s)]
*  But don't worry because we're gonna add tax cuts for people who are getting tips and for people on [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=554.96s)]
*  Social Security and these other categories. And then on top of that, they're saying, no, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=563.36s)]
*  no, Medicaid, we're not gonna cut Medicaid. Don't be ridiculous, right? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=570.0s)]
*  So and then overall, the Doge cuts. Well, but Doge cuts were at a maximum of $130 billion. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=573.52s)]
*  And if they do give Golden Dome to Elon's SpaceX, that's gonna be like 100 times that number, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=579.5999999999999s)]
*  right? So they saved absolutely nothing from Doge. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=588.24s)]
*  And so that's what they were doing all these things. The tariffs are gonna give us an extra [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=591.68s)]
*  $6 trillion. Doge is gonna get to save trillions of dollars. The gold card is gonna create [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=595.28s)]
*  trillions of dollars. These are all excuses they have set up to put another giant, at a bare minimum, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=600.48s)]
*  $5 trillion hole in the debt, right? And remember, Trump is the very worst president on [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=608.88s)]
*  debt accumulation. He added over $8 trillion to the debt in just four years. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=616.24s)]
*  And you know what Trump's go-to move was in business? Just borrow as much as you possibly [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=622.24s)]
*  can and then don't pay it. He did six massive bankruptcies. And when asked about it, he'd be [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=628.56s)]
*  like, well, it's good business. You borrow the money and then you don't pay them back. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  But when you're the American government, if we don't pay them back, the dollar crashes, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=637.92s)]
*  the economy crashes. And so we don't have that luxury. He's piling up all of this debt on top [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=642.2399999999999s)]
*  of your heads. And we're all gonna have to pay for it. And when we have to pay the piper, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  guess what the rich people are gonna do? They're gonna be nowhere to be found, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=654.4s)]
*  right? Golly gee, the taxes are higher now. I gotta go to Switzerland. I gotta go here. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=658.0s)]
*  I gotta go there. And they're gonna stick us with the goddamn bill, okay? So especially if you're a [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=663.28s)]
*  right-winger and you cared about the deficit, and I believe you that you cared. I believe that you [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=668.32s)]
*  were lied to by the Sean Hannity's of the world and got you to believe that Republicans care about [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=672.64s)]
*  balancing budgets. You wanna know the last Republican president that balanced the budget? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=676.72s)]
*  Dwight Eisenhower. They don't give a goddamn about balancing the budget. All they care about [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=680.4s)]
*  is cut taxes for the rich. That's why Stephen Moore, the guest on Sean Hannity there was like, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=685.52s)]
*  I remember Bob Novak used to say the whole thing. It's the flight to rich. I know, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=690.4s)]
*  I know, we all know, right? So he's like, how come we're not on our hands and knees for the rich [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=696.56s)]
*  anymore? And over three goddamn percent, okay? So and again, it's a trick because if you get [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  rid of the Trump tax cuts, that 3% exists anyway. So all of this to get to the point, Brian, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=707.76s)]
*  and Sharon. So when they go to pass the budget, people are roughly going to find out what's in [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  the bill. And when they find out that a huge portion is going to more corporate tax cuts, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=725.92s)]
*  and a enormous portion is going to the richest people in the country. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=732.72s)]
*  And yes, they're gonna have to cut Medicaid. And yes, it's still gonna leave at least $4 trillion [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=737.12s)]
*  unaccounted for. What are people gonna do? And so look, and when are Trump voters gonna catch [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=743.44s)]
*  on to the fact that Trump is no different than any other Republican? His whole thing is serve the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=752.24s)]
*  rich, serve the rich, serve the rich. And so in this case, I'd love to give him credit if this [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=758.16s)]
*  plan was real. And you know me, I mean, you just saw yesterday when he said, no, we're not gonna [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=763.92s)]
*  listen to Netanyahu and we're not gonna attack Iran. I gave him a world of credit, right? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=768.48s)]
*  But if he said, for example, no, no, no, this debt's out of control. No, we're gonna make sure [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=773.28s)]
*  that this budget is balanced. So no, I'm not doing any tax cuts for the rich. I'm not doing [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=780.0s)]
*  any corporate tax cuts. And I'm gonna give to the average guy and we're gonna balance the budget. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=785.52s)]
*  Oh my God, I give him all the credit in the world. Everybody could rip my head off. I don't mind [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=789.76s)]
*  as long as he did the right thing, but he's not gonna do the right thing. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=795.28s)]
*  And even for this small little stupid trick, Hannity and all the other rich Republicans [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=799.12s)]
*  are all bent out of shape. And now if you watch Sean Hannity, you know with absolute certainty, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=805.12s)]
*  the only thing he cares about is the rich in this country. And that's not overly surprising [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  given that according to reporting, he makes $45 million a year. He is not on your side. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=816.64s)]
*  He's on his side. I'm always, it's funny, I always think of Barack Obama when he would say, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=825.04s)]
*  the guy lives in a country club. The guy owns the country club. He's not like you. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=830.88s)]
*  I mean, and most recently, and I don't know, you may have spoken about it on the show. I don't [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=839.52s)]
*  know. I hope you did, but he's gilded the Oval Office with all these gold finishes. And he's [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=846.0s)]
*  replaced all of the frames. He hired an interior designer to put these gold appliqu√©s on the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=853.6800000000001s)]
*  fireplace. And I mean, he's turned the Oval into like Saddam's palace. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=859.84s)]
*  It's just, and no offense to anyone from the former regime. I'm just, if you're into gold. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=867.9200000000001s)]
*  But I mean, it's like the message visually screams, I golf, I'm obese because I love delicious food. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=877.52s)]
*  I live in a club. I'm surrounded by gold, but yet I'm one of you. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=890.08s)]
*  Talk about a despotic kind of authoritarian image. It's just so grotesque that folks find connection [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  there. Never mind the underpinnings of our democracy is just based on this [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=908.08s)]
*  objection to grotesque royalty and wealth and that gilded sort of flashiness. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=915.04s)]
*  It's just, even he's gold. He's gold. His skin is gold. I mean, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=922.4s)]
*  we're not. I'm sunburned from working outside in my yard. I mean, he doesn't do that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=933.1999999999999s)]
*  So I wonder, Jake, why can't we connect that he is not a populist? He is not. He's a fraud. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=940.16s)]
*  Yeah, look, unfortunately, I have an answer for that too, which is that the Democrats, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=951.76s)]
*  this is such a layup for them. I mean, they should go uber populist here. They should [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=958.4s)]
*  you know, attack him with everything they have because this is an enormously winning issue. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=965.6s)]
*  The average American versus the millionaires, right? And billionaires. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=970.96s)]
*  So, but the reason historically Democrats don't do that is because all of their donors are [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=975.0400000000001s)]
*  millionaires and billionaires. So their donors get upset and offended when they do quote unquote [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=981.2800000000001s)]
*  class warfare, right? That's what they call it. So that's why every tax cut magically passes [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=987.6s)]
*  with the Democrats in the hallway singing. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=994.64s)]
*  There was nothing we could do. There was nothing we could do. And so whenever they're in office, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=996.72s)]
*  they can't get anything done. And whenever the Republicans are in office, the somehow [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1001.44s)]
*  pass the goalie. Look at that. Another 4 trillion for the rich, another 2 trillion for the rich, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1007.6s)]
*  another 5 trillion from the rich. So if the Democrats block this, I will be shocked, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1011.6800000000001s)]
*  shocked because tax cuts for the rich always pass. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1018.7199999999999s)]
*  And that's because there's fake opposition. So [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1023.5999999999999s)]
*  charms of fake populists, the Democrats are fake opposition. This whole thing is rigged [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1027.28s)]
*  to serve the donor class. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1032.56s)]
*  Mm-hm. Thank you. Yes, you're right. Thank you. I forgot. I forgot. But yeah. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1033.76s)]
*  I will say this. You asked a couple of minutes ago, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1041.36s)]
*  think about when MAGA would catch on and realize that what Trump is and what he's doing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1044.24s)]
*  I do think there's a chance, I'm not saying it's gonna matter, but I think there's a chance [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1051.36s)]
*  that more will catch on because there's that guy, Elon, who's just always hanging around. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1055.2s)]
*  And they're not so keen on him. They don't like him so much. And so I feel like that's the reminder [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1060.32s)]
*  that you're not really for us when people don't necessarily pay attention to the details, the [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1065.76s)]
*  devil in the details of his tax plan and perhaps the messaging and the media. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1072.48s)]
*  And doesn't do the greatest job of breaking it all down about what it's gonna mean for you [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1076.96s)]
*  and your household. But I don't know. That's just me. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchO_z74fqM&t=1081.1200000000001s)]
