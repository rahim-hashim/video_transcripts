The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump's DUMBEST Move Yet???
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks)
*  Ben Jordan, what are they doing all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=0.0s)]
*  this to save money? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=2.64s)]
*  We're going to cut costs and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=4.32s)]
*  give that back to the American [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=5.88s)]
*  corporations. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=7.48s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=8.4s)]
*  I thought it was going back to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=9.4s)]
*  the American taxpayers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=10.44s)]
*  No, all of it is going to go to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  corporate tax cuts, all of it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=12.88s)]
*  Trump laid off hundreds of FAA [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=16.0s)]
*  employees this weekend, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=17.96s)]
*  less than three weeks after [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=19.64s)]
*  the deadly crash between an army, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Black Hawk helicopter and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=23.28s)]
*  commercial airliner. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=24.92s)]
*  This comes as Trump and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=26.36s)]
*  Elon Musk have been purging [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=27.68s)]
*  government agencies through [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=29.2s)]
*  mass layoffs. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=30.68s)]
*  Keep in mind, the FAA also [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=32.12s)]
*  regulates SpaceX and has been [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=34.28s)]
*  critical of them in the past. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=36.76s)]
*  The FAA last year proposed civil [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=39.16s)]
*  penalties against SpaceX over [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=41.72s)]
*  alleged licensing and safety [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=44.2s)]
*  violations after which Musk [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  threatened to sue the agency. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=48.64s)]
*  The FAA oversight on Musk's company [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=50.96s)]
*  has serious implications. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  In mid January, for example, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  a SpaceX rocket explosion affected [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=57.48s)]
*  dozens of flights, prompting [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  detours and sending debris into [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  the Caribbean. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=64.0s)]
*  NBC added the FAA ordered SpaceX to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=64.96s)]
*  conduct a mishap investigation [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=67.36s)]
*  following the incident. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=69.64s)]
*  Last Thursday, the Trump [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=71.92s)]
*  administration decided to broaden [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=73.32s)]
*  its efforts to upend the federal [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=75.28s)]
*  workforce by announcing layoffs of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=77.12s)]
*  probationary workers. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=79.16s)]
*  Officials have set their sights on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=81.36s)]
*  probationary workers who have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=82.92s)]
*  typically been employed for [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=84.44s)]
*  less than a year. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=85.8s)]
*  Because they have fewer job [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=87.08s)]
*  protections and lack the right to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  appeal. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=90.64s)]
*  More than 200,000 employees have [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=92.0s)]
*  worked within the federal [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=93.92s)]
*  government for less than a year, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=95.24s)]
*  according to the most recent 2024 [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=97.08s)]
*  data from the US Office of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=99.08s)]
*  Personnel Management. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=100.56s)]
*  And the Professional Aviation [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=103.2s)]
*  Safety Specialist Union confirmed [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=105.0s)]
*  over the weekend that those were [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=107.08s)]
*  the ones that were targeted. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=108.8s)]
*  A union spokesperson said close to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=110.56s)]
*  300 of its members received [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=112.64s)]
*  termination notices over [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=114.32s)]
*  the weekend. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=116.24s)]

*  and program assistance. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=130.0s)]
*  It's important to note here and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=131.76s)]
*  that the firings did not include [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=133.88s)]
*  air traffic controllers. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=136.12s)]

*  classified early radar and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=142.4s)]
*  really warning radar system. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=144.92s)]
*  The Air Force had announced in 2023 [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=147.96s)]
*  for Hawaii to detect incoming [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=150.24s)]
*  cruise missiles through a program [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=152.2s)]
*  that was in part funded by [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=154.44s)]
*  the Department of Defense. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=156.0s)]
*  It's one of several programs that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=157.72s)]
*  the FAA's National Defense Program [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=159.88s)]

*  providing longer rage detection [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=164.28s)]
*  around the country's borders. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=166.52s)]
*  Seems important. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=168.76s)]
*  And to no one's surprise, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=170.72s)]
*  the union is pissed. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=172.56s)]
*  And rightfully so. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=173.92s)]
*  The union representing the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=175.64s)]
*  employees called the firings a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=177.24s)]
*  hastily made decision that would [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=179.2s)]
*  increase the workload of a workforce [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=181.2s)]
*  already stretched thin. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=183.4s)]
*  The union statement referred to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=185.24s)]
*  the DC crash as well as to others [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=187.04s)]
*  in recent weeks across the country [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=188.88s)]
*  as evidence that it was not [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=190.96s)]
*  the time to cut back personnel at [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=192.64s)]
*  the agency. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=194.72s)]
*  This decision did not consider [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=196.16s)]
*  the staffing needs of the FAA, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=198.32s)]
*  which is already challenged by [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=200.48s)]
*  understaffing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=202.6s)]
*  Staffing decisions should be based [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=203.84s)]
*  on an individual agency's mission [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=206.24s)]
*  critical needs to do otherwise is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=208.72s)]
*  dangerous when it comes to public [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=211.08s)]
*  safety and it is especially [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  unconscionable in the aftermath of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=215.68s)]
*  three deadly aircraft accidents in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  the past month. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=221.32000000000002s)]
*  Cenk, does this make you nervous [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=222.72000000000003s)]
*  to fly? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  You're jet setting around the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=224.88000000000002s)]
*  country doing interviews. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=226.28s)]
*  Any sense of unease here? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=227.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's sitting in the middle [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=229.0s)]
*  in economy, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=230.84s)]
*  not exactly jet setting. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=231.56s)]
*  But okay, so I am, actually, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=233.0s)]
*  that's our poll question. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=235.76s)]
*  I was like, really, are we going to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=239.44s)]
*  be afraid to fly? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=240.88s)]
*  Flying is compared to driving is so [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=241.6s)]
*  much safer, but it did make me go. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=243.64s)]
*  I mean, we just had two crashes and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=247.32s)]

*  an air traffic controller who is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=255.12s)]
*  handling both the planes and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=256.88s)]
*  the helicopters. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=258.4s)]
*  It's supposed to be two different [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=259.4s)]
*  people, but they were understaffed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=260.8s)]
*  And then a helicopter and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=262.48s)]
*  a plane crashed, oops. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=263.6s)]

*  If you're a right winger and [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=517.84s)]
*  you don't believe me, you'll see [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  they're going to pass a corporate [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=521.28s)]
*  tax cut that will swallow all these [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  so-called cost savings and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=525.6s)]
*  go way past it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  And then when they go to justify, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  they'll say, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=531.88s)]
*  we already did the cost cutting. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=532.4399999999999s)]
*  So that's why we can take all of it [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=533.8399999999999s)]
*  and give it to corporations [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=535.3199999999999s)]
*  instead of you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=536.52s)]
*  Guaranteed, guaranteed, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=537.64s)]
*  quote me on it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=539.6s)]
*  Live chat emojis, badges. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=549.16s)]
*  You've got emojis of me, Anna, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=551.88s)]
*  John, JR. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQAH3svhks&t=553.9599999999999s)]
