The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# New Book Exposes Trump's Take on Elon Musk's Strange Campaign Trail Behavior
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E)
*  Where is he? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=0.0s)]
*  Come on up here, Ilan. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1.92s)]
*  He created the first major American [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=3.56s)]
*  car company in generations and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=6.28s)]
*  his rocket company is the only [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  reason we can now send American [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=10.78s)]
*  astronauts into space. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Come here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=14.96s)]
*  Take over, Ilan, yes, take over. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=16.16s)]
*  Is the only reason we can now send [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  American astronauts into space. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Take over, Ilan, yes, take over. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=23.28s)]
*  All right, well despite being best [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  buddies now, it seems that President [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  Trump was not always the biggest [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=32.72s)]
*  fan of Ilan Musk, especially not [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=34.5s)]
*  when he was jumping around on [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=36.36s)]
*  the stage like an idiot at his [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=38.08s)]
*  Butler rally back in October. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=39.8s)]
*  I know it was just a few months ago, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=42.04s)]
*  but it feels like forever ago, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=43.56s)]
*  doesn't it? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  But first, before we get into what [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=45.56s)]
*  Trump said about Ilan Musk, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=47.44s)]
*  allegedly, Cenk, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=48.96s)]
*  what do you think of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=50.0s)]
*  their relationship? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=51.0s)]
*  Do you think it's just for show? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=52.04s)]
*  Do you think they actually like [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=53.56s)]
*  each other? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=54.96s)]
*  Or do you think maybe it's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  mutually beneficial and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=56.96s)]
*  Trump is just going to drop Ilan [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=58.36s)]
*  once he is no longer useful? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=60.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, the only reason why [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=61.8s)]
*  Trump hasn't dropped Ilan Musk when [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=63.96s)]
*  he normally hates sharing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=66.44s)]
*  the spotlight, despises it to his [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=68.64s)]
*  core is because of Zamanie Lebowski. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=71.4s)]
*  So what form that takes is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=75.32s)]
*  an interesting question. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=76.68s)]
*  And whether this story is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=78.52s)]
*  believable is an interesting [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=79.64s)]
*  question because of the person [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=80.92s)]
*  telling it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=82.44s)]
*  But it's got a lot of interesting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=83.12s)]
*  nuggets in it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=84.36s)]
*  So let's talk about it and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=85.36s)]
*  see what we believe and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=86.28s)]
*  what we don't believe. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=87.16s)]
*  So what do you got there, yes? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=88.12s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=90.12s)]
*  that is a great point and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=91.0s)]
*  we will get into the credibility [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=92.12s)]
*  of all this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=93.72s)]
*  But in Michael Wolff's new book, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  All or Nothing, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=96.56s)]
*  How Trump Recaptured America, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=97.68s)]
*  Wolff delves into all of the juicy [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  drama that surrounds the main [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  characters of the Trump [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  administration like Ilan Musk and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=104.72s)]
*  Donald Trump and JD Vance. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=106.92s)]
*  So following Trump's return to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=109.04s)]
*  Butler, Pennsylvania after his [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=110.84s)]
*  first assassination attempt, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  Ilan Musk raised some eyebrows as [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=114.76s)]
*  he walked around on the stage. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=116.88s)]
*  You all remember it, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  we all saw it, it was weird. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=119.72s)]
*  And apparently Trump had the same [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=121.24s)]
*  reaction as the rest of us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=123.24s)]
*  Wolff wrote in his first book, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=124.96s)]
*  it was first reported by [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  the Daily Beast, what the F is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=128.44s)]
*  wrong with this guy and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=130.56s)]
*  why doesn't his shirt fit? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=132.24s)]
*  Because his belly was all over [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=134.64s)]
*  the place. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=136.72s)]
*  It was brutal, but apparently [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=138.16s)]
*  that's not all that happened that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=139.72s)]
*  day. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=141.44s)]
*  In addition to Trump having some [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=141.94s)]
*  choice words for Ilan Musk, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Ilan also had some choice words or [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=145.96s)]
*  really no words at all for [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=148.28s)]
*  JD Vance at the rally. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=150.2s)]
*  He said, I really no interest in [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=152.28s)]
*  speaking to a vice president, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=154.24s)]
*  Musk replied after being asked if [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  he would like to meet Vance while [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=158.2s)]
*  snacking on pretzels. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  So it makes me wonder why we [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  haven't seen a joint interview with [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=163.0s)]
*  Ilan and JD Vance, but yet we've [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=164.96s)]
*  gotten a joint interview with Ilan [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=166.96s)]
*  Musk and Trump, take a look. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=169.0s)]
*  The New York Times, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=171.24s)]
*  Washington Post, three networks, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=172.2s)]
*  every late night comedy show, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  two cable channels, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  they drew everything, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  lawfare, weaponization. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=178.92s)]
*  And now I see, they want you two [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  to start, they want a divorce, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  they want you two to start hating [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  each other. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=187.6s)]
*  They tried it, then they stopped, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=189.11999999999998s)]
*  that was it, they have many [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=191.12s)]
*  different things of hatred. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=192.56s)]
*  Actually, Ilan called me, he said, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=194.56s)]
*  they're trying to drive us apart. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=196.56s)]
*  I said, absolutely. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  Do you view Vice President JD Vance [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=199.92s)]
*  as your successor, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=202.0s)]
*  the Republican nominee in 2028? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=203.32s)]
*  No, but he's very capable. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=205.44s)]
*  Not mincing words there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=207.36s)]
*  So as Cenk mentioned earlier, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=211.52s)]
*  we do have to take all of this with [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=213.16s)]
*  a grain of salt because as we'll [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=214.96s)]
*  get into next, Michael Wolff might [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=216.76s)]

*  the world. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=220.44s)]
*  But even if these accounts are true, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=221.16s)]
*  there's really no way to prove it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=222.84s)]
*  And even if we could prove it, so [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=224.28s)]
*  what? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=226.08s)]
*  Trump supporters and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=226.64s)]
*  Ilan supporters aren't going to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=227.8s)]
*  drop their guise over something [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=229.44s)]
*  like this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=231.04s)]
*  Although I did find it funny that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=231.84s)]
*  Ilan allegedly said he didn't want [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=233.72s)]
*  to talk to a vice president, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  not the vice president, but [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=237.52s)]
*  just like any vice president, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=239.08s)]
*  because vice presidents are lame. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=240.84s)]
*  Mark, let's start with you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  Is this fun for you or [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  is it maybe a little bit tiresome? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's foretelling of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=247.0s)]
*  everything in even the clip from [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=249.24s)]
*  that rally when he says, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  take over Ilan, take over Ilan. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  Because he really has turned [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=255.72000000000003s)]
*  the keys of the governmental car [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=257.36s)]
*  over to Ilan Musk. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=259.2s)]
*  But the other thing is very much to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=261.08s)]
*  what Cenk says, and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=263.2s)]
*  I have a third thing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=264.4s)]
*  The other thing is about the money [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  and the fact that he has a lot of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=267.76s)]
*  leverage with government contracts. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=269.35999999999996s)]
*  So they'll really never probably be [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=271.44s)]
*  a breakup of the sort that Sean [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=273.4s)]
*  Hannity was hinting at in that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=275.0s)]
*  interview or the idea somehow that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  this guy would take a lot of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=278.64s)]
*  the spotlight would normally [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=280.24s)]
*  absolutely end their relationship, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  as Cenk says. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=284.9s)]
*  But he, and this is the third thing, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=286.36s)]
*  also performs an incredibly [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=289.16s)]
*  important role in their [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=291.2s)]
*  relationship, Ilan does. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  And that is that he takes a lot of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  the hate. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  This is going to be a hateful [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  period, already it's happening. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=299.48s)]
*  You see Americans turning on this [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=301.68s)]
*  plan where they just decapitate [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=303.64s)]
*  government and sort of haphazardly [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=305.64s)]
*  with a meat ax, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=307.88s)]
*  just get rid of stuff. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=308.92s)]
*  I mean, there's no evaluation of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=310.52s)]
*  fraud and abuse. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  They are just getting rid of people [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  and this bloodletting that they're [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  doing is really unpopular. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=318.88s)]
*  It's going to affect a lot of key [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=320.32s)]
*  governmental aspects of life that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=322.28s)]
*  Americans count on. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  So they hate who? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=325.64s)]
*  They hate Elon Musk. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=328.4s)]
*  And in a way, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=330.32s)]
*  he's blocking for Donald Trump. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=331.32s)]
*  Trump's approval ratings are still [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=333.67999999999995s)]
*  much higher than Ilan's right now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=335.64s)]
*  So I think when you add that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=337.52s)]
*  altogether, you've got Ilan doing [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=339.28s)]
*  the dirty work. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  You've got Ilan with all that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=342.67999999999995s)]
*  leverage as a contractor and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  beyond and all that money that he [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=345.76s)]
*  can pour into and threaten other [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=347.52s)]
*  political figures who might be [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=349.28s)]
*  adversarial to Trump. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=350.88s)]
*  And lastly, he can take the heat [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=352.12s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=353.32s)]
*  That's the way I see [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=353.88s)]
*  the relationship. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=354.68s)]
*  Yeah, so why is he still hanging [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  around? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=357.64s)]
*  Because put aside this, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=358.2s)]
*  look, Michael Wolfe is a guy who [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=359.8s)]
*  was very respected back in the day. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  But then during the first Trump [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=364.48s)]
*  term, he put a couple things in his [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=366.44s)]
*  books that didn't seem like they [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=368.48s)]
*  were real or at least not verified [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=370.52s)]
*  enough. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=372.96s)]
*  And it's sent, see, because look, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=373.76s)]
*  if you're in the right wing and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=376.68s)]
*  Ilan says that we've saved, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  actually Trump said billions. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=381.26s)]
*  Ilan said a lot of money that was [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=383.28s)]
*  going from USAID to big media, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=386.44s)]
*  right, traditional media. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=389.48s)]
*  I'm just picking one of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  the random lies, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=393.24s)]
*  And so then they look into it, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=394.92s)]
*  USAID turns out had spent $24,000 [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=397.12s)]
*  on new subscriptions for [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=399.92s)]
*  their employees. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=402.56s)]
*  If you want to read the New York [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=403.64s)]
*  Times as part of your job, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=404.92s)]
*  you need to know that and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=406.08s)]
*  you had to get beyond the paywall. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=407.2s)]
*  Okay, USAID will pay for [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=409.24s)]
*  that new subscription, 24,000. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=411.32s)]
*  Trump said billions, right? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=414.92s)]
*  So these huge, huge lies, etc. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=417.52s)]
*  So look, and I like Mark's theory [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=421.92s)]
*  and I've hinted at that as well [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=425.92s)]
*  before where as when we did [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=429.16s)]
*  the story of Elon Musk polling [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=431.36s)]
*  numbers going down, but [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=433.72s)]
*  Trump's was still high. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=435.38000000000005s)]
*  So he's taken a lot of the blows [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=436.76000000000005s)]
*  for Donald Trump. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=438.68s)]
*  It seemed like Mark was going [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=439.88000000000005s)]
*  towards saying that he's kind of [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  an offensive line for Donald Trump [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  in more ways than one, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=445.24s)]
*  And so that's true, but [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  is that why Trump is still staying [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=449.48s)]
*  with him? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=452.48s)]
*  No, that's too sophisticated for [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=456.28000000000003s)]
*  So he hates sharing the spotlight, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=457.68s)]
*  he's always hated it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=460.36s)]
*  So my point is that with whether [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=462.6s)]
*  Michael Wolfe is right or [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=465.04s)]
*  not about this particular story, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=467.04s)]
*  we know Donald Trump. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=469.64s)]
*  And we know that anytime that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=472.2s)]
*  anyone's shared the spotlight with [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=473.52s)]
*  him, he's immediately cut him off [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=475.12s)]
*  at the knees and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=476.6s)]
*  forget getting rid of him. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  You all, even if you're on [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=478.76s)]
*  the right, you'll know this is true. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=480.0s)]
*  He'll always cut him down. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=481.88s)]
*  He'll always humiliate them and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  embarrass them. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=485.56s)]
*  Like he did with Chris Christie and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=486.68s)]
*  how he's so fat, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=488.76s)]
*  even with RFK Jr. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=489.8s)]
*  Making him eat the McDonald's and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=490.88s)]
*  it just in every way he's always, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=493.32s)]
*  that's such a tiny story. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=495.56s)]
*  But you have seen it a thousand [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=497.44s)]
*  times, Tim Scott, Nikki Haley, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=499.36s)]
*  appointed you the senator from [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=501.52s)]
*  South Carolina. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=503.32s)]
*  So you come on here and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  tell everybody how awful Nikki [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=505.64s)]
*  Haley is and then he's just doing [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=507.32s)]
*  it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=509.36s)]
*  He made fun of how Tim Scott might [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=511.12s)]
*  be gay. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=512.64s)]
*  He's just, but he's never humiliated [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=513.2s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=515.64s)]
*  Why? There's such a simple answer. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  Zamanie Lebowski. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=518.84s)]
*  So look, let me give you a couple [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=520.64s)]
*  of quick ones. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=521.72s)]
*  First of all, $277 million in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  campaign contributions to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=524.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, his largest donor. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=525.52s)]
*  And you guys, George Soros, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=527.88s)]
*  George Soros, it's true. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  George Soros is a huge donor on [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=530.12s)]
*  the Democratic side. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=531.4s)]
*  We are concerned about George [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=532.56s)]
*  Soros, not as a person, not as [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=533.8s)]
*  whatever the hell he wants to do [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=535.36s)]
*  in his private life. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=537.0s)]
*  And I like the charities that he [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=538.36s)]
*  gives money to, etc. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=540.0s)]
*  But I'm concerned about anybody, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=541.64s)]
*  anybody at all being able to buy [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=543.24s)]
*  politicians. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=544.76s)]
*  The right wing used to be [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=545.76s)]
*  concerned about that. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=547.0s)]
*  Now, 277 million, that is an [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=548.04s)]
*  unbelievable amount of money. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=549.96s)]
*  If Soros had spent that money [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=552.16s)]
*  buying Biden or Trump, you all [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=553.64s)]
*  would jump out of your skin. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=555.28s)]
*  So does Donald Trump care about [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=556.84s)]
*  that? Of course, but [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=558.08s)]
*  theoretically, hopefully he does [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=559.04s)]
*  it on again. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=560.56s)]
*  So why does he care beyond that? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  Because then Elon, right after [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=563.24s)]
*  the election said, Twitter did [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=564.92s)]
*  something bad to you before I took [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=566.68s)]
*  over. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=568.64s)]
*  Here's $10 million check, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=569.92s)]
*  not into the taxpayers, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=571.6s)]
*  into Donald Trump's pocket. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=573.5200000000001s)]
*  He just gave him $10 million, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=575.5200000000001s)]
*  just gave it to him, right? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=577.72s)]
*  So now then Trump used to be [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=580.1600000000001s)]
*  against crypto. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=581.9200000000001s)]
*  Musk and the other guys come and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=583.6s)]
*  whisper in his ear, crypto, yeah, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=585.08s)]
*  crypto is, hey, look, you're a con, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=586.88s)]
*  man. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=588.76s)]
*  Half a crypto is nothing but a con. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  These things called meme coins, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  they're worthless, but [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=593.12s)]
*  you put them up and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=594.5200000000001s)]
*  then people put their money in, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=595.44s)]
*  especially because they trust you. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  And you're a legendary con man, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  they'll put it, and they did, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  $15 billion into his meme coin. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=601.12s)]
*  And then you pull the rug, and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=602.68s)]
*  that's down to $3 billion, and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=604.16s)]
*  then the $12 billion, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=605.7199999999999s)]
*  we pocket all together. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=606.8s)]
*  And again, not to the taxpayers, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=608.2399999999999s)]
*  not to the Republican party, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=609.68s)]
*  not to your campaign, we put [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=611.04s)]
*  the money in our freaking pockets. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=612.3599999999999s)]
*  That's why he hasn't cut Elon Musk [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  down to size. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=616.56s)]
*  That's why he hasn't gotten rid of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=617.8399999999999s)]
*  him because Elon's dangling that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=619.28s)]
*  money in front of him. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  It's like 10 million here, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=621.7199999999999s)]
*  a little bit more there, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=622.92s)]
*  a little bit more there. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=623.88s)]
*  Come here, come here, come here, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=625.0s)]
*  but doggy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=626.2399999999999s)]
*  And so that's what's happening [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=626.8399999999999s)]
*  here, but that's part of why [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=627.92s)]
*  Bannon is disgusted by this [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=629.1199999999999s)]
*  situation. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=630.52s)]
*  It's because it's so [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  brazen and obvious. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=633.04s)]
*  So, and last thing, and then he [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=634.68s)]
*  adds back to you is that Elon's [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=636.76s)]
*  a runaway freight train. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=639.24s)]
*  Again, he says this about Vance, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=641.7199999999999s)]
*  Trump says it about Elon or [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=643.76s)]
*  not behind the scenes, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  doesn't matter, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  I got eyes and ears, man. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=647.8399999999999s)]
*  So look, I don't know if he's on [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=649.8s)]
*  things, people keep saying he's on [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=651.52s)]
*  things, a lot of people on the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=653.52s)]
*  right say he's on things. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=655.12s)]
*  I don't know the drug world, and [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=656.64s)]
*  I don't know and I don't care, okay? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=658.24s)]
*  But he acts so freaking weird, and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=660.36s)]
*  I don't mean weird like, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=663.9200000000001s)]
*  he makes me uncomfortable. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=666.08s)]
*  No, he just does things that are [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=669.12s)]
*  nonsensical. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=670.88s)]
*  I don't care if he's on something [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=672.4000000000001s)]
*  or not on something, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=674.36s)]
*  he's a runaway freight train. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  And so this is not going to end [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=678.32s)]
*  well, and not just for the country, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=680.32s)]
*  but for the right wing. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=682.6800000000001s)]
*  You touch people's social, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=684.7600000000001s)]
*  you screw up anything along those [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=685.96s)]
*  lines, you're going to lose [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=687.6s)]
*  the entire country. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=689.12s)]
*  So again, if I was a right winger, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  I'd be furious at these clowns. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=692.44s)]
*  because it's all about them, them, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=694.4000000000001s)]
*  them, them, and they're never [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=695.76s)]
*  going to give you any of the things [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=696.76s)]
*  that you actually want. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=697.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm honestly surprised that [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  this relationship has lasted as [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=701.6s)]
*  long as it has because they're both [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=703.44s)]
*  such egomaniacs, they both need all [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=705.24s)]
*  the money and all the power and all [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=707.2s)]
*  the authority, all the attention. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=709.0s)]
*  Right now, they seem to have some [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=711.5200000000001s)]
*  common interests and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=713.24s)]
*  some common goals, but it's really [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=714.2s)]
*  only a matter of time before this [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=716.0400000000001s)]
*  implodes on both of them. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=717.84s)]
*  Elon Musk has all the money in [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=720.1600000000001s)]
*  the world, he has the most money [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  out of everyone in the world. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=723.12s)]
*  And Donald Trump has a lot of money [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=724.76s)]
*  on his own, but he doesn't have as [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=726.6s)]

*  But Trump is more familiar with [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=729.32s)]
*  the political aspect of things and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=730.96s)]
*  he is still the president, right? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=732.88s)]
*  As much as we like to joke about [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=735.48s)]
*  President Elon Musk, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=737.0s)]
*  Trump is still the president. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=738.1600000000001s)]
*  He's still the one who has all [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=739.5600000000001s)]
*  the protections. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=741.0400000000001s)]
*  He's still the one who gets to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=741.9200000000001s)]
*  wield his power and influence with [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  other world leaders around and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=746.12s)]

*  So we'll see, it's going to be [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=751.24s)]
*  an interesting power play between [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=752.76s)]

*  the claim. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=864.48s)]
*  Wolfe declined to comment to CNN, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=865.16s)]
*  but told the New York Times his [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=867.36s)]
*  source was impeccable and that he [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=869.28s)]
*  had no doubt about the authenticity [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=871.28s)]

*  his reporting. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=875.52s)]
*  Additionally, in his other book, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=876.56s)]
*  Fire and Fury, parts of it were [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=878.9599999999999s)]
*  disputed by some of the subjects [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=880.92s)]
*  involved in fact checking [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=882.88s)]
*  organizations like PolitiFact said [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=884.56s)]
*  the book contained factual errors. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=886.88s)]
*  For instance, PolitiFact noted [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=889.0799999999999s)]
*  Wolfe suggested in the book that [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=890.92s)]
*  Trump didn't know who former [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=892.92s)]
*  House Speaker John Boehner was in [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=894.84s)]
*  2016, when in fact Trump had [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=897.08s)]
*  previously tweeted about his [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=898.92s)]
*  tendency to cry. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=900.92s)]
*  Nevertheless, Wolfe said at [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=902.08s)]
*  the time that he stood by [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=904.16s)]
*  absolutely everything in the book. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=905.84s)]
*  So, yeah, so we did mention that [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=908.4s)]
*  at the beginning of the story right [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=910.6s)]
*  at the very top because we knew as [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=912.96s)]
*  soon as you mentioned Michael [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=915.16s)]
*  Wolfe these days, that's the first [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=917.2s)]
*  that's going to come up is back in [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=919.52s)]
*  2019 he tried to release this book [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=921.56s)]
*  and it didn't go well for him. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=923.64s)]
*  The book came out with a bang and [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=925.6s)]
*  then it kind of fizzled out pretty [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=927.24s)]
*  quickly. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=929.12s)]
*  So, do I think this is going to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=929.72s)]
*  have any kind of real implications [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=931.28s)]
*  as to what's going on in [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=933.04s)]
*  the country right now? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=934.28s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=935.56s)]
*  I think everybody's going to [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  continue just watching the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=937.92s)]
*  relationship between these two men, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=939.24s)]
*  one who was elected and [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=941.12s)]
*  one who was not and see how that's [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=942.28s)]
*  going to play out. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=944.04s)]
*  And more importantly though, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=945.0799999999999s)]
*  I think people are just concerned [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=946.6s)]
*  that all the things that Elon Musk [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=948.4s)]
*  is doing with his Doge and [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=950.24s)]
*  the things that Trump is doing is [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=951.52s)]
*  going to affect their lives [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=953.24s)]
*  personally. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=954.6s)]
*  Already we're seeing people whose [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=955.4s)]
*  lives have gotten worse for in one [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=957.4s)]
*  way or another because of the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=959.2s)]
*  things that Elon Musk is doing with [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=960.76s)]
*  Doge and his handful of children [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=962.8000000000001s)]
*  who is running that department. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=964.6s)]
*  So, Mark, what do you think is [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=966.44s)]
*  going to come from this if anything? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=968.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think your take on it is [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=970.08s)]
*  pretty healthy. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=971.6800000000001s)]
*  I doubt that there's going to be [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=972.64s)]
*  anything really seismic that's [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=974.28s)]
*  going to result from this [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=976.0s)]
*  of text. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=977.5600000000001s)]
*  I will say this and I think you did [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=978.08s)]
*  a nice job on detailing some of [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=979.84s)]
*  the issues around Wolf's reporting. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=981.44s)]
*  But everything that Wolf says in [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=983.88s)]
*  this instance seems pretty [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=985.5600000000001s)]
*  consistent with Donald Trump. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=986.84s)]
*  It's not like you read any of [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=988.72s)]
*  Michael Wolf stuff and you go, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=990.12s)]

*  he would never do that. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=992.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, so everything sort of is in [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=994.08s)]
*  tune and out of that same hymnal. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=996.36s)]
*  I don't think it'll have a great [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=999.1600000000001s)]
*  effect in terms of what will [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1000.96s)]
*  actually affect for example, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1002.44s)]
*  approval ratings or even policy. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1004.2800000000001s)]
*  I think in the end, these are sort [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1006.68s)]
*  of saucy anecdotes, but they do [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1008.76s)]
*  give us a chance to re-examine [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1010.72s)]
*  the relationship between Trump and [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1012.52s)]
*  Musk and some of what we've done [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1014.52s)]
*  here today. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1016.3199999999999s)]
*  When you talk about the, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1017.0799999999999s)]
*  there's a financial relationship [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1018.76s)]
*  there that is so very critical. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1021.04s)]
*  And Cenk is so right when he talks [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1022.96s)]
*  about the fact that they've [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1024.8s)]
*  invented really the Musk tech bro [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1026.52s)]
*  world of the White House has [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1028.72s)]
*  invented for Trump an entire area [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1030.68s)]
*  of dark money in which he can [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1033.08s)]

*  know about that have it on his [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1037.54s)]
*  radar prior to becoming president. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1039.36s)]
*  So Musk continues to find ways to [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1041.7s)]
*  become very valuable to Donald [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1043.66s)]
*  Trump. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1045.44s)]
*  Yeah, and my last fun point is [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1046.94s)]
*  about Steven Chung. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1048.78s)]
*  He was a communications director [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1050.1s)]
*  for Trump during the campaign. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1051.78s)]
*  And he's the one that does all [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1053.42s)]
*  those fiery statements like his [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1055.1s)]
*  peanut sized brain, etc. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1056.78s)]
*  And but now he's the White House [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1058.22s)]
*  communications director. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1060.62s)]
*  Communications director, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1062.82s)]
*  a bit of an odd job for [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1064.5s)]
*  Steven Chung, you would think but [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1065.92s)]
*  I'm starting to like it. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1068.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1070.3799999999999s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1070.8999999999999s)]
*  He's a wordsmith. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1072.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1074.06s)]
*  No, I like that attitude. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1074.66s)]
*  I like that attitude. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1076.1399999999999s)]
*  If you did it in service of [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1077.42s)]
*  the American people, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1078.82s)]
*  that could be fun. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDKvdTw0H9E&t=1080.1s)]
