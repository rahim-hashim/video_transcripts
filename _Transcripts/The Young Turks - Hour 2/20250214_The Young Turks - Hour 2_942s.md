The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Everyone NEEDS To Hear This Discussion About Media
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8)
*  I think are different animals than any of this. I don't think they're part of any machine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=0.0s)]
*  Don't you think they're the, but they are still in the right wing ecosystem, wouldn't [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  you agree? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=13.16s)]
*  No. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=14.16s)]
*  No. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=15.16s)]
*  We're all in agreement then. On the most recent episode of Jon Stewart's podcast, The Weekly [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=16.16s)]
*  Show, he and MSNBC host Jen Psaki had an interesting back and forth, some of which you just saw [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=21.28s)]
*  They were debating whether or not podcasters like Joe Rogan and Theo Vaughn are part of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=27.28s)]
*  the quote Trump enterprise as Psaki called it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=32.32s)]
*  We're going to show you more of that conversation, but then we're gonna have a discussion of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  our own. First, let's start with Stewart's critiques of mainstream liberal media outlets [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=38.96s)]
*  like MSNBC. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  On the Republican side, the synchronicity between the think tanks and the politicians [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=45.68s)]
*  and the billionaire donors, right? And the media arm, they work together. It is the circle [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=56.88s)]
*  of life. It is the lion king. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=65.08s)]
*  And MSNBC, I am unburdened by not having, I can share whatever I think. I have obviously [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=66.92s)]
*  worked in democratic politics for 20 years. I don't hide anything about that. It is not [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  a mouthpiece of the Democratic Party. I don't want it to be a mouthpiece of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=75.36s)]
*  Democratic Party, but I do think it can stand for something more coherent and be more effective [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=79.28s)]
*  in its execution of that by doing so. And what do you think that should be? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=86.76s)]
*  That it should be muckraking in the best sense of the word, but effective muckraking needs [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=91.72s)]
*  and a leader. Look, they're kicking progressive ass right now. And if progressives don't organize [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=98.68s)]
*  their media, their think tanks and all that, it's going to continue to happen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=109.56s)]
*  Now, Saki responded by getting into the familiar argument that right-wing media is more cohesive [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=114.84s)]
*  than left-wing media. But Stewart took issue with the examples that she used. Take a look. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  Broadly speaking, what Democrats, I don't think it's the Democrats. I'm gonna say people on the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=126.24s)]
*  left do not do that the right does very well, is support within the system, each other. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=130.23999999999998s)]
*  And what I mean by this is this, right? Yeah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=140.16s)]
*  Theo Vaughn appears on Joe Rogan's show, right? He promotes what Joe Rogan's doing. But they all [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=142.72s)]
*  promote all of the things each other are doing and what the elected officials, I guess, are doing too. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=148.88s)]
*  And the left is a little bit more kind of discombobulated in terms of supporting the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=154.12s)]
*  different entities on the left. There is not a left ecosystem that matches the right ecosystem. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=160.12s)]
*  But Ailes didn't do that either. It was the principle, the ideological principles, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=165.96s)]
*  not the party. He and Murdoch the same way. They're promoting an ideological worldview, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=172.12s)]
*  right? That they believe is correct. And Theo Vaughn and Joe Rogan, I think, are different animals [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=180.08s)]
*  than any of this. I don't think they're part of any machine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=186.0s)]
*  Don't you think they're the ant? But they are still in the right-wing ecosystem, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=190.72s)]
*  wouldn't you agree? No. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=196.24s)]
*  And they kept going for a while. Let's watch some more of their argument. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=197.52s)]
*  No? No. I would consider them in a [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=202.08s)]
*  more probably libertarian comedic complex. More along the lines of, and if you watch or listen to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=206.0s)]
*  their shows, A, a lot of times it's just pure goofing off. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=217.32s)]
*  Has nothing to do with politics and oftentimes. Almost entirely. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=221.0s)]
*  But they are supportive of the Trump enterprise is what I mean. So maybe I'm loosely putting them [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=225.0s)]
*  in that category. I think they are supportive, but not, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  they are not relentless in the Trump enterprise. They are not Charlie Kirk. They are not [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=236.11999999999998s)]
*  Ben Shapiro. They are very different animals. They are not invested in that now that you get [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  picked up and go to the headlines of media. Yeah, but on balance, that's not what their shows are [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=248.92s)]
*  about. Well, there's a lot to break down here, Brett. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=254.27999999999997s)]
*  You were shaking your head vigorously. What was that about? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=258.36s)]
*  So most of the, so Jen Psaki already believes that she's always already right about stuff. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=262.04s)]
*  No. And you see her just go like, no, I am part of MSNBC. I get to do whatever I want and say [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  whatever I want. Yes, because you were the press secretary. You were already chosen because you [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=275.0s)]
*  believe what the party wants you to say. And you say what, you are in a single circle Venn diagram [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=280.6s)]
*  of that stuff. The rest of the country is outside it. And what they don't, what none of them [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=288.28s)]
*  understand is how a comedian's mind works. A comedian will tell the joke, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=293.32s)]
*  Joe Rogan has on Samaril, Bill Burr, Gaffigan. He'll have those people on. What John Stewart's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=299.79999999999995s)]
*  wrong about is that if you listen to Rogan, he will randomly bring up vaccines out of nowhere. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=307.64s)]
*  You'll be trying to talk about literally anything else. He's like bang, this is a vaccine thing. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  It's like, all right, stop, stop, stop. But Joe Rogan is more of an indicator than an influencer. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=316.36s)]
*  Maybe lately he's kind of been pulled into it, but Thiel von's not that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  Thiel von is definitely not that. Thiel von has very recently said very pro-trans stuff. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=324.2s)]
*  Like I played it on, we played it on some show I was on. But Thiel von is exactly what John Stewart's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=330.12s)]
*  saying. He's like a nonsense talker and he'll just do it. And you need to look to comedians now more [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  than ever. Real comedians, good comedians, not hack comedians. The good comedians who you could [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=343.72s)]
*  drop in any time period, any place, and they would come up with bits that work. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=347.72s)]
*  Right now there's just a similar happenstance success arc for the D-baggy, I'm gonna say [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=351.8s)]
*  something mean instead of something funny. And because the entire right wing audience is just [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=359.48s)]
*  frat boys quoting like Top Gun. And they quote things and they think that's them telling jokes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  That just is happening right now, but that's not comedy. And John Stewart knows that. That's why [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=371.88s)]
*  do you see John Stewart talk about Dave Chappelle and any comedian who loves comedy will just [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=376.28s)]
*  gravitate toward the funny joke right now. Joe Rogan is also a kind of a dumb dumb. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=384.52s)]
*  And that's why I call him an indicator. He just tells you what right wing arguments work. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=390.68s)]
*  He's not actively seeking them out. They just vibe with him and he repeats them. All the shows have [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=395.32s)]
*  it. Like Patrick Bedevitt has this guy Vinny on it who's an indicator. So Patrick Bedevitt's a smart [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=400.04s)]
*  one. Vinny is the dumb dumb. And if Vinny says something back, Patrick knows my audience knows [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  that my audience would say that too. So I'm gonna lean into that if it's convenient for me right [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=411.8s)]
*  now, cuz I'm the smart one and these are the indicators. I'm the influencer, they're the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=416.36s)]
*  indicators. This is a very important thing about media right now that everybody needs to know. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=421.08000000000004s)]
*  The difference between an influencer and an indicator. There's a lot more and I don't want [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=426.44s)]
*  to bulldoze the rest of it, but that's okay. I'm gonna agree with everything Brett said except [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=429.56s)]
*  Vinny. I kinda like Vinny. I like Vinny too. I did a video about Bill Burr right now on [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=434.12s)]
*  Rebel is Cure, but you should watch it. I say despite this guy, I can't believe he's able to, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=439.0s)]
*  his brain can tell his lungs to breathe. He's that dumb. I still like the guy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=445.16s)]
*  I still like tons of morons. I'm not better than them. They're so stupid, but I'm not better than [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=450.28s)]
*  them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=456.44s)]
*  I'm not convinced. Okay, so anyways, so look, let me double down on the things I agree on. So number [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=456.64s)]
*  one, no MSNBC let me say whatever I want. You were literally the mouthpiece for Joe Biden. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=463.24s)]
*  They hired you because you were the mouthpiece for Joe Biden, not despite the fact that you [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=470.44s)]
*  were the mouthpiece. So you are the epicenter of MSNBC group fit. And it's amazing she doesn't know [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=475.32s)]
*  that. She's like, MSNBC, they won't just say whatever Democrats want. Literally not true. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=482.28s)]
*  They will say whatever Democrats. Okay, Jen Psaki, I challenge you. Find three things for me that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=487.79999999999995s)]
*  MSNBC hosts said that were counter to Democratic leadership and I'll give you a decade. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=496.52s)]
*  Okay, by the way, you'll find them all from Chris Hayes. So look there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  Okay, he did it about three times in the last 10 years and no other host did. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=506.84s)]
*  So it's all about Joe Biden is young and dynamic. Joe Biden's the greatest thing ever. Joe Biden, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=511.08s)]
*  Joe Biden, Joe Biden, a couple of hairs is the greatest thing ever and a perfect campaign. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=515.72s)]
*  I mean, what kind of moron says she ran a flawless campaign after she lost every swing state and the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=518.92s)]
*  popular vote, right? The people who work at MSNBC who do propaganda. And that's why Jen [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=525.4s)]
*  Psaki is frustrated. She's like, the right wing supports each other. We don't support each other. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=529.88s)]
*  Wait, there's two things about that. Number one, that support goes in two different directions. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=533.8s)]
*  When's the last time the Democratic Party supported anyone that wasn't in mainstream media? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=538.76s)]
*  They don't even like mainstream media. They're like mainstream media. Joe Biden [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=544.04s)]
*  had and Kamala Harris's team. The reason they didn't do as many interviews is because they [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=546.84s)]
*  had a grudge with even mainstream media. They're like, they only did 98% propaganda for us. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=550.36s)]
*  We expect 200% propaganda, right? Well, then you're never going to be happy. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=555.88s)]
*  Because the minute anyone disagrees with you and says, hey, you know what? It would have been nice [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=560.68s)]
*  to do paid family leave, wouldn't it? Traitor, you're with the Republicans. You're a Trump lover. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=564.76s)]
*  You're going to vote for, you're going to drive everybody to Trump, aren't you? We hate you. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=570.28s)]
*  They say that to not just young Turks, guys. They say to all the shows we're in fights with, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=573.24s)]
*  they should say to far left, they say to middle left, they say to soft left, they say to everyone, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=578.84s)]
*  everyone who disagrees with the one single thing. They're like, you're banished. You're never allowed [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=585.24s)]
*  here. Shut up, etc. They're like, you're so oppressive. She was the thuggish arm of that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=589.96s)]
*  oppression. And now she's like, can you believe the media didn't support us? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=597.4000000000001s)]
*  I can't believe our left wing media does. You hate your base. You despise them. So then you're, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=602.2s)]
*  why didn't they support you? You need to support us more. It's weeks of entitlement. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=609.24s)]
*  So and one more thing, on the right wing, left wing thing, right? Get it out of your head. I get [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=614.52s)]
*  it. It's part of the political spectrum. But the Rogan and Theobald and those guys, they're not [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=620.84s)]
*  right or left wing. Even Portnoy is not left or right wing. They're the bro wing. It's totally [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=625.24s)]
*  different. So almost all of them are pro-choice. Almost all of them are anti-war. And they're not [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=632.2s)]
*  BSing because they're not right wingers. There's something different. Me no understand. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=638.12s)]
*  Everything is right or left wing. If Rogan says one nice thing about Trump, he's a Nazi and we [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=643.72s)]
*  hate him forever. But he endorsed Bernie Sanders before. But to Jen Psaki, Bernie Sanders, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=649.48s)]
*  Donald Trump was the difference. You didn't follow orders. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=655.96s)]
*  Yeah, what you're watching is Democrats try to make sense of this moment that we're in with [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=658.84s)]
*  YouTube and influencers having such a big and outsized role in this past election. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=664.84s)]
*  And I've worked in this space for nearly a decade now and with colleagues across the progressive and [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=669.72s)]
*  liberal spectrum have talked about the need for a cohesive ecosystem. And it's funny to see her [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  talk about that when just to give you a picture of how they interacted with organizations that [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=680.6s)]
*  were even mostly supportive. A anti-war liberal group went to meet with Joe Biden while he was [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=685.88s)]
*  still in the race to endorse him. And a representative from Biden came to the meeting to accept the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=693.1600000000001s)]
*  endorsement but also had printed out every single tweet that the executive director of that [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=698.2s)]
*  organization had made that was critical of Biden. So even when they're celebrating and meeting to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=702.9200000000001s)]
*  talk about an endorsement, they will still remind you, you have to be completely and totally loyal [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=708.44s)]
*  and submissive. You're not going to build an ecosystem when that is your attitude toward people [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=714.0400000000001s)]
*  who are even moderately critical. So there's two things. One is Jen Psaki wants this to be the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=718.84s)]
*  answer. She wants what she's saying to be right. It's not. It would be so much simpler for her if [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=724.28s)]
*  she could say that Joe Biden or that Joe Rogan is right wing. That would be easy. It's not the case. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=729.64s)]
*  But also you have to come to the table understanding what is actually important [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  and what are actual important disagreements versus what are things we can disagree on and [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=742.1999999999999s)]
*  walk around walk away from. And I mean, everybody should go rewatch Anna's interview with Sean [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=746.68s)]
*  O'Brien, where he talks about something very similar happening. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=752.52s)]
*  It's not just the one thing that the Jordan's talking about. It happens over and over again. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=755.24s)]
*  And the slight difference, the second thing is, everyone on the right still has the same instinct [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=759.48s)]
*  they're accusing the left of having an acting on. Just the people on the right don't act on that [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=766.76s)]
*  disagreement because they all know what power they don't have. And they know they'll have more [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=770.52s)]
*  power in the devil's bargain of right wingism if they just go along with Trump right now. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=776.92s)]
*  And it's never been more obvious that that's the case. They push around when they can, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=782.5999999999999s)]
*  but they seldom get out over their skis and overextending a power that ends up ruining [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=787.4s)]
*  the plane flies apart. That's the difference, I think. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=792.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, super last thing here, guys, couple of things. Number one, we had a poll in the live chat [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=796.1999999999999s)]
*  we're live at six o'clock Eastern, every day, Monday through Friday. And are Joe Rogan and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=801.48s)]
*  Theo von part of the Trump enterprise? I'm curious to see how you guys voted on that. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=806.6800000000001s)]
*  Look at that, 63% still say yes. That's amazing. Look, I love that we do a show where the audience [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=810.6800000000001s)]
*  can disagree with us and sometimes does, even though we're this passionate about it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=816.36s)]
*  Okay, you're frustrated about it. It's okay. It's okay. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=821.4s)]
*  Well, I just think it's a misunderstanding because you can be unwillingly or unwittingly a part of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=824.12s)]
*  the Trump enterprise. They're all getting used in ways that they don't. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=829.4s)]
*  That's okay for the 63% that voted. We love you guys, but we disagree. Because then if you froze [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=833.48s)]
*  it in time of Rogan in 2016, you could have argued that he was part of the Bernie enterprise. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=840.12s)]
*  And of course he wasn't part of the Bernie Center's enterprise because he's not part of [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=847.56s)]
*  any enterprise. Look, back when Rogan and I used to talk, he told me, look, I'm super lucky. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=850.1999999999999s)]
*  I have FU money. And you know what that allows me to do? It allows me to tell everybody to FU. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=856.44s)]
*  Okay, and so he's like, and I believe him. So he has his actual opinions. And I've gotten super mad [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=861.48s)]
*  about those opinions. Some of those opinions, right? That's normal, but then this is this [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=868.84s)]
*  old way of thinking. He endorsed Trump and Brett's 100% right. Because Jen Psaki doesn't wanna think [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=873.8800000000001s)]
*  we lost the medal. We lost the election. We lost America. No, everyone that voted for Trump [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=879.96s)]
*  is the worst person in the world and part of the Trump enterprise. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=886.28s)]
*  And so by the way, that interview with Sean O'Brien that Anna did is on Young Turk's main [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=890.04s)]
*  channel on YouTube. And lastly, John Stewart, 2028. And I could prove to you guys that Rogan [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=894.92s)]
*  and those guys are not right wing. Because if it was John Stewart versus an establishment Republican [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=901.24s)]
*  like Tom Cotton or Ted Cruz, I guarantee you that Rogan, Theobald and all of them would support [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=905.8s)]
*  John Stewart and not the establishment Republican. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7riFKRlIW8&t=913.16s)]
