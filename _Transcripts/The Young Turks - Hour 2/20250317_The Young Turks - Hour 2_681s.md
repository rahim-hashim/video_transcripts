# BRUTAL New Polls Spell DISASTER For Democratic Party
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo)
*  A brand new exclusive CNN poll that paints a brutal reality for Democrats as they struggle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=0.0s)]
*  to mount a unified opposition to President Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=6.96s)]
*  Americans favorable views of the Democratic Party brand are at a record low, just 29%. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=10.52s)]
*  That's compared to 36% for Republicans. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=17.12s)]
*  It is the lowest ever recorded for Democrats in CNN polling going back more than 30 years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=19.64s)]
*  Two damning new polls spelled disaster for the Democratic Party. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=26.36s)]
*  In CNN and NBC polling, record low shares of voters view the Democratic Party in a positive [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=30.46s)]
*  light. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=37.0s)]
*  And these polls were conducted before Chuck Schumer caved to the Republicans and voted [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=38.0s)]
*  in favor of their spending bill. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=42.96s)]
*  In the NBC poll, a record low share of voters view the Democratic Party positively. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=44.8s)]
*  Just over a quarter of registered voters, 27%, say they have positive views of the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=51.94s)]
*  party, which is the party's lowest positive rating in NBC News polling dating back to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=57.78s)]
*  1990. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=64.22s)]
*  Just 7% say those views are very positive. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=66.17999999999999s)]
*  A majority of voters, 55%, say they have negative views of the party, including 38%, who say [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=70.97999999999999s)]
*  those views are very negative. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=78.62s)]
*  And based on the polls other findings, it's clear that the reason Democrats popularity [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=81.72s)]
*  has dropped so low is because of their perceived weakness. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=86.18s)]
*  CNN and NBC found the Democratic voters want the party to hold the line on their positions. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=90.94s)]
*  In another, do you want Democrats in Congress to make compromises with President Trump to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=99.14s)]
*  gain consensus on legislation or stick to their positions, even if this means not getting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  things done in Washington? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=111.18s)]
*  In April 2017, 59% of Democrats said they wanted Congressional Democrats to make compromises [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=113.5s)]
*  with Trump to gain consensus. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=119.42s)]
*  But now the polling has completely flipped. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=121.62s)]
*  Almost two thirds of Democrats, 65%, say they want Congressional Democrats to stick to their [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=125.18s)]
*  positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=130.94s)]
*  Almost 32% want them to make legislative compromises with Trump. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=135.94s)]
*  The CNN poll showed similar results with 57% of Democratic voters saying Dems in Congress [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=141.42s)]
*  should stop the GOP agenda. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=147.7s)]
*  A growing source of frustration among many voters is Democrats' consistent assumption [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=151.46s)]
*  that one day Republicans will stand up to Trump if he breaks the law. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=157.22s)]
*  On the New York Times podcast, Chuck Schumer shared that belief once again. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=161.94s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=166.3s)]
*  I believe Republican senators on this issue will stand up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=167.3s)]
*  I've talked to some of them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  About five or six have said publicly they will work to uphold the courts and to uphold [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=174.66s)]
*  the law if Trump tries to break it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=180.62s)]
*  And we can do that legislatively if we have to. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=182.7s)]
*  That's my hope. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=185.76s)]
*  That's what we got to work towards. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=187.22s)]
*  And I think there's a decent chance that that would happen, particularly if Trump three [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=189.08s)]
*  months from now is less popular. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  And then if Trump goes to the highest level and violates all the court orders, I will [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=195.72000000000003s)]
*  work really hard to get a Republican. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=200.8s)]
*  This is the one place above all where a Republican colleagues should and have to stand up to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=207.12s)]
*  Okay, and despite polling looking pretty disastrous for the Democratic Party as a whole, Dems [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  like Schumer still swear their strategies are working. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=214.06s)]
*  He was defiant when Lulu Garcia Navarro, the host of that podcast, pushed him on the weak [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=218.2s)]
*  state of his party. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=223.2s)]
*  Covered a lot of countries going through Democratic backsliding all over the world. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=225.38s)]
*  And it's a very difficult process to roll back once it is underway. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  And I've seen how often opposition parties fail to recognize until it's too late that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  they might have been made irrelevant. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=243.92s)]
*  And I wonder if you think that the Democratic Party might be making that mistake. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=247.08s)]
*  No, I think we're fighting very hard on every front. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  And initially we've had some successes, but we got to keep at it and we got to be open [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  to new suggestions and ways to do it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=259.8s)]
*  But I think what we're doing is working so far. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=262.02000000000004s)]
*  Lots of voters clearly disagree. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  Jason Howard, a data analyst from Florida that NBC interviewed, said he wants Democrats to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=269.32s)]
*  fight harder. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=274.3s)]
*  They're just willing to protest silently with a little sign or wearing pink to the State [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=276.04s)]
*  of the Union address. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=282.44s)]
*  It's not enough. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=284.12s)]
*  Was, what am I missing here? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=285.12s)]
*  Where is this success in the Democratic opposition? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=288.68s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=292.32000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so here's the theory of the case I think Chuck Schumer is trying to make. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=294.36s)]
*  It's this idea of basically get out of the way and let Trump light himself on fire. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=300.56s)]
*  That's the idea, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=307.32s)]
*  That he's going to let him do all of this stuff. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=309.84s)]
*  It's going to make him deeply unpopular. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  And what he's pointing to is the stock market fluctuations and the Doge situation basically [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=316.44s)]
*  becoming more and more unpopular. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=325.64s)]
*  Trump starting off with his first ever above water approval rating in his history of his [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=328.56s)]
*  presidential career and now back to being on. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=334.0s)]
*  He's pointing to these negative signs of the public souring on Trump and saying, look, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=337.24s)]
*  we're doing a great job. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=342.68s)]
*  The public is souring on this guy. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=343.76s)]
*  Those things may be true. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  But as a party, that's not what people want. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=349.88s)]
*  People want to see the Democrats throwing everything they have plus the kitchen sink [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=354.14000000000004s)]
*  at Donald Trump and his administration and all of the things that they're trying to accomplish. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=361.62s)]
*  People want to see them working. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=367.02000000000004s)]
*  Chuck Schumer might think, well, we're above doing busy work in order to mollify our constituents. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=368.98s)]
*  I'm sorry the constituents don't agree with you, Chuck Schumer. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=375.86s)]
*  I mean, this guy is a disaster in terms of credibility and whether the base Democratic [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=379.86s)]
*  voter actually cares about this dude and believes in his leadership. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=386.58s)]
*  But yeah, his strategy is not completely without logic. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=390.42s)]
*  You can see the quote unquote logic in it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=394.1s)]
*  It's just completely flies in the face of what people want. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=397.3s)]
*  And that's the problem with the Democrats. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=401.86s)]
*  They don't want to meet people where they're at. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=403.78s)]
*  This is not what people are interested in. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=407.38000000000005s)]
*  People want to see you fight the guy that five months ago, you were calling a fascist. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=409.3s)]
*  Hitler reincarnated. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=416.98s)]
*  This is what you were doing five months ago. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=419.06s)]
*  So please do something more than sit back, kick up your feet, and let Trump destroy the state. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think the end result of that type of thinking, like you're saying, oh, well, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=430.34s)]
*  Trump will make himself unpopular, isn't an electoral win for Democrats because [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=437.7s)]
*  painting Trump as a threat or dangerous or unstable or that his decisions and policies [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=444.97999999999996s)]
*  are reckless has not been shown to be a successful electoral narrative. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=451.85999999999996s)]
*  The biggest electoral gains during Trump's career in federal politics have been in 2018 [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=458.65999999999997s)]
*  when they ran a pro healthcare campaign, giving people a proactive reason to show up and vote [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=465.38s)]
*  right on the heels of a disastrous decision. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=472.82s)]
*  Him repeatedly trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=476.5s)]
*  2018, they made big gains in the House. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=480.5s)]
*  And then in 2020, you saw agenda setting a big broad picture of policies and ideals to build [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  back better. Of course, they didn't implement as much as they could because Democrats [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=493.21999999999997s)]
*  warded those attempts. But nevertheless, they were able to defeat Trump in 2020. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  Then they reverted back this cycle. Granted, you were thrown a curveball with Biden [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=504.58s)]
*  leaving the race late. Harris was very restrained in her comments and her stances, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=509.94s)]
*  being much more pro corporate and again, resorting back to the failed electoral strategy of 2016. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=515.46s)]
*  This guy's dangerous. No, give voters something to vote for, not vote against. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=520.58s)]
*  It's not a sufficient motivator. And what you're saying here was, I'm totally with because it's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=526.66s)]
*  not going to keep people motivated. It's not going to keep people engaged. And also, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=531.62s)]
*  it's not the same as Trump 1.0. They have an agenda. They're implementing it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=535.22s)]
*  I mean, Chuck Schumer's justification for voting for the spending bill was that the destruction [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=543.0600000000001s)]
*  that Trump and Musk are doing to our federal government would get worse quicker. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=549.7s)]
*  You can agree or disagree with that read on the situation, but he's acknowledging. They are [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=554.1800000000001s)]
*  effective in what they're doing. So it can't be both things. It can't be that they're dismantling [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=559.46s)]
*  the government too fast and this will slow it down, but also he's going to be unpopular [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=564.82s)]
*  because he's a mess. No, they know what they're doing. Susie Wiles, the chief of staff, is keeping [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=569.62s)]
*  them focused. Elon Musk is running rampant and Democrats are doing nothing to stop it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=574.4200000000001s)]
*  You have to give people a proactive vision and a reason to vote, a reason to stay engaged. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=579.86s)]
*  And Democratic leadership is not doing that right now. Any final thoughts was? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=585.62s)]
*  Yeah, and we say it all the time up here, Jordan. There needs to be a counter [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=589.86s)]
*  sort of offer to the public. You need to explain to the public why government by [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=596.9s)]
*  fiat, why government by billionaire, unelected, unappointed is disastrous. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=604.5s)]
*  And you need to paint the picture that what you bring to the table is different. But instead, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=613.78s)]
*  what we get as people who would want to see the Democrats succeed is Hock Jeffries schlepping it [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=619.5400000000001s)]
*  to Silicon Valley to go fondle the fee fees of the quote unquote good billionaires over there. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=626.98s)]
*  No, no, we still got your back, guys. We're still with you. So they can't effectively message [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=636.26s)]
*  what is the most monstrous, disturbing part of the Trump agenda, which is that it's one guy [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=643.14s)]
*  after his own interests against the publics. Explain that we don't want these guys around [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=650.0999999999999s)]
*  our government. Look, you're plenty successful, bro. Get out of here. We don't work for you. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=657.8599999999999s)]
*  We work for normal, everyday Americans, but they can't make that argument because they're still [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=664.42s)]
*  in the pockets of the exact same interests. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoajiMxiIAo&t=670.98s)]
