"President Donald Trump‚Äôs secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, was roundly condemned on Tuesday over a photo op in which she accidentally pointed a gun at a border patrol officer‚Äôs head.

In the clip Noem posted to X, she stands between two officers and says, ‚ÄúHere we are with Marco and Brian today. They‚Äôre letting me roll with them. We‚Äôre going to go out and pick up somebody who I think is‚Äì got charges of human trafficking. We earlier had an op that swept up somebody that was wanted for murder. So appreciate the good work that they do every day, and we appreciate them working to make America safe.‚Äù

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Kristi Noem DRAGGED For Insane Faux Pas
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M)
*  Here we are with Marco and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=0.0s)]
*  Brian today, they let me roll with [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=1.3800000000000001s)]
*  them, we're going to go out and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=3.18s)]
*  pick up somebody who I think [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=4.72s)]
*  has got charges of human trafficking. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=6.16s)]
*  We earlier had an op that swept up [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=8.32s)]
*  somebody who was wanted for murder. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=10.72s)]
*  So appreciate the good work that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=13.32s)]
*  they do every day and we appreciate [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  them, we're going to make America [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=16.92s)]
*  safe. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=18.66s)]
*  I understand that DHS Secretary [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=21.16s)]
*  Kristi Noem likes to cosplay. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  I totally get it, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=26.2s)]
*  costumes can be fun. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=27.66s)]
*  Usually I like to see it at a hipster [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=29.56s)]
*  party, not when it comes to our [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=31.84s)]
*  federal government and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=33.76s)]
*  not in a situation when DHS Secretary [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=35.36s)]
*  is holding a gun and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=38.08s)]
*  pointing the barrel at an agent's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=39.46s)]
*  head. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=41.8s)]
*  But I'm happy to report John that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=43.6s)]
*  I'm not the only one who was really [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  worried and disturbed when seeing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=47.68s)]
*  the placement of said barrel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=49.68s)]
*  So I'm going to get to what others [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=52.36s)]
*  have said in just a moment, but [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=53.76s)]
*  what are your thoughts? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, look, every one of these [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=56.18s)]
*  little stunts, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=57.68s)]
*  initially it annoys me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=58.5s)]
*  It's the fetishizing of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=62.0s)]
*  the deportations of her wanting to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  get literally 100 officers together [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=66.0s)]
*  and load them into an 8.5 ton [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=68.88s)]
*  bear cat to get three migrants. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=71.32s)]
*  And to bring Chaya Reichik along [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  with you to live blog the entire [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=76.96s)]
*  thing, it's gross, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=79.0s)]
*  it's just really, really gross. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=80.4s)]
*  But also when you see how she [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=83.12s)]
*  seemingly is just going from one [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=85.32s)]
*  cosplay photo op to another. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=88.28s)]
*  She does it down in Venezuela, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=90.16s)]
*  she does it here, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=91.64s)]
*  she's flying a plane. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=92.6s)]
*  She's doing all that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=94.8s)]
*  There's literally no time between [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=95.52s)]
*  it. I don't think she has an office [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=97.12s)]
*  in the DHS headquarters. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=99.28s)]
*  And so while it's awful on one [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=101.64s)]
*  level, it also shows she's not [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=103.28s)]
*  really the head of DHS. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=105.16s)]
*  She's like how they treated [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  Captain America when he was first [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=109.0s)]
*  turned into Captain America and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=110.6s)]
*  they just put him on stage and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=112.0s)]
*  he did shows or whatever. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=113.24s)]
*  She's a mascot for DHS. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=114.52s)]
*  It shows they have no faith in her. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=116.6s)]
*  So they just give her little trips [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=119.24s)]
*  to take or whatever. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  And then the serious people are [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  doing the actual work. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=123.44s)]
*  And that's probably for the best [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=124.64s)]
*  because she's not really that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  qualified for the photo ops. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=128.0s)]
*  She needs to learn some trigger [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=129.64s)]
*  discipline, but she's no more [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=131.24s)]
*  qualified to do the actual work. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=133.0s)]
*  And so at least this really [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=134.84s)]
*  important very large federal [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=136.4s)]
*  bureaucracy isn't actually relying [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=138.16s)]
*  on her work. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=140.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's actually [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  a pretty good assumption because [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=144.0s)]
*  you're right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=146.0s)]
*  I mean, we see a lot of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=147.4s)]
*  performative stunts from [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=148.92s)]
*  Kristi Noem, a lot of irresponsible [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=150.68s)]
*  stuff as well, including pointing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=153.36s)]
*  the barrel of a weapon at [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=156.04s)]
*  an ICE agent's head. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=157.92s)]
*  Now, and look, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=160.2s)]
*  the other thing I'll say is, for [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=161.2s)]
*  all of the Second Amendment [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=163.32s)]
*  advocates out there, those who are [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=165.4s)]
*  proponents of looser gun [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=168.0s)]
*  regulations, come get your girl, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=170.04s)]
*  okay? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=173.0s)]
*  Because she's actually doing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=173.56s)]
*  the right thing by [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=175.88s)]
*  giving the right message to folks [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=177.4s)]
*  who want to protect the Second [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=179.72s)]
*  Amendment by being as irresponsible [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=181.84s)]
*  with that firearm as she is. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  So look, she joined these ICE [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=186.44s)]
*  agents and other law enforcement [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=188.08s)]
*  in Arizona to, as she claimed, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=189.96s)]
*  arrest, this is her statement, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=191.96s)]
*  her quote verbatim, arrest dirt [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=193.8s)]
*  bags and get them off our streets. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=195.56s)]
*  But as you can see, she was [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  pointing the weapon directly at one [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=199.52s)]
*  of the officer's heads. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=202.12s)]
*  I say critical, important rules [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to gun safety. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  So Washington Post military [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=208.04s)]
*  reporter Alex Horton replied to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=209.76s)]
*  that video, and here's what he had [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=211.72s)]
*  to say about it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  Noem is pointing the M4 muzzle at [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=214.88s)]
*  an agent with an open dust cover [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=217.48s)]
*  indicating a chambered round. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=220.0s)]
*  It's the worst possible place to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=223.28s)]
*  point it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=225.56s)]
*  No one stopped her, including [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=226.64s)]
*  the agent to her left, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=228.64s)]

*  You're going to tell DHS secretary [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=240.56s)]
*  don't do that and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=242.44s)]
*  you're going to correct her? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  We know how some in the Trump [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=245.48s)]

*  not do that, but that didn't [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=256.56s)]

*  putting her in different outfits, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=274.68s)]
*  like she's on Dora the Explorer, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=276.76s)]
*  Bob the Builder, or whatever. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  And she's sitting behind vehicles, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  she's not qualified to drive, so [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=282.48s)]
*  they just let her hold the, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't think they're putting [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  bullets in a gun that they give her. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, as far as I know, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=289.6s)]
*  there's no dogs around, so [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=290.88s)]
*  we don't have to worry about her [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=292.32s)]
*  randomly spraying to try to kill [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=293.76s)]
*  something, but still, I don't think [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=295.2s)]
*  they'd want her holding a loaded [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=297.04s)]
*  weapon. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=298.52s)]
*  Yeah, so Democratic New Mexico [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=299.04s)]

*  a former Marine, says, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=311.24s)]

*  inserted? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  If you have rounds in the chamber [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=320.28s)]
*  or in the magazine, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=321.96000000000004s)]

*  agree with. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, I'm going to fast forward to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=330.6s)]
*  her playing dress up because I [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  didn't realize until today that she [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=335.16s)]
*  really does love costumes, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=337.76s)]
*  she loves the cosplaying. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=339.76s)]
*  So in just the few past months, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=342.12s)]
*  she's put on full military fatigues, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=344.16s)]
*  let's take a look. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  Okay, having fun, there she is. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=349.24s)]
*  She loves it, she loves it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  Pretended to be a firefighter in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=353.56s)]
*  Alaska, she is, okay. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=356.56s)]
*  And donned border patrol and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=360.44s)]
*  ice uniforms complete with [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  a bulletproof vest, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  as if she's going to put herself in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  a dangerous situation and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  might get shot. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=369.12s)]
*  No, she likes to play dress up, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=370.28s)]
*  likes to play make believe. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=372.28s)]
*  In ads she may, go ahead. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=374.28s)]
*  Yeah, and you show some of them, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=376.44s)]
*  it's when she's on a mission or [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  whatever, the girl in the streets. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=379.88s)]
*  But she also went to New York and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=382.12s)]
*  she put on one of those you saw, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=383.92s)]
*  and she did an interview in [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=385.76s)]
*  the Fox News studio. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=387.32s)]
*  You literally brought a costume [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=388.48s)]
*  into a studio, you're such a joke. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=390.64s)]
*  Isn't it considered a crime to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=394.2s)]
*  pose as a member of the military [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=397.12s)]
*  when you're not? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  I would assume that if I was [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=404.64s)]
*  a member of the military, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=405.88s)]
*  I would be deeply offended by it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=407.0s)]
*  It's a strange joke. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=408.24s)]
*  So in ads she made while governor [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  of South Dakota, she dressed up as [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=413.28s)]
*  an electrician, a welder, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  a dentist and a nurse. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=417.84s)]
*  I'm really curious if she has [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=421.03999999999996s)]
*  a closet dedicated for [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=423.08s)]
*  these like cosplaying costumes. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  It's kind of incredible. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=426.96s)]
*  And yeah, there you have it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=428.32s)]
*  There you have it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=431.84s)]
*  That's Kristi Noem. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=432.4s)]
*  Our government is a joke. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=433.56s)]
*  At the moment being, yes. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  But by the way, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  what I love about this is she's [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=438.56s)]
*  the one person in the cabinet that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=440.12s)]
*  wasn't chosen who was like [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=442.32s)]
*  a TV personality. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=443.96s)]
*  And she's the one acting most like [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  a person who's just supposed to be [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=446.96s)]
*  in front of a camera. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=448.56s)]
*  Yeah, maybe she just knows what [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=450.12s)]
*  Trump likes. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=451.36s)]
*  He likes the people who look like [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=452.44s)]
*  they're out of central casting. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=454.36s)]
*  He likes the cosplaying. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=456.48s)]
*  He likes the performative nature of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=457.76s)]
*  some of these politicians. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=459.72s)]
*  And she loves to perform. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=461.56s)]
*  So there you have it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=462.6s)]
*  Kristi Noem performing sometimes in [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=463.8s)]
*  a potentially deadly way. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=466.2s)]
*  Sometimes in a fun cosplaying way [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=468.32s)]
*  that could be against the law if [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  you wore the same military fatigues. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  So there you have it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=476.52s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=478.0s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwX0ptds49M&t=479.55999999999995s)]
