"Around a fifth of the 10,000 jobs cut from the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) were done in error and will need to be corrected, the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has admitted.

Mass layoffs from the health department began this week amid a push by Donald Trump‚Äôs administration to shrink the size of the federal government workforce. Union representatives were told around 10,000 people were to lose their jobs ahead of further reductions that could see the department‚Äôs 82,000-strong workforce slashed by nearly a quarter."

# RFK Jr. Says His Employees Were Fired By DOGE On Accident
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I)
*  You're not going to believe this the Donald Trump administration may have made a mistake [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=0.0s)]
*  According to RFK jr. 20% of Doge's health agency jobs were cut by mistake [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=5.2s)]
*  whoops [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=13.3s)]
*  Cenk does that sound like you're getting rid of waste fraud and abuse [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=14.58s)]
*  Actually the most frustrating part of the story isn't that it was a mistake. It's that they're pretending it wasn't a mistake [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=20.44s)]
*  But they're saying yeah, we're reversing it because it was wrong [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=30.12s)]
*  But we meant for it to be wrong. Did you? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=34.16s)]
*  Did you let's find out well mass layoffs earlier this week cut 10,000 jobs from the HHS [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=37.6s)]
*  the Department of Health and Human Services [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=44.4s)]
*  Employees lined up outside of federal buildings in DC and Maryland some for hours to scan their badges [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=46.96s)]
*  To see if they still had a job [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=54.28s)]
*  One said we're being led through a security line like you would if you were at TSA [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=56.82s)]
*  We have to take off our shoes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=62.1s)]
*  Take out our laptops and they have to check our badge to make sure we can swipe it and then check our names against a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=64.14s)]
*  List and that's just the start [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=71.42s)]
*  Future reductions could see the department's 82,000 strong workforce slashed by nearly 25% [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=74.1s)]
*  in other words [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=80.62s)]
*  82,000 positions cut down to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=82.7s)]
*  62,000 positions the department has outlined specific job losses across a number of agencies [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=85.5s)]
*  3,500 positions at the FDA [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  2,400 at the CDC [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=95.42s)]
*  1,200 at the NIH the National Institutes of Health and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=97.94s)]
*  300 at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services these programs do things like [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=102.22s)]
*  oversee the United States food supply [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=107.78s)]
*  Monitor disease outbreaks conduct critical medical research for half the country and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=110.38s)]
*  Monitor lead exposure in children, but RFK jr. Told reporters on Thursday that Doge [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=116.38s)]
*  Elon Musk had made a mistake [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=124.06s)]
*  He stated personnel that should not have been cut were cut [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=126.3s)]
*  We're reinstating them and that was always the plan [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=130.38s)]
*  Part of the Doge we talked about this from the beginning is we're going to do 80% cuts [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=134.54000000000002s)]
*  But 20 of those 20% of those are going to have to be reinstated because we'll make mistakes [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=140.62s)]
*  It's not it's still not clear which staff will be reinstated or what functions the health department will retain [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  So Jenk, are you trusting the process? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=153.82000000000002s)]
*  What process this lunatic process where we say now look mistakes were made but we meant to make those mistakes [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=156.9s)]
*  So they weren't really mistakes [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=163.38s)]
*  What is that what are we okay? Hey, I have an idea. Why don't you plan not to make the mistake? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  Okay, that way that you'll save the trouble and by the way [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=173.42s)]
*  Look, it's fun to kid around because it's such an asinine statement the most irrational thing I've ever heard, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=176.14s)]
*  Oh, no, we plan to screw up by 20% and fire up to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=181.78s)]
*  20,000 people by accident [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=188.42s)]
*  That was your plan then you should be fired immediately both RFK junior [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk should be you should be part of the 80% that are fired [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=194.54s)]
*  Okay, we plan to fire [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=198.42s)]
*  20,000 people have their lives ruined them being an absolute panic [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  Not be able to pay the rent or their mortgage and then realize we screwed up and then rehire them [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=206.77999999999997s)]
*  That was your genius plan [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=212.7s)]
*  Come on man, come on. I mean look [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=215.82s)]
*  If that doesn't tell you everything that's wrong with Doge [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=218.94s)]
*  You're then we can say anything and you'll never believe it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=221.86s)]
*  Anyway, the minute you somebody says Doge for the Doge believers of like yes, of course [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=225.34s)]
*  You first make all the mistakes then when you try to correct some of those mistakes that shows that you never made a mistake [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=230.1s)]
*  All right, whatever dude, whatever like Orwell wrote a whole book about you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=236.66s)]
*  so now if [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=241.7s)]
*  There's one place. I don't want jobs cut [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=243.86s)]
*  It's in the health department [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=247.34s)]
*  NIH National Institute of Health [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  the FDA [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=255.18s)]
*  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=256.3s)]
*  So if you're getting Medicare or Medicaid now, you'll get less service like they did the Social Security where they closed down [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=260.06s)]
*  Six out of the you know out of the ten [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=266.22s)]
*  Service areas for Social Security now nobody can get through to Social Security because they fired so many people nobody answers the phone [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=269.1s)]
*  So they're apparently gonna do that for Medicare and Medicaid [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=275.14s)]
*  Centers for Disease Control. That's where you're gonna do your cuts by the way, not just cuts blind cuts [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=278.34s)]
*  Could it could there be? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=284.74s)]
*  Places at the CDC where you go. Oh, I see we're not doing that anymore [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=287.74s)]
*  This that research is not necessary or whatever. Yeah, of course that's possible [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=291.26s)]
*  but that requires a mind and that requires you to think about it for a second and actually analyze something instead of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=295.7s)]
*  You're all fired [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=302.7s)]
*  Oh no, we hired people who are in charge of disease and controlling it [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=304.7s)]
*  I mean we meant to we meant to now you're rehired. Oh disease already broke out [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=309.3s)]
*  We meant that too because if you're really sick [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=315.18s)]
*  That'll mean you're really healthy. We made America healthy again. You see that we had to make you sick before we can make you healthy again [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=319.02s)]
*  Wait, I think I might have just given them an idea. No, no, please please cut this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=326.78s)]
*  Okay [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=330.9s)]
*  Was yeah and I might have missed the part where they pointed out what has been made more process [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  What jobs that you know, that's under this [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  Department has been made more efficient if anything [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  We probably want stuff like the FDA to work faster, you know, like figure out what they were proving or not [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=346.78s)]
*  Faster make it quicker. I don't see how firing 20,000 people [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=354.9s)]
*  The helps in that process and sure in fact [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=359.58s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that things are probably now slower less efficient like at no point through these people ever [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=362.5s)]
*  Explained what it is. They're doing why it's supposed to work. That's why I know it's crap [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=369.58s)]
*  like they'd be bragging about the things that they've made way better if [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=375.46s)]
*  Indeed they did that but they haven't so they can't [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=380.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the you talk about junk the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=384.42s)]
*  Departments that are going to be cut and in addition to that like like you say was of course [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=387.86s)]
*  None of this is efficient making people line up like they're at TSA just to check and see if they still have a job [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=392.74s)]
*  How is that efficient? How is that saving money the personnel involved are so wasteful? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=397.74s)]
*  But then it's also transforming these departments and that's what really gets me worried [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=402.26000000000005s)]
*  So dr. Oz was confirmed to head the centers for Medicare and Medicaid [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=405.74s)]
*  Dr. Oz has been pushing Medicare Advantage plans for years that have [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=410.54s)]
*  been accused of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=415.94s)]
*  Fraud and unjust claim denials because those are the additional part C Medicare plans [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=417.82000000000005s)]
*  There are more bells and whistles promise additional coverage for Medicare beneficiaries [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=423.5s)]
*  And then those private insurers when they enter that space just deny everyone's claim so they can maximize profits [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=428.5s)]
*  He has been pushing those [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=435.66s)]
*  To his for his personal benefit for years and now he's in a position to push the government more resources behind [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=437.26s)]
*  Those plans and encourage people it some reported [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=444.54s)]
*  He might even make that the default for people to enroll in which is horrifying people are going to like you're saying Jake [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=447.58s)]
*  They're gonna get sicker [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=454.06s)]
*  But they're also going to have their claims denied as a result of these plans and they're largely gonna go unchecked by CMS [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=454.62s)]
*  Yeah, so [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=461.22s)]
*  Color me crazy [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI6yPUGjn0I&t=463.98s)]
