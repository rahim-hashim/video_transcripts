"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday used a DOGE subcommittee hearing to call for the defunding and dismantling of the company that provides NPR and PBS with federal funds.

For Taylor Greene and other House Republicans, today‚Äôs hearing was about tarnishing PBS and NPR with accusations of bias and targeting them for defunding. For the broadcasters, today was about defending their existence."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Congress GRILLS NPR CEO About Social Media Posts
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U)
*  Do you believe that white people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=0.0s)]
*  inherently feel superior to [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1.76s)]
*  other races? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  I do not. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=4.12s)]
*  You tweeted something to that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=4.88s)]
*  effect. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=6.92s)]
*  You said, I grew up feeling [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  superior, how wide of me? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=9.28s)]
*  Why did you tweet that? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=11.36s)]
*  I think I was probably reflecting [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=13.16s)]
*  on what it was to grow up in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=15.16s)]
*  an environment where I had lots of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=16.84s)]
*  advantages. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=19.04s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=20.12s)]
*  white people feel superior. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=21.72s)]
*  All right, that was NPR CEO, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=23.2s)]
*  Catherine Maher, struggling to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=25.88s)]
*  answer for some of her personal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=29.3s)]
*  social media posts as she was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=32.3s)]
*  getting grilled by Republican [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=34.92s)]
*  Congressman Brandon Gill. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=37.56s)]
*  That was the individual that you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=40.16s)]
*  saw in the video. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  He's from Texas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=43.72s)]
*  Now for me, the whole exchange [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  really did highlight something [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=47.08s)]
*  that's been going on in this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=49.4s)]
*  country in regard to corporate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=51.68s)]
*  executives, various companies. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=53.92s)]
*  And yes, even in this case, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  heads of media organizations that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=58.32s)]
*  get some of their funding from [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=60.64s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Now let me be clear, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=64.84s)]
*  the whole purpose of this hearing, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=66.04s)]
*  it was a Doge hearing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=68.2s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene is the head [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=69.56s)]
*  of the Doge committee in the House [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=71.36s)]
*  of Representatives. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=73.28s)]
*  So they do this hearing where they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  start grilling the presidents of, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=76.72s)]
*  or in the case of NPR, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  it's CEO Catherine Maher and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=80.8s)]
*  then the PBS president Paula Kurger. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=82.96s)]
*  Both organizations receive some [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=87.24s)]
*  federal funding and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=89.24s)]
*  Republicans are looking to save [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=90.56s)]
*  money by rolling back that funding, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=92.64s)]
*  basically cutting them off entirely. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=94.92s)]
*  I don't know why NPR takes [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  the money, they only get 1% of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=98.88s)]
*  their funding from the federal [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=101.12s)]
*  government. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=103.16s)]
*  So if I were the CEO of NPR, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  my take would be, we're going to be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=106.04s)]
*  I without the 1%. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=108.44s)]
*  I don't want to deal with Congress, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=110.16s)]
*  I don't want to deal with this mess, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=112.28s)]
*  okay? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  I just want to be done with it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=114.84s)]
*  So we'll find our resources [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=116.08s)]
*  someplace else, okay? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=117.56s)]
*  We'll do an extra fundraiser. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=118.84s)]
*  Anything to avoid this annoying [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  politicized nonsense, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=122.56s)]
*  that's my take on it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=124.08s)]
*  PBS is a little bit of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  a different story. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=126.76s)]
*  They receive 15% of their funding [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=127.48s)]
*  from the federal government. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=129.08s)]
*  So they stand to really be harmed [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=130.16s)]
*  by what Republicans in the House [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=131.96s)]
*  are trying to do here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=133.6s)]
*  And it's frustrating because I [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=134.76s)]
*  actually think PBS is very [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  different from NPR in terms of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  the quality of journalism. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  Frontline documentaries, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=142.56s)]
*  they've got a whole channel on [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  YouTube, please check it out. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=146.04s)]
*  Their documentaries are excellent, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=147.68s)]
*  in depth, hard hitting, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=150.88s)]
*  really important information. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=152.92s)]
*  Now NPR does some good reporting, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=155.72s)]
*  I'm sure, but it's just, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=157.24s)]
*  I see the argument. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=158.72s)]
*  I partly agree with the argument [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=160.92s)]
*  that you kind of get one side of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=163.12s)]
*  the story with NPR sometimes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  And I don't appreciate that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=167.44s)]
*  And especially if you're receiving [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=169.44s)]
*  federal resources, you really [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=171.4s)]
*  should be fair in how you cover [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=173.24s)]
*  certain issues or certain stories. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=174.84s)]
*  So with all of that context in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=176.44s)]
*  mind, I just thought this exchange [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=178.48s)]
*  with Catherine Maher was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  fascinating because she did put [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=182.76s)]
*  these posts on X, Twitter at [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=185.16s)]
*  the time, and she's having [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=187.28s)]
*  a difficult time defending them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=189.36s)]
*  So let's just watch a little more [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=193.52s)]
*  of what happened, take a look. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=195.36s)]
*  Do you believe that America is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=198.24s)]
*  addicted to white supremacy? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=200.0s)]
*  I believe that I tweeted that and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=201.8s)]
*  as I've said earlier, I believe [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=203.6s)]
*  much of my thinking has evolved [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=205.48s)]
*  over the last half decade. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=207.32s)]
*  It has evolved, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  why did you tweet that? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=209.92s)]
*  I don't recall the exact context, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=211.76s)]
*  sir, so [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=213.6s)]
*  I wouldn't be able to say. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=214.12s)]
*  Okay, do you believe that America [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=215.6s)]
*  believes in black plunder and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=217.8s)]
*  white democracy? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=219.64s)]
*  I don't believe that, sir. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=220.8s)]
*  You tweeted that in reference to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=223.6s)]
*  a book you were reading at the time, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=225.24s)]
*  apparently, The Case for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=227.0s)]
*  Reparations. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=228.28s)]
*  I don't think I've ever read that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=229.8s)]
*  book, sir. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=231.16s)]

*  Apologies, I don't recall that I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=241.28s)]
*  did. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=242.72s)]
*  Do you think that white people [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=243.24s)]

*  I have never said that, sir. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=245.68s)]
*  Yes, you did. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=247.88s)]
*  You said it in January of 2020, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=249.12s)]
*  you tweeted, yes, the North, yes, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  all of us, yes, America, yes, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=252.88s)]

*  yes, on this day. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=258.34s)]
*  I don't believe that was a reference [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  to fiscal reparations, sir. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  What kind of reparations was it [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  a reference to? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=264.0s)]
*  I think it was just a reference to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=265.12s)]
*  the idea that we all owe much to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  the people who came before us. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=268.28s)]
*  That's a bizarre way to frame what [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=270.0s)]
*  you tweeted. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=272.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=275.0s)]

*  That was not good. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=279.28s)]
*  Okay, so she didn't read that book. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  She wanted credit for [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=284.35999999999996s)]
*  allegedly reading that book, which [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=285.6s)]
*  is why she did the virtue signal [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=287.68s)]
*  tweet about like, I'm a goody. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=289.52s)]
*  I'm not a baddy, I'm a goody. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=291.44s)]
*  I read the case for reparations and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=292.84s)]
*  then forgot that she lied about [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=295.04s)]
*  that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=297.0s)]
*  And then five years later, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=298.24s)]
*  a Republican congressman is asking [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=299.92s)]
*  her about it and she's like, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=302.08s)]
*  I never read that book. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  I just wanted to do the equivalent [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=305.4s)]
*  of putting a Black Lives Matter [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=307.68s)]
*  sign in front of my business [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  without really giving a damn, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=311.6s)]
*  really. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=313.68s)]
*  I just wanted to engage in that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=314.68s)]
*  performative stuff and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  get credit for that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=317.24s)]
*  Okay, it was bad, okay? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  Now look, that congressman, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  Brandon Gill, he came prepared. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=324.36s)]
*  Not every Republican came prepared [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=327.56s)]
*  and you're going to get a little [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=329.12s)]
*  taste of that in just a minute. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  Okay, but before we do, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=331.6s)]
*  I thought this other exchange with [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=333.36s)]
*  Congressman Gill was really [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  interesting, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=337.8s)]
*  Because when it comes to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=339.76s)]
*  the performative virtue signaling [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=341.48s)]
*  stuff, she engaged in it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=344.44s)]
*  We have evidence, this is the tweet [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=346.52s)]
*  that he was referencing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=348.24s)]
*  Yes, the North, yes, all of us, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=349.64s)]
*  yes, America, yes, our original [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=351.48s)]
*  collective sin and unpaid debt, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=353.4s)]
*  yes, reparations, yes, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=355.32s)]
*  on the stage. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=356.72s)]
*  So she did tweet these things and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=357.52s)]
*  had difficulty denying it, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=359.56s)]
*  She's stumbling, she's bumbling, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=361.92s)]
*  she's saying she evolved from [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=363.96s)]
*  those positions, interesting, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=365.52s)]
*  okay? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=367.44s)]
*  But she had a quick answer when he [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=367.96s)]
*  asked her something else. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=370.12s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=372.32s)]
*  Ms. Maher, I want to start with [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=374.8s)]
*  you just generally. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=376.48s)]
*  Would you say you generally agree [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=377.96s)]
*  or disagree with the following [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=379.76s)]
*  statement? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=381.36s)]
*  The history of all hitherto [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=381.88s)]
*  existing society is the history of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=383.44s)]
*  class struggles? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=385.4s)]
*  I would not say I agree with that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=387.36s)]
*  You're not, that's good to hear. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=388.76s)]
*  It's interesting because a lot of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=390.36s)]
*  your thinking as expressed by your [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=392.04s)]
*  public statements is deeply [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  infused with economic and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=395.44s)]
*  cultural Marxism. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=396.96s)]
*  I didn't see the examples of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=400.48s)]
*  economic Marxism at all. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=402.68s)]
*  In fact, she was real quick to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=404.72s)]
*  deny that and say I disagree with [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=408.36s)]
*  And that is what stood out to me [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=408.88s)]
*  the most about this whole, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=410.88s)]
*  it's kabuki theater, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=412.52s)]
*  it's a show trial, whatever. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't really care about [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=415.92s)]
*  the hearings at this point because [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  I know what they're really [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=418.48s)]
*  intended to do. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=419.56s)]
*  It's about getting your sound bite [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=420.2s)]
*  as a politician. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=421.64s)]
*  Congratulations, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=422.56s)]
*  Congressman Gill, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=423.48s)]
*  you did a good job with that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=424.36s)]
*  And will they strip these [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=425.72s)]
*  organizations of their funding? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=427.24s)]
*  Probably, I mean, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=429.24s)]
*  Republicans are in charge right [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=430.0s)]
*  now, I don't know if they're going [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=431.56s)]
*  to have enough time to do it before [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  the midterms, but probably, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=434.56s)]
*  we'll see. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=436.04s)]
*  But what I just thought was so [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=436.6s)]
*  interesting is that she again is [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=438.6s)]
*  the embodiment of the performative [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=440.96000000000004s)]

*  guys, the culture wars are easy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=449.12s)]
*  It's easy to get kudos by simply [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=451.92s)]
*  saying that you support [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  Black Lives Matter. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=456.08000000000004s)]

*  that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=466.36s)]

*  I won't even acknowledge [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=495.04s)]

*  I don't agree with that at all. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=498.44s)]
*  I just thought that was [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=500.36s)]
*  interesting. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=501.04s)]
*  Anyway, so as I was mentioning, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=501.56s)]
*  CBS was also included in this [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=505.84000000000003s)]

*  I actually thought the head of CBS [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=511.40000000000003s)]

*  defending the organization. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  Because I honestly think that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=519.0s)]
*  PBS does a really good job. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=520.6s)]
*  I learned English thanks to PBS. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=523.6s)]
*  English is not my first language, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=526.72s)]
*  it's my second language. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=527.92s)]
*  When I started elementary school, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=528.8s)]
*  when I started kindergarten, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=530.52s)]
*  I didn't speak a word of English. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=532.04s)]
*  And I was deeply ashamed because I [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=533.36s)]
*  didn't even realize that there's [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=535.32s)]
*  a whole language that I don't [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=537.32s)]
*  speak, I don't understand. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=539.04s)]
*  So when I started school, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=541.12s)]
*  that humiliation made me very [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=542.64s)]
*  motivated to learn English as [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=544.4s)]
*  quickly as possible. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=546.12s)]
*  So I would wake up before my [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=547.28s)]
*  parents would wake up every [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=548.7199999999999s)]

*  a morning person and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  I would watch Sesame Street. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=552.28s)]
*  And that's how I learned English, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=554.4799999999999s)]
*  it helped me catch up to my [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=556.4399999999999s)]

*  you need to tell the whole story. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=756.6800000000001s)]
*  And so I'm going to end with this [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=758.72s)]
*  because as I mentioned, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=761.2s)]
*  Congressman Gill was very prepared. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=763.12s)]
*  He came with the receipts. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=767.5600000000001s)]
*  James Comer though struggled a [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=769.5600000000001s)]
*  little bit during this hearing. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=771.5600000000001s)]
*  So he had a hard time [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=773.7600000000001s)]
*  understanding what words mean. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=775.84s)]
*  So let's take a look at that. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=779.12s)]
*  One of the first things that I did [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=780.36s)]
*  in coming in in May was to beef up [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=782.44s)]
*  our editorial standards. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=784.52s)]
*  I directed my editor in chief, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=786.04s)]
*  who by the way- [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=787.76s)]
*  Why is NPR even doing editorials? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=788.6s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=790.4s)]
*  I don't mean editorial in terms of [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=791.6s)]
*  opinion editorial. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=793.6s)]
*  What does it matter with the opinion? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=795.2s)]
*  If you're a federally funded [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=797.84s)]
*  entity that's supposed to provide [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=799.92s)]
*  the news, can you not provide [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=802.28s)]
*  the news? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=804.64s)]
*  Of course, Congressman, I mean, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=805.64s)]
*  I'm not going to be a judge. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=807.6s)]
*  Of course, Congressman, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=809.6s)]
*  I mean editorial standards for [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=810.88s)]
*  our journalism was to beef up our [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=812.48s)]
*  editorial practices, bringing in [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=814.24s)]
*  more editors to make sure that we [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=816.1999999999999s)]
*  have more points of view reflected. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=817.88s)]
*  To be fair, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=822.36s)]
*  it could be a little bit confusing. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=822.88s)]
*  But yeah, when let's say I [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  mentioned that an advertiser has no [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=827.88s)]
*  editorial say over the main show. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=831.8399999999999s)]
*  That means they don't get to have [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=836.24s)]
*  any input in regard to what we [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=838.6800000000001s)]
*  choose to cover, when we cover it, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=840.72s)]
*  how we cover it. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=843.32s)]
*  That's what editorial control [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=844.64s)]
*  means, right? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=846.44s)]
*  That's separate from writing an [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=847.48s)]
*  opinion piece or an editorial. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=849.64s)]
*  So I get that it can be a little [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=852.24s)]
*  bit confusing, but this is [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=853.36s)]
*  the problem with Congress right [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=854.52s)]
*  now. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=855.96s)]
*  And it's not just in regard to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=856.36s)]
*  lack of knowledge in how media [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=858.5600000000001s)]
*  works, it's lack of knowledge in [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=860.88s)]
*  how a lot of things work. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=863.36s)]
*  I mean, have you ever watched [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=865.76s)]
*  a hearing on something related to [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=867.0s)]
*  the tech industry? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=868.4s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=869.28s)]
*  It's just this lack of intellectual [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=871.76s)]
*  curiosity because look, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=874.4399999999999s)]
*  these are members of Congress. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=876.4399999999999s)]
*  These are actually ordinary people [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  in most cases. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=880.72s)]
*  You can't expect them to be [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=881.84s)]
*  experts in everything. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=883.0s)]
*  But you guys want to call this [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=884.4399999999999s)]
*  performative theater hearing, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=886.3199999999999s)]
*  then at least have the willingness, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=888.56s)]
*  the intellectual curiosity to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=890.9599999999999s)]
*  understand the subject that you're [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=892.84s)]
*  about to have a hearing about. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=895.0s)]
*  But that's the thing, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=896.68s)]
*  it's not really about finding [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=897.56s)]
*  solutions. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=899.0s)]
*  It's not really about fixing [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=899.6s)]
*  something that's broken. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=901.16s)]
*  It's really about getting your [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=902.6s)]
*  little sound bite to give this [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=904.84s)]
*  illusion that you're working. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=907.12s)]
*  It's the illusion of governance. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=909.48s)]
*  There's really nothing going on [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  though, okay? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=913.92s)]
*  Congress has been broken for [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=914.76s)]
*  a long time. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=916.0799999999999s)]
*  They're not interested in passing [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=916.64s)]
*  legislation to reform all [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=918.64s)]
*  the different areas of this [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=920.0799999999999s)]
*  country that desperately need [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=921.52s)]
*  reforms that desperately need to [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=923.12s)]
*  be fixed. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=924.72s)]
*  It's a mess. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=926.12s)]
*  But if you're going to do [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=928.12s)]
*  the performative thing, Comer, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=929.52s)]
*  you got to at least understand what [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=931.84s)]
*  editorial input or [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=934.0s)]
*  editorial control means. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=935.24s)]
*  It was not a good moment for Comer, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=937.12s)]
*  but to be quite frank, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=939.28s)]
*  that hearing wasn't a great moment [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=940.6800000000001s)]
*  for the head of NPR either. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=942.88s)]
*  Give up the 1%, seriously. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=945.4s)]
*  I really don't think they need [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=947.8s)]
*  the money, but for whatever reason [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=949.36s)]
*  they're latching on like crazy. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=951.24s)]
*  And as a result, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=953.08s)]
*  they've got to deal with hearings [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=953.8s)]
*  like this, so I guess enjoy. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=955.36s)]
*  But if you're going to take [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=957.3199999999999s)]
*  the public money, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  you got to tell the full story. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=959.0s)]
*  One final thing I'll leave you [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=960.12s)]
*  with is this, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=961.4s)]
*  let's go to graphic two. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=962.0s)]
*  In DC where NPR is headquartered, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=963.68s)]
*  this is from the piece written by [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=965.76s)]
*  a former NPR senior editor. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=967.6s)]
*  And many of us where NPR is [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=969.84s)]
*  headquartered and many of us live, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  I found 87 registered Democrats [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=973.76s)]
*  working in editorial positions and [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=975.88s)]
*  zero Republicans, none. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=978.2s)]
*  I think diversity is important and [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=981.28s)]
*  it's not just about race or [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=983.36s)]
*  nationality. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=985.28s)]
*  It's also about ideological [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  diversity. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=988.36s)]
*  Because when you have that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  ideological diversity, well, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=991.16s)]
*  you might be exposed to a [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=993.28s)]
*  perspective that you otherwise [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=994.96s)]
*  wouldn't be exposed to as [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=996.96s)]
*  a journalist specifically. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=998.64s)]
*  I have people who open my mind to [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1001.36s)]
*  all sorts of things because they [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1003.28s)]
*  bring up perspectives that I hadn't [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1005.28s)]
*  considered because those [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1007.64s)]
*  experiences are not part of my [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1009.28s)]
*  lived experience. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1011.28s)]
*  Doesn't mean I'm always going to [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1013.12s)]
*  agree with them, but at least I [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1014.4s)]
*  understand things a little bit [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1015.72s)]
*  better or at least I understand [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1017.24s)]
*  the rationale of people that I [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1018.9200000000001s)]
*  disagree with. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1020.64s)]
*  And that makes you a better [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1022.64s)]
*  journalist, it makes you a better [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1023.72s)]
*  news organization. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1025.1200000000001s)]
*  So if you're again, pretending to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1026.2s)]
*  be fair and balanced, because you [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1028.2s)]
*  want to take the public dollars, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1030.2s)]
*  you're going to get called out [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1032.0s)]
*  when you're not actually balanced [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1033.6s)]
*  in your reporting. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1035.3600000000001s)]
*  So that's what's happening with NPR. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1036.56s)]
*  PBS though, they got to come with [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1037.68s)]
*  some more receipts because I [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1039.3600000000001s)]
*  honestly didn't see them making a [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1040.96s)]
*  good case for stripping PBS of [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1042.96s)]
*  their funding. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1044.88s)]
*  And 15% is not a small amount, so [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1046.64s)]
*  we'll see what happens. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1048.3600000000001s)]
*  But I really, really hope they [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6PTWEmj1U&t=1049.4s)]
