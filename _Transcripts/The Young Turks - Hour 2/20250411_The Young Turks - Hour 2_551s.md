TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Jamie Dimon Makes Predictions About Gen Z Life
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI)
*  incredibly wealthy man tells young people not to worry about money or the future. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=0.0s)]
*  As long as there's no nuclear war, you good. Take a look. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=5.12s)]
*  These kids, anyone who's depressed, as long as we don't have nuclear war, they're gonna [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=9.68s)]
*  have an unreal life. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  That is Jamie Dimon, CEO of the nation's largest bank, JP Morgan Chase, optimistic about a [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=16.64s)]
*  future he won't be around for. Dimon thinks that technology advances and what's being [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=22.76s)]
*  called the great wealth transfer will lead to longer and more prosperous lives for Gen [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=28.24s)]
*  Z and Gen Alpha. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  He thinks young people should just focus on their own growth and well-being and just work [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  hard. More from Dimon, take a look at this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=38.2s)]
*  People say their next generation's in bad shape. Really? They're gonna inherit a country [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=41.58s)]
*  that's worth two, three hundred trillion dollars. They're probably gonna live to 120. AI is [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=45.2s)]
*  gonna cure some cancers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=51.2s)]
*  They shouldn't be bemoaning the situation. They should be looking at this world and saying, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=53.04s)]
*  what can I make of it? What can I do better than the folks before me? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=56.76s)]
*  Some of that advice good. Some of it does not track at all. Who cares if the country [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  you're in is rich if you don't get any significant chunk of that money for your own life? But [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=65.88s)]
*  don't listen to me. I'm not very wealthy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=72.4s)]
*  Despite Gen Z's concerns about their finances, data does in good news apparently show that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=74.72s)]
*  these concerns to a degree may be short lived. For example, Gen Zers, people born between [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=79.2s)]
*  1997 and 2012 say that they are having a turned down job opportunities because they can't [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=84.36s)]
*  afford commuting expenses and have decided to focus on their pets in lieu of having children [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  because kids have become too expensive to raise. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=94.36s)]
*  In addition, they're abandoning their dreams of owning a home soon unless they believe [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=97.92s)]
*  they'll receive an inheritance soon. This cash strapped present may prove a contrast [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=102.0s)]
*  to their wealthy future. However, with the great wealth transfer estimated trickle around [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=107.76s)]
*  $84 trillion from the baby boomer and silent generations to their younger relatives. Indeed, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  the shift will be so great that millennials are expected to be the wealthiest generation [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=117.44s)]
*  in history in the coming two decades. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=120.92s)]
*  I will believe it when I see it. And if you don't believe me, just ask my one and only [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=123.4s)]
*  son Henry Horse. Henry. I can just barely afford to take care of. That's not true, but [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=128.72s)]
*  you get the point. Diamond also thinks that AI will significantly shorten the work week [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=135.24s)]
*  to just 3.5 days, he told Bloomberg News. Please, Lord, let that be true. I want that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=139.92s)]
*  more than anything. Let it happen right now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=146.2s)]
*  The banking chief who's paid $39 million a year just in 2024 alone recommends young people [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=148.32s)]
*  get off social media telling Maria Bartiromo, take care of yourself. If you don't take care [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=154.64s)]
*  of your mind, your body, your spirit, your soul, your friends, your family, you're not [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=160.48s)]
*  going to have a great life and enjoy it. Have a little heart and humanity. Treat people [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=164.56s)]
*  properly. The way I grew up, the way you treat everyone is fair and honest and forthright. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=169.36s)]
*  And you'll have a great life. This from the CEO of JP Morgan Chase Bank. He added, work [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=175.8s)]
*  hard, learn, learn, learn, read everybody. Don't get into the ecosystem of Democrats, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=183.4s)]
*  progressive, learn from everybody else. Great, great advice from a man who really keeps that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=189.56s)]
*  common touch. I'm inspired, Cenk. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=196.56s)]
*  Yeah, so it sounds like he's giving advice to his kids. And for his kids, those are actually [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=200.4s)]
*  probably pretty good advice. Like, what are you worried about? You crazy? Don't worry, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to leave you like hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions. I run the largest [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=208.88000000000002s)]
*  bank. Are you crazy? Just at the top of your life. And so if you're Jamie Dimon's kids, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=213.24s)]
*  really, I agree with that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=217.52s)]
*  I think rich people don't enjoy their money enough. Like, no, I want to pass the next [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  guy on the Forbes 400 list. And they get into this greed swirl. And so wonderful advice [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=223.52s)]
*  if you're the son of the CEO of the largest bank. But for the rest of us, brother, I mean, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  be a little self-aware. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=239.4s)]
*  So okay, now here's the thing. Again, two things can be true at the same time. Look, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  has health improved over the last 200 years, life expectancy, etc.? Yes, unquestionably. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=246.6s)]
*  Are there enormously positive trends in the world? Absolutely. Should you view yourself [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=253.8s)]
*  as a victim of uncontrollable forces and just surrender? No, absolutely not. Go out there [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=259.98s)]
*  and tackle the world. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=265.48s)]
*  That stuff is true. At the same time, Jamie Dimon never and no one in power, none of these [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=266.48s)]
*  elites ever acknowledge. Yes, but it's harder today. So don't gaslight us and keep telling [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=271.18s)]
*  us about, don't worry about it, just work hard. Yeah, okay, but you guys bought houses [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=277.5s)]
*  for like $35,000. Right now houses are sky high and adjusted for inflation. These numbers [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=283.38s)]
*  are still much, much, much higher than they used to be, including the cost of college [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=291.74s)]
*  education, including the cost of raising kids. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=295.86s)]
*  So all of the price have gone up and have our wages gone up. No, because of elites [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=298.86s)]
*  like Jamie Dimon basically completely controlling our politicians. All we ever did was trickle [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  down economics. So what they do, corporate tax cuts, tax cuts for the rich, deregulation [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=307.86s)]
*  for banks. And next thing you know, oops, yeah, we crashed the entire world economy [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=313.14s)]
*  in 2008. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=317.5s)]
*  Well, then I'm gonna need bailouts and I'm gonna need you to pay American taxpayers to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=318.5s)]
*  pay my bonuses during bailouts. There's never any responsibility. There's never any consequences [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=323.1s)]
*  because they've captured the government. But meanwhile, that crash cost the jobs of like [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=328.70000000000005s)]
*  12 to 13 million people. It robbed the taxpayers of so much money and we now have less to invest [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=334.06s)]
*  in the younger generation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=341.1s)]
*  So we can't do free college education, which would empower those people and give those [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=343.04s)]
*  kids a quality of opportunity so they could go out and tackle the world. So if you're [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=347.94s)]
*  gonna tell them to go tackle the world, give them the tools to do that with. But anytime [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=352.38s)]
*  somebody proposes that the Jamie Dimons little world come on, girl, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no free college. No free, not free, but no [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  universal health care, no paid family leave, no higher minimum wage, no nothing for you [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=366.58s)]
*  guys, only tax cuts for people like me. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=371.78s)]
*  So please spare me that speech. I'm happy to hear that from someone else, but not from [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=374.53999999999996s)]
*  Jamie Dimon. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=378.56s)]
*  Yeah, and like you pointed out, there's certain things that some people may have access to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=379.56s)]
*  that are better like overall, like access to food, health care. We got grocery stores now [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  and stuff, but what we're really talking about is the ability to assimilate and not really [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=389.53999999999996s)]
*  integrate, which is really what happened during integration here. Some people can make it [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=396.3s)]
*  through the cracks, but most people can't. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=400.82s)]
*  So if you especially in today's time, as you pointed out with like housing, education, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=403.62s)]
*  health care, things like that being so expensive, consumer goods have been keeping the economy [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=410.5s)]
*  afloat. These tariffs are messing that up. But unless you're a rather exceptional person [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=415.7s)]
*  in today's economy, like really good looking, really charismatic, maybe a really smart something [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=423.66s)]
*  that you're not really going to rise through the cracks. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=431.1s)]
*  It's really difficult to climb the social ladder, to climb the tax bracket in America. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=433.3s)]
*  The American dream is not really attainable unless you're a rather exceptional person, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=439.3s)]
*  which more and more people are having to run into. So yeah, you might be able to assimilate, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=443.54s)]
*  but I mean, look at the stats, look at how many people are in debt. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=448.22s)]
*  So Jamie Dimon, he's just kind of saying stuff because it sounds good, kind of like old grandpa, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=452.82s)]
*  like you said, giving his kids some good advice, but clearly he's not familiar with the struggles [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=458.62s)]
*  that most people go through just trying to stay afloat. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and one last quick thing here. Yeah, things might have improved in the last 200 [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=466.62s)]
*  years, but in the last 50 years, because of trickle down economics, which Jamie Dimon [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=470.58s)]
*  loves, our wages have been absolutely flat adjusted for inflation for 50 long, brutal [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=475.29999999999995s)]
*  years. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gspTt1LkBI&t=482.7s)]
