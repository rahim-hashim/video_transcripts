"The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily paused a court-imposed midnight deadline to return to the US a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, agreeing to a request from President Donald Trump that will give the justices more time to consider the case.

Chief Justice John Roberts granted the ‚Äúadministrative stay,‚Äù a move that will extend the deadline until the court hands down a more fulsome decision in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was deported on March 15."

# SCOTUS Makes MAJOR Ruling In Trump's Favor
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk)
*  A lower court judge on Friday night ruled against you with respect to Kilmar Armando [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=0.0s)]
*  Abrego Garcia, who is somebody who was living in Maryland. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=5.14s)]
*  He was under an order not to be deported because of fears or danger that he may face back in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=9.16s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  The government has admitted there was an error in deporting him. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  But this judge has said you've got a deadline midnight Monday to get him back from El Salvador. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=18.42s)]
*  Well, not anymore because the Supreme Court has just weighed in and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=25.14s)]
*  they are helping the Trump administration by temporarily pausing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=29.72s)]
*  the court imposed midnight deadline to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=34.7s)]
*  The Maryland man by the way, mistakenly deported to El Salvador back to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=41.7s)]
*  the United States. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=46.28s)]
*  In fact, there's a huge breaking story as we speak because the Supreme Court has [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=48.06s)]
*  weighed in on whether or not the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=53.14s)]
*  which is a wartime law to deport alleged gang members. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=59.9s)]
*  Venezuelan gang members specifically were at the heart of this case. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=64.82s)]
*  And the Supreme Court on Monday, meaning today, removed this temporary block on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=68.78s)]
*  the Trump administration's use of a controversial wartime authority to deport [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=72.98s)]
*  alleged members of the Venezuelan gang. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  Ruling against the immigrants essentially who are challenging this action by the Trump [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=83.82s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=87.5s)]
*  They write in their decision that the detainees are confined, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=89.14s)]
*  I should say in Texas. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=93.66s)]
*  So venue is improper in the District of Columbia, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=95.46s)]
*  the justices wrote of the challenge in the US District Court in DC. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=98.86s)]
*  As a result, the government is likely to succeed on the merits of this action. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=103.38000000000001s)]
*  So the five to four ruling, of course, the liberal justices ruled against [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=107.86s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=112.62s)]
*  The conservative justices did not touch on the underlying legal questions of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=113.58s)]
*  the challenge, according to the Washington Post. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=118.58s)]
*  It leaves open the possibility the migrants could refile their case in Texas or [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  other jurisdictions where they are detained. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=125.78s)]
*  But I want to get back to, Abrego Garcia in just a moment, but Cenk, first you [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=129.06s)]
*  jump in. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=133.74s)]
*  Yeah, so look, it might be a fig leaf because it's just a jurisdictional issue. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=134.62s)]
*  Where they hold the case is relevant because it depends, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=138.98000000000002s)]
*  you'll get a different judge and a more conservative judge in Texas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=141.66000000000003s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it's going to go to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=145.18s)]
*  So this could be a small victory that they hand Trump, especially if they're [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=147.38s)]
*  planning to rule against them later on the substance of the case. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=152.38s)]
*  But now I'm speculating, I have no idea which way they're going to rule on [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=155.58s)]
*  the substance of the case. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=158.46s)]
*  But one thing I do know is that the courts are the most important part of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=159.78s)]
*  this entire equation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=165.02s)]
*  If the courts don't hold, we're all screwed and there is no remedy, okay? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=166.66s)]
*  The courts have to actually follow the law and the Constitution. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=171.10000000000002s)]
*  They don't have to rule against Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=174.86s)]
*  They just have to rule against him or [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  anyone else if he violates the Constitution or the laws. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  And he has to follow court orders. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=182.34s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=183.94s)]
*  In a sense here, they bought time on the original case that Anna's going to go [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  back to so that Trump can follow the court's orders. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  And I'm sure that Justice Roberts had that in mind when he did this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=193.14s)]
*  Yes. Because the number one thing he's trying to preserve is the court's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=197.82s)]
*  authority, which is a good thing that he's doing that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=200.62s)]
*  Right, so Chief Justice John Roberts agreed to a request from [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=203.06s)]
*  President Trump to give both sides more time essentially to make their arguments. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=208.18s)]
*  Okay, so again, as it relates to Kilmar, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=214.54s)]
*  Abrego Garcia, this is a temporary decision, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=218.04s)]
*  This isn't a permanent decision in regard to what Trump can and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=222.06s)]
*  can't do when it comes to specific migrants who were deported in this case, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=225.86s)]
*  mistakenly. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=230.42s)]
*  And that's not based on my interpretation. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=231.9s)]
*  That's based on the lawyers representing the Trump administration in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=234.1s)]
*  this particular case. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=236.74s)]
*  Now he ordered lawyers in the case to respond by 5 PM Tuesday. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=238.22s)]
*  The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that the lower court's order to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=244.26s)]
*  return the man was unprecedented and could not be done. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=249.22s)]
*  Because the man that they admit they mistakenly deported to El Salvador, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=254.54s)]
*  okay, to an absolute hellhole, CICOT, that facility to detain terrorists and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=259.74s)]
*  gang members. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=264.5s)]
*  They're like, well, he's in El Salvadorian custody now, so [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=266.06s)]
*  we can't get him back. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=269.14s)]
*  Solicitor General John Sawyer told the Supreme Court in his filing on Monday, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=270.70000000000005s)]
*  even amidst a deluge of unlawful injunctions, this order is remarkable. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=277.18s)]
*  The Constitution charges the President, not federal district courts, with the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  terrorists, including by effectuating their removal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=291.94000000000005s)]
*  While the United States concedes that removal to El Salvador was [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=295.38s)]
*  an administrative error that does not license district courts to seize control [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=299.78s)]
*  over foreign relations, treat the executive branch as a subordinate diplomat, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=306.26s)]
*  and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=311.61999999999995s)]
*  into America tonight. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=316.82s)]
*  Okay, the guy that we're talking about here is not a foreign terrorist. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  The guy that we're talking about right now is someone who was in the country [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=324.17999999999995s)]
*  illegally and by the Trump administration's own admission was [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=327.66s)]
*  mistakenly deported to another country without any due process. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=332.5s)]
*  So but I want you to understand what they're saying. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=338.26s)]
*  They're saying, yeah, we know we made a mistake and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=340.3s)]
*  sent the wrong guy to that torture prison, but we refuse to get him out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=342.38s)]
*  And we don't want to deal with the courts. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=346.94s)]
*  We don't think the court should have a say, essentially. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=348.14s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, we can't get him out even if we wanted to, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=350.46s)]
*  because that's the business of El Salvador. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=353.14s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=355.06s)]
*  You're telling me you sent people to that hellhole and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=355.74s)]
*  including wrong people, innocent people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=358.38s)]
*  And you think you have no way of getting them out if you made a mistake? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=360.86s)]
*  What if you sent an American citizen? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=364.18s)]
*  What if you sent someone like that? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=366.3s)]
*  And so this idea that they don't have any control over El Salvador and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=368.74s)]
*  they can't get people back is nothing but a giant and obvious lie. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=371.62s)]
*  Of course they can get them back. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=375.82s)]
*  The fact that they're saying we know he's innocent, but we don't want him back and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=377.38s)]
*  we want him tortured in that prison is unbelievable. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=380.26s)]
*  And then finally to say, the courts have no role in telling us, or [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=383.78s)]
*  the executive branch, what to do. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  No, that's literally the job of the courts. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=389.38s)]
*  They said, well, we declared him a foreign terrorist. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=391.46s)]
*  Well, how do we know he's a foreign terrorist? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=393.29999999999995s)]
*  That's what the courts are supposed to decide, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=396.05999999999995s)]
*  whether he's a terrorist or not. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=398.02s)]
*  Otherwise, you could just pick up any American citizen, send him to a dungeon [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=399.5s)]
*  in El Salvador and go, well, we decided he was a foreign terrorist and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=402.97999999999996s)]
*  we don't care. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=406.05999999999995s)]
*  Even under oath, the Department of Justice has been unable to give a clear [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=407.82s)]
*  answer as to why they are unable to return Garcia to the United States. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=413.58s)]
*  Press by US District Judge Paula Zinnis about why the US couldn't bring him back. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=418.41999999999996s)]
*  DOJ lawyer, Arez Rouveni says this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=423.82s)]
*  The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=428.02s)]
*  question. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=432.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=434.62s)]
*  Yeah, and here's my question. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=435.26s)]
*  How can he be innocent and a foreign terrorist at the same time? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=437.02s)]
*  They make the most asinine, ridiculous comments in court and their own lawyer. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=440.82s)]
*  We covered it at the end of last week, that same guy that Ana just quoted. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=447.82s)]
*  When the judge asked them under what authority are you doing this? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=451.98s)]
*  He said, honestly, I don't know. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=454.9s)]
*  I'm asking the same questions. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=456.3s)]
*  They go in totally unprepared, don't care about American laws and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=457.53999999999996s)]
*  the American Constitution at all. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=461.86s)]
*  And now they're sending innocent people and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=464.98s)]
*  saying we'll never get him back even if we think they're innocent. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=466.86s)]
*  And Trump wants to send Americans to that facility in El Salvador, literally. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=469.42s)]
*  He said it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=475.46000000000004s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=476.34000000000003s)]
*  And so if you think it's hyperbolic to say that they would do this to Americans. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=476.86s)]
*  No, Trump literally said he would like to do it to Americans. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=480.14000000000004s)]
*  And if he sends one of you to a dungeon, to a different country, and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=483.66s)]
*  guess what he'll say? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=486.74s)]
*  He's innocent but a foreign terrorist and there's no way we can get him back. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=487.94s)]
*  All right, that is it for today's show, the main show at least. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=493.62s)]
*  But we've got a lot more to get to that we unfortunately didn't get to in [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lG1pOLbkfk&t=496.26s)]
