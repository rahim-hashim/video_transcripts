The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

*  Okay, you can't address a problem [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=49.36s)]
*  unless you're honest about a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=51.6s)]
*  problem. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=53.6s)]

*  Never should have happened. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=58.6s)]

*  Who cares? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=74.76s)]
*  If you don't win a damn election, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=75.56s)]

*  are. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=82.92s)]
*  And till Democrats learn that, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=84.16s)]
*  and quit keeping their head in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=87.32s)]
*  the cloud and talking goofy [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=89.16s)]
*  language and no one else talks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=90.92s)]
*  We gotta be nice to people, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=93.32s)]
*  screwed out, run over them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=95.2s)]
*  For those as ignorant about [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=98.2s)]
*  football as I am, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=99.72s)]
*  seventh string quarterback is bad. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=100.64s)]
*  Cenk. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=102.88s)]
*  Yes, that would be the seventh [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=103.4s)]
*  person that you would put in if all [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=105.68s)]
*  other six are out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=108.28s)]
*  So, look, I'm beginning to love [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=109.88s)]
*  James Carvel. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=112.56s)]
*  So historically, we've been on [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=114.88s)]
*  slightly different sides of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=116.32s)]
*  the political spectrum within [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=117.64s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  He has been more on the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  establishment side. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  I've been more on the populist [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=122.32s)]
*  side. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  But one thing I've always respected [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  about James Carvel and definitely [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=126.32s)]
*  throughout this election was that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  he doesn't pull any punches and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=129.88s)]
*  he loves to win. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=131.56s)]
*  He's obsessed with winning. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  Great, wonderful. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=134.88s)]
*  We need people who are obsessed [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  with winning on our side. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=137.84s)]
*  because if you don't win [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  the election, then you don't get to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  do policy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=141.44s)]
*  The only thing that matters is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=142.32s)]
*  policy, because that affects [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=143.6s)]
*  your life. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=144.96s)]
*  Everything else is just ego games, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=145.52s)]
*  okay? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=147.12s)]
*  So and he's speaking truth to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=147.62s)]
*  power here. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=149.04s)]
*  Now remember, now if you're on [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=149.68s)]
*  the establishment side as Carvel [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=151.48s)]
*  has been for a long time, normally [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=153.6s)]
*  you protect your sacred cows, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=155.8s)]
*  Joe Biden, Kamala Harris. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=157.72s)]
*  And he's done with that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=159.56s)]
*  And that's why I say I'm beginning [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=161.52s)]
*  to love James Carvel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=162.84s)]
*  So calling Kamala Harris [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=164.04s)]
*  seventh string quarterback, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=165.46s)]
*  I've never seen that ever, ever. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=167.16s)]
*  Normally after an election, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=169.16s)]
*  they're like, no, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=170.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris ran a perfect [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=171.16s)]
*  campaign. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=172.24s)]
*  They did do that on MSNBC, okay? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=172.76s)]
*  Flawless, flawless. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=174.84s)]
*  Flawless campaign. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=175.92s)]
*  How do you run a flawless campaign [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  and lose? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=178.16s)]
*  Anyway, so he's not pulling any [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=178.56s)]
*  punches when it comes to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=180.64s)]
*  establishment candidates. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=182.16s)]
*  And that is kind of revolutionary. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=184.44s)]
*  He's saying go populist. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=186.04s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know if he believes [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=187.56s)]
*  it, but that's huge. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=188.84s)]
*  Don't step on his line. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  Okay, all right, so I'll get to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=191.2s)]
*  it, we'll get to it in a second. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=192.32s)]
*  Then, I mean, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  he took Biden's head off there. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=194.16s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=195.56s)]
*  And this is not Johnny Come [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=196.2s)]
*  Lately, because he was one of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=197.56s)]
*  the rare guys who's trying to push [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  Biden out when we all started [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  trying to push Biden out. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  He came a little bit after [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=204.84s)]
*  Young Turks, but I'll take it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=205.88s)]
*  And he was one of the early ones. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=207.28s)]
*  And it's important for [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  guys that are respected in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  the establishment. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  They're like, Young Turks, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  they're outsiders. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=215.0s)]
*  Bernie people, right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  But for when Carvel says it, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=217.72s)]
*  they're like, wait, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=218.88s)]
*  Carvel won a national election. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=219.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=221.0s)]
*  Look, they're still inviting him to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=222.44s)]
*  be part of these discussions and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  these debates. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=226.0s)]
*  And he's still out there saying [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=227.04s)]
*  what he wants to say. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  But my experience has been, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=230.6s)]
*  Democratic Party doesn't take [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=232.6s)]
*  kindly to critics and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=235.24s)]
*  typically pushes them out. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=237.08s)]
*  So I don't know if they still [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=240.0s)]
*  respect him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=241.04s)]
*  See, no, here's the thing, Ana. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=241.6s)]
*  There's now, not just that there is [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=243.48s)]
*  no one leader, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=245.76s)]
*  which everybody's lamenting. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=246.76s)]
*  I'm ecstatic. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=248.96s)]
*  I don't want an anointed leader who [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=250.0s)]
*  comes in and pushes people like [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=252.4s)]
*  Carvel out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=254.4s)]
*  But not only do they not have [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=255.72s)]
*  a leader anymore, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=257.12s)]
*  because Kamala Harris is doing [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=258.12s)]
*  worst salads at home. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=259.8s)]
*  Biden has dementia. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=261.0s)]
*  There's nobody in charge. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  Jeffrey's is super weak. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=265.0s)]
*  Chuck Schumer's 98 years old. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  So I like that they are actually [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=268.35999999999996s)]
*  missing the entire leadership. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=270.4s)]
*  Because then there's no one to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  cancel people like Carvel, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=275.2s)]
*  There's no one to say, hey, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=278.0s)]
*  I'm going to push out everyone who [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  disagrees, I'm going to anoint, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=281.44s)]
*  etc. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  So, and in that vacuum, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=284.36s)]
*  we can push folks to pick [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=286.4s)]
*  a populist leader instead of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=288.36s)]
*  the same old establishment leaders. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=290.72s)]
*  So that's why I like that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=294.08s)]
*  So I want to come back to the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=295.44s)]
*  nonsense words that he talked about [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=296.88s)]
*  in a second. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=298.72s)]
*  And then if you're on the left, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=299.6s)]
*  you might not like what I have to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=300.84s)]
*  say about that, but- [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=302.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=302.72s)]
*  But Ana, go ahead. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=303.24s)]
*  Well, okay, so he obviously has [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=303.8s)]
*  a lot of criticism for [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=305.52s)]
*  the Democratic Party, for [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=306.72s)]
*  Joe Biden, Kamala Harris. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=308.08s)]
*  But does James Carvel have any [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=309.8s)]
*  solutions? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=311.28s)]
*  Well, he did offer some up. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=312.28s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=313.52s)]
*  First of all, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=314.88s)]
*  she got Joe Biden's campaign. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  That's it, they just [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=318.56s)]
*  kicked out the keys. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=319.44s)]
*  They have the same managers, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=320.12s)]
*  same strategists, same headquarters, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  same artwork, same computer [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  system, same bathroom. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  That is not good. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=327.56s)]
*  You don't even have your own [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=329.64s)]
*  people. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=330.84s)]
*  Then you can't have lobbyists [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  running presidential campaigns. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  So they said we can't run on [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=338.08s)]
*  a minimum wage. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=339.52s)]
*  Minimum wage hadn't been raised [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  in 2009, it's 725. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=342.68s)]
*  We couldn't say we're going to do [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=345.28s)]
*  away with tax breaks for people [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  make over $400,000 and take that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=350.24s)]
*  money and help young people buy [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  a house or get an education or [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=355.52s)]
*  rent a house because we were all [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  conflicted. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  And people say you think you should [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=362.52s)]
*  move to the left, you think you [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=364.0s)]
*  should move to the right, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=365.08s)]
*  move to like giving people a raise. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=366.32s)]
*  What is that? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=368.28s)]
*  That's what people want. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=368.84s)]
*  Give them something. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=371.4s)]
*  We refuse to do that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=372.36s)]
*  We sit there and we tell people how [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=374.04s)]
*  good the economy is. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=376.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, you got these kids here [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=377.28s)]
*  paying $300,000 for an education. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=379.52s)]
*  And I got these in Washington tell [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=382.12s)]
*  me how good I have it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=384.76s)]
*  Stop allowing the lobbyists to run [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=389.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=391.08s)]
*  Yummy in my tummy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=392.2s)]
*  He continued on to call for [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=394.56s)]
*  Democrats to run on raising wages, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=396.76s)]
*  making healthcare affordable, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  promoting vocational schooling, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=402.24s)]
*  trade schools, and improving public [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=404.76s)]
*  transportation, which would require [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  ensuring that people are safe on [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=409.76s)]
*  public transportation as well, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  rather than identitarianism. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=414.32s)]
*  And he argued that Democrats need [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=416.72s)]
*  to stop speaking to people as if [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=418.76s)]
*  they're morally and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=420.6s)]
*  intellectually superior. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=421.92s)]
*  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=423.8s)]
*  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=425.6s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=427.08s)]
*  Okay, so there's a video that I'm [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=427.72s)]
*  going to get to on the culture war [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=429.52s)]
*  stuff because he elaborates on that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=431.44s)]
*  But go ahead, Cenk. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=432.84s)]
*  Yeah, so look, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=433.8s)]
*  I love everything he's saying. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=434.84s)]
*  So lobbyists running the campaign, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=436.44s)]
*  are you nuts? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=439.48s)]
*  Are you nuts? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=440.6s)]
*  So thank God for [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=442.92s)]
*  James Carville saying these things. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=443.92s)]
*  And what did we say when Kamala [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=446.36s)]
*  Harris took over the Biden team? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=447.88s)]
*  You remember, we said, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=449.84s)]
*  why is she keeping the Biden team? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=451.04s)]
*  The Biden team is an epic disaster. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=452.76s)]
*  It's a runaway freight train of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=455.2s)]
*  idiocy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=458.08s)]
*  And so change the team. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  So Garvel agrees. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=461.36s)]
*  It's amazing what happens when both [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=463.04s)]
*  us and Carvel want to win. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=464.92s)]
*  We come to the same conclusions, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  right? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=467.8s)]
*  And then my favorite, of course, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  was actually deliver, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=470.64s)]

*  This is important. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=503.44s)]

*  I mean, rule one for [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=514.08s)]
*  the Democrats is the culture war [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=515.08s)]

*  The Trump guys love a DEI fight. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=517.92s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=521.08s)]
*  Is what we don't have enough [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=522.16s)]
*  transsexuals in the Marine Corps. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=523.64s)]

*  the DEI stuff. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=527.32s)]

*  the right fight you're winning and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=530.12s)]

*  Cenk. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=535.32s)]
*  What did I say for [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=537.04s)]
*  two years straight, right? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=537.84s)]

*  Stop falling into their traps. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=540.84s)]
*  You must be right wing. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=542.96s)]
*  You must be a right winger. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=544.24s)]
*  Yeah, or those guys have won [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=545.44s)]
*  presidential elections as the top [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=547.4s)]
*  advisors to their candidates. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=550.0s)]
*  So maybe and by the way, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=552.8s)]
*  who's the other guy who kept saying [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  similar stuff before the election [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=556.4399999999999s)]

*  This was the wrong strategy was [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  David Axelrod, the other guy who [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=562.12s)]

*  election, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=565.7199999999999s)]
*  So this is nonsense. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  Stop falling for the bait of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  fighting on losing ground. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=571.12s)]
*  The most extreme ground there is [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=573.76s)]
*  and I've asked now the people that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=575.92s)]
*  love to do that on the far left. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  I've asked them 100 times, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=580.24s)]
*  if you do it again, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=581.92s)]
*  why do you think you'll get [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=583.0s)]
*  a different result? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=584.6s)]
*  Like how is doubling down on that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=586.92s)]
*  strategy going to help us when it [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=589.16s)]
*  got us annihilated this time? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=591.36s)]
*  And they say, no, no, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=593.4s)]
*  we're denying reality. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=594.68s)]
*  That's not why we lost. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=596.2s)]
*  Okay, what's your theory? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=598.4s)]
*  What's your theory on doubling down [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=602.28s)]
*  on deeply unpopular positions and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=604.32s)]
*  how that somehow magically leads [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=606.32s)]
*  to a win? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=608.2s)]
*  Okay, so lastly, if they weren't [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=609.48s)]
*  mad enough about that, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=611.28s)]
*  wait till we get a load of this. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=612.4399999999999s)]
*  Stop using words that only people [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=614.28s)]
*  in politics and academia use, okay? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=616.2s)]
*  So the famous example, we've been [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=619.04s)]
*  over it a million times Latinx. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=620.64s)]
*  No one believed that no Latino has [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=622.12s)]
*  ever said that in their entire [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=623.96s)]
*  lives and I came out against it [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=625.6s)]
*  instantly because I am a apparently [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=627.24s)]
*  unlike other people on the left, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=629.48s)]
*  I know Latinos. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=631.48s)]
*  And I've never seen anyone say [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=633.56s)]
*  Latinx, okay? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=635.24s)]
*  Have you ever been to East LA? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=636.52s)]
*  I mean, you guys sound so [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=638.24s)]
*  out of touch and elitist, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=639.64s)]
*  constantly looking down your nose [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=641.04s)]
*  of it, you're morally inferior to [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=642.96s)]
*  me because I say Latinx and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=645.08s)]
*  you say Latino and Latina. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=646.76s)]
*  You mean like every Latino and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  Latina in the country? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay, but I'll go further so [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=652.28s)]
*  you can get even angrier. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=654.52s)]
*  Cisgender, no non-political person [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=656.72s)]
*  says that. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=660.04s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=662.6s)]
*  Go to a barbecue in the middle of [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=664.2s)]

*  they'll look at you like. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=667.24s)]
*  Okay, you can say it, I get it, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=669.64s)]
*  I know what the word is. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=671.4s)]
*  We need to pour one out for [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=672.92s)]
*  Jenks mentions, RIP Jenks mentions. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=674.72s)]
*  Okay, yeah, God bless. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=678.0s)]
*  We can say, brother, no, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=679.8s)]
*  it's a free country, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=680.96s)]

*  voters by going and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=685.76s)]

*  Okay, go ahead, but do it, do it, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=689.04s)]
*  but you're smarter than them. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=691.36s)]
*  You know words, so they'll respect [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=693.6s)]

*  clip because despite everything [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=706.76s)]
*  that was just said in regard to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  the identitarianism, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=710.64s)]
*  taking the culture war bait and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=712.2s)]
*  how that hasn't worked out for [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=714.0s)]
*  the Democratic Party, during a [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=715.84s)]

*  the various contenders who wanted [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=720.08s)]

*  a question was asked about [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=724.72s)]
*  the past election, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=726.44s)]
*  the past election in which [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=727.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris lost, Donald Trump [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=729.32s)]
*  won the popular vote, swept [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=731.28s)]
*  the battleground states. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=732.8s)]
*  And the fact that that question was [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=734.24s)]
*  asked was interesting enough, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=736.32s)]
*  the reaction to the question was [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=738.08s)]
*  even more interesting, take a look. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=739.76s)]
*  I have a show of hands. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=741.72s)]
*  How many of you believe that racism [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=743.24s)]
*  and misogyny played a role in [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=745.64s)]
*  Vice President Harris's defeat? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=747.44s)]
*  Okay, so that's good, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=749.92s)]
*  you all pass. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=753.56s)]
*  So I think that the problem with [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=755.64s)]
*  that whole interaction isn't that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=759.64s)]
*  racism and misogyny didn't play [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=763.9599999999999s)]
*  a role at all, it probably played [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=768.12s)]
*  a little role, right? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=771.7199999999999s)]
*  But I think that the problem with [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=774.52s)]
*  the whole interaction is that it [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=777.24s)]
*  played a much bigger role in [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=779.52s)]
*  the reason why Kamala Harris lost. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=781.68s)]
*  So look, I get it, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=784.68s)]
*  it played some role. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=785.88s)]
*  As I said earlier in the show, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=787.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't mind them raising [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=789.2s)]
*  their hand, I hate the question. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=790.64s)]
*  because the question sets them up [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  for the entire Democratic Party [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=794.64s)]
*  looking like being sore losers and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=796.68s)]
*  blaming the voters. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=798.92s)]
*  And I think that's a good [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=800.36s)]
*  example of why the Democratic [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=801.84s)]
*  Party is so important. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=803.96s)]
*  And blaming the voters. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=805.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't our fault that we [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=807.32s)]
*  lost, it wasn't that we picked [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=808.96s)]
*  the seven string quarterback. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=810.36s)]
*  It wasn't that Biden's brain fell [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=811.88s)]
*  out and we all pretended he was [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=813.48s)]
*  young and dynamic. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=814.84s)]
*  It was the day racist and [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=815.76s)]
*  sexist voters. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=817.44s)]
*  So, hey, voters are going to win [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=818.84s)]
*  you over by yelling at you and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=820.9200000000001s)]
*  calling you names. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=822.9200000000001s)]
*  If you weren't so racist and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=824.12s)]
*  sexist, you would have voted for [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=825.8000000000001s)]
*  us, world's worst strategy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=827.8000000000001s)]
*  So anyone who does that is [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  basically saying, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=832.4s)]
*  I'd love to help Republicans win. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=833.64s)]
*  How can I help Trump win? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=835.68s)]
*  How can I help JD Vance win? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=836.9599999999999s)]
*  Republicans, I'm here to help. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=839.28s)]
*  I'm your far left enabler. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=841.0799999999999s)]
*  All you got to do is click that [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=865.92s)]
*  join button right underneath [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwONnRStbc&t=867.04s)]
