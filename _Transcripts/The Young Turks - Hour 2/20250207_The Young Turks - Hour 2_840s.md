The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# United Health TARGETS Doctor Who Spoke Out Against Them
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk)
*  United sent me a letter which I'm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=0.0s)]
*  going to share in its entirety here [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=2.0s)]
*  and they denied my patients [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=3.84s)]
*  overnight stay. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=5.24s)]
*  I'm not going to be silenced by [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=6.04s)]
*  threats when it comes to speaking [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=8.08s)]
*  out for my patients and for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=10.24s)]
*  my ability to take care of them and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=12.08s)]
*  for what's going on in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=14.24s)]
*  the healthcare system. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=15.8s)]
*  If I don't speak out, then I lose. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=17.52s)]
*  All right, so that was [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=22.32s)]
*  Dr. Elizabeth Potter and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=23.8s)]
*  about a month ago we covered her [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  story where she alleged that she [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  was called by United Healthcare in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  the middle of a surgery she was [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=31.959999999999997s)]
*  performing and they asked to ask [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=34.08s)]
*  if their patient who was receiving [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=36.28s)]
*  breast reconstruction surgery after [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=38.68s)]
*  cancer treatment needed to stay [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=41.48s)]
*  in the hospital overnight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=44.04s)]
*  Now United Health Group, which is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=46.8s)]
*  the parent of the United Healthcare [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Company has lawyered up and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=51.12s)]
*  they're demanding that Potter take [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  her videos down. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  But she's vowing to fight back [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=57.04s)]
*  before we get any further. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  Let's rewind a bit and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=60.36s)]
*  take a look at the video that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  started the entire saga. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  I just said two bilateral deeps and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  two bilateral tissue commanders for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=67.44s)]
*  patients and I've never had this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=69.8s)]
*  happen before but [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=72.0s)]
*  during the second deep I had [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=73.2s)]
*  a phone call into the operating [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=75.16s)]
*  room saying that United Healthcare [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=77.2s)]
*  wanted me to call them about one of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=79.48s)]
*  the patients who was having surgery [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=81.64s)]
*  today who was actually asleep [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=84.0s)]
*  having surgery and said I had to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=86.0s)]
*  call right now and the gentleman [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=88.2s)]
*  said he needed some information [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=90.56s)]
*  about her one hour diagnosis and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=92.84s)]
*  whether her inpatient state should [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  be justified. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  And I was like to understand that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  she's asleep right now and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=102.0s)]
*  she has breast cancer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  And the gentleman said actually I [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=105.04s)]
*  don't that's a different department [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  that would know that information. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=109.44s)]
*  Anyone who's been through something [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=113.68s)]
*  like this knows exactly what's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=115.76s)]
*  going on in the week since that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  post Dr. Potter has been sharing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=119.44s)]
*  other insane stories of how she [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=121.24s)]
*  fights with insurance companies at [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  her job. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=124.88s)]
*  Here's one example. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  We saw 31 patients primarily [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=126.96s)]
*  patients with breast cancer today. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=129.0s)]
*  Also had another conversation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=132.92s)]
*  about a different patient with [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=134.56s)]
*  United where they wanted us to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=136.4s)]
*  justify an inpatient stay for [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=138.28s)]
*  a patient who is going to be [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  having a deep flap where that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  patient really does need to stay [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=144.4s)]
*  So just letting you know the real [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=147.12s)]
*  story here, trying to practice [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=149.4s)]
*  medicine in 2025, navigating [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=151.64s)]
*  insurance is one of the most time [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=153.92s)]
*  consuming parts of my job as [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=156.4s)]
*  a microsurgeon and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=158.48s)]
*  that's saying something. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=159.84s)]
*  Micromanaging the microsurgeon. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=161.92s)]
*  So we mentioned earlier that there [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=164.68s)]
*  was a letter sent to her by [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=167.36s)]
*  the United group and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=169.4s)]
*  here's an excerpt of it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=171.12s)]
*  United healthcare never asked or [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=173.68s)]
*  expected you to step out of surgery [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=175.56s)]
*  to make a phone call and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  any suggestion that we did so [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=179.24s)]
*  is false. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=181.24s)]
*  On the morning of the surgery, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  your office incorrectly ordered an [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=185.68s)]
*  inpatient hospital stay when you [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  meant to order an outpatient [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=189.52s)]
*  observation stay. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=191.08s)]
*  And the subject of this regarding [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  your defamatory TikTok and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  Instagram videos about United [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=197.28s)]
*  healthcare. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=199.28s)]
*  I'm going to briefly note that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=200.28s)]
*  an observation stay technically [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  means that you're staying in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=204.32s)]
*  the hospital while doctors are [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=205.88s)]
*  assessing if you need further care. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=207.52s)]
*  And in other words, if you're on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=209.68s)]
*  an observational stay, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=211.32s)]
*  you're technically still an [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=212.64s)]
*  outpatient even though you're [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=214.16s)]
*  inside the hospital. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=215.72s)]
*  It's a little bit of clarification. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=217.16s)]
*  Anyway, the letter continues, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=219.4s)]
*  because of the erroneous [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=221.2s)]
*  notification of an inpatient stay, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=222.6s)]
*  United healthcare was mandated by [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=224.72s)]
*  law to provide a reasonable [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=226.6s)]
*  opportunity to discuss the patient's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=228.04s)]
*  treatment with you prior to issuing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=230.04s)]
*  a denial and to do so promptly. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  It's not being United healthcare [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=233.64s)]
*  ever asked or expected you to step [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=235.2s)]
*  out of surgery to return that call. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=236.84s)]
*  You conceded that your office [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=238.28s)]
*  inpatient notification was [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=239.48s)]
*  erroneous when you spoke with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=240.76s)]
*  United healthcare. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=242.12s)]
*  When our client informed you that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=243.2s)]

*  from personal experience. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=328.76000000000005s)]
*  If they're going to come after you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=330.6s)]

*  the word defamatory somewhere at [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=334.12s)]

*  again. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=337.76000000000005s)]

*  then you're going to go to war. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=340.68s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=343.0s)]
*  And so there's a lot here, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=344.44s)]
*  obviously United is the group whose [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=346.16s)]
*  CEO was slain by Luigi. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=349.08s)]
*  And all of this is a backdrop. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=350.84s)]
*  Does this take the focus and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=352.92s)]
*  put it in the right place, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=354.96s)]
*  the wrong place? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=356.88s)]
*  How do you feel about her [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=358.12s)]
*  essentially getting taken to court [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  for pointing out something that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=362.08s)]
*  a lot of us, I mean, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  seemingly being led to the process [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=365.52s)]
*  of getting taken to court. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=367.52s)]
*  For something that a lot of us are [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=369.36s)]
*  like, yeah, that sounds about par [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=370.96s)]
*  for the course. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  It's complicated because there's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=373.44s)]
*  so many different things that are [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=375.32s)]
*  wrong and it's so complicated. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=377.12s)]
*  And I think what's wrong with [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=378.72s)]
*  the healthcare insurance industry [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=380.32000000000005s)]
*  specifically that they're fighting [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=382.32000000000005s)]
*  against an entire public who is not [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=384.44000000000005s)]
*  falling for their, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=386.44000000000005s)]

*  They're not falling for what [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  they're typically usually tricking [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  people about, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=393.16s)]
*  They act like they're here to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  facilitate healthcare for [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=396.44000000000005s)]
*  the people. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=398.24s)]
*  And they assume, I think up until [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=399.20000000000005s)]
*  very recently that the people were [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  falling for it, that the people [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=403.12s)]
*  were like, yeah, things are a [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=405.16s)]
*  difficult with these health [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  insurance companies, but [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  we need them, they're a necessary [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  evil, not even really so evil. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  But then whenever Luigi Mangione [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=413.92s)]
*  actually did assassinate the CEO of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=416.04s)]
*  United Healthcare, they didn't get [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=418.32s)]
*  the response that they were [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=420.68s)]
*  expecting to get. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=422.36s)]
*  I don't think they thought that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=423.56s)]
*  people would take the polite [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  response and just say, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=426.56s)]
*  we don't really like these [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  healthcare companies, but [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=429.32000000000005s)]
*  that's not what we should be doing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=430.68s)]
*  That's not who we are. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  There are other ways to get your [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=433.56s)]
*  message across, so let's not be, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  we're killing CEOs. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=436.8s)]
*  But that wasn't the response they [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=438.32s)]
*  got at all, right? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=439.84s)]
*  The response was either people [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=440.52s)]
*  were shrugging because they did not [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=442.12s)]
*  care that this man was shot in cold [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=443.96s)]
*  blood in the middle of the street [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=445.68s)]
*  in New York, or they were like, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=447.48s)]
*  maybe it's not such a bad thing, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=449.28s)]
*  right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=451.28s)]
*  So the response to all that maybe [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=452.2s)]
*  was a wake up call for them. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=454.0s)]
*  I would hope that it was a wake up [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=456.0s)]
*  call for them, regardless of what [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=457.64s)]
*  they said about it publicly or [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=459.44s)]
*  even in their own leaked internal [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=460.96s)]
*  memos. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=462.84s)]
*  But the thing with it is, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=464.12s)]
*  I don't know a single doctor who [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  became a doctor because they wanted [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=467.64s)]
*  to deal with all the bureaucracy, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=469.64s)]
*  because they wanted to do paperwork [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=471.56s)]
*  or because they wanted to just [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=473.4s)]
*  fight with insurance companies all [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=474.79999999999995s)]
*  day long. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=476.56s)]
*  They became doctors, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=477.08s)]
*  some for the money, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=477.91999999999996s)]

*  But most of them became doctors [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=479.96s)]
*  because they wanted to help people. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=481.24s)]

*  preventing doctors from doing their [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=484.59999999999997s)]
*  actual jobs, which is to help [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=486.35999999999996s)]
*  people. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=487.88s)]

*  So many people don't even have [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  access to health care, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=507.08000000000004s)]
*  either because they live in an area [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=508.44s)]
*  where they can't get access to it or [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  because they can't afford it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=512.36s)]
*  So we have other problems with [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=513.96s)]
*  health care already in this country [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=515.4s)]
*  that are preventing doctors from [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=517.16s)]
*  doing their absolute best. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  And if you want to talk about [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=520.16s)]
*  efficiency, Elon Musk, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=521.6s)]
*  this is a very inefficient system [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  because it hurts because people [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=524.8s)]
*  suffer directly because of it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=526.52s)]
*  People die because of it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=528.0s)]
*  So I really hope that this doctor [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=529.56s)]
*  is successful in her bid against [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=531.52s)]
*  the insurance companies, but [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=533.4799999999999s)]
*  she's going to need a lot of [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=535.3199999999999s)]
*  support if she's going to actually [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  realistically take them on and [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  take them down in any kind of way. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=540.68s)]
*  Maybe she needs Jesus. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=543.0s)]
*  Listen, this doctor, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=544.24s)]
*  you know what she should do? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=545.12s)]
*  We just talked about a story about [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=546.12s)]
*  how Christians are being [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=547.4799999999999s)]
*  discriminated against and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=548.4s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to do something [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=549.3599999999999s)]
*  about it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=550.68s)]
*  Say you're a Christian. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=551.24s)]
*  This doctor will say, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=552.16s)]
*  I'm a Christian, I'm being [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=552.92s)]
*  discriminated against from [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=554.04s)]
*  UnitedHealthcare. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=555.16s)]
*  Please, I'm a good God fearing [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=555.96s)]
*  Christian and now they're coming [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=557.64s)]
*  from me. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=559.44s)]
*  By the way, that's the level of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=560.0s)]
*  emptiness that they have in these [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=561.84s)]
*  types of accusations. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=563.8s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=565.56s)]
*  To your point, yes, people have [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=567.2s)]
*  stopped buying into this. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=569.44s)]
*  They still thought that we haven't [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=572.16s)]
*  reached that breaking point yet. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=573.92s)]
*  So of course, when that United [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=575.44s)]
*  Healthcare CEO was murdered, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=577.0s)]
*  there was the thought that people [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=578.64s)]
*  are going to fall into line like [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=580.32s)]
*  we always have. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=581.76s)]
*  Now they have to reconfigure [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=582.64s)]
*  Now this approach turns into trying [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=584.5999999999999s)]
*  to censor people coming for [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=586.1999999999999s)]
*  their social media posts. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  Again, stop and think about it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=589.04s)]
*  This is how normalization happens. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=590.64s)]
*  We just see something happen that [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=592.76s)]
*  we've always railed against, that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=594.16s)]
*  even this particular MAGA party is [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=595.68s)]
*  railed against. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=597.4s)]
*  And we see it as what's okay, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=598.64s)]
*  because the guy that I'm following [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=600.16s)]
*  is okay with this happening. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=601.88s)]
*  He hasn't mentioned anything to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=603.5999999999999s)]
*  that yet. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  It's authoritarianism. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=605.7199999999999s)]
*  That's a hateful approach to the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  way that we're supposed to, I [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=609.28s)]
*  thought, care about Americans. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=610.9599999999999s)]
*  I keep hearing these words, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=613.0s)]
*  America first, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=614.0400000000001s)]
*  make America great again, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  while someone is dying on [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=616.12s)]
*  an operating table. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=617.44s)]
*  Are they not an American? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  Maybe that person's a Christian, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=621.0s)]
*  but pile it all on top. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  But again, back to the social media [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=624.08s)]
*  posts, they're censoring people [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  posting about their experiences [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=627.36s)]
*  because they don't like what [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=628.96s)]
*  they're saying. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=630.32s)]
*  I thought Elon Musk paid hundreds [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=631.64s)]
*  of millions of dollars to buy this [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=633.2s)]
*  election, and also hundreds of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=634.72s)]
*  millions of dollars to buy Twitter, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=636.24s)]
*  so they can open up social media to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=637.96s)]
*  real life experiences, so [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  the people are no longer being [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=641.64s)]
*  held down by these bloodthirsty [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=643.16s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=644.72s)]
*  It's exactly what they're doing. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  So again, use the words they say, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  use the things that they say they [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=649.0799999999999s)]
*  are going to implement, which I'm [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=650.56s)]
*  not even sure they will, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=652.12s)]
*  use it to your advantage. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=653.36s)]
*  Start using the exact same words [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=654.56s)]
*  they use, because it's pretty [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=656.28s)]
*  obvious that their actions are in [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=657.88s)]
*  exact opposition to the things that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=659.6s)]
*  they say they're about. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of straightforward, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  but I mean, that's more for [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  just a show, because they're not [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=666.68s)]
*  going to buy it, because they [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=668.16s)]
*  really don't give a damn. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=669.4s)]
*  But in this particular situation, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=670.8s)]
*  these types of empty promises they [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=672.56s)]
*  push have to finally be highlighted. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=674.36s)]
*  I've always been a believer in, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=676.4399999999999s)]
*  you can tell people stuff, and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=677.92s)]
*  they don't have to necessarily [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  believe you, but once you show it [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=680.68s)]
*  to them, and then they're the ones [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=682.2s)]
*  that have to deal with it, they [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=683.8s)]
*  have to actually do something [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=685.28s)]
*  different about it. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=686.88s)]
*  I'm not sure how far this [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=688.12s)]
*  particular doctor can go with that, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=689.36s)]
*  but play the game, because the game [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=691.28s)]
*  has become their standard, and [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=693.2s)]
*  we're supposed to sit here and [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=694.92s)]
*  get gas lit, we're not seeing what [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=696.52s)]
*  we're seeing. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=698.4s)]
*  I don't know the specifics of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=699.2s)]
*  overnight stays and all that stuff [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=700.48s)]
*  as it pertains to this particular [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=701.9200000000001s)]
*  micro surgery. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=703.32s)]
*  Who cares, right? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=703.96s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  What if they didn't? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=705.5400000000001s)]
*  My point is, are you going to sue [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=706.9200000000001s)]
*  her? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=709.1600000000001s)]
*  Are you going to sue her? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=709.6600000000001s)]
*  If you are going to sue her, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=711.5600000000001s)]
*  the thing we hate about the [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=713.76s)]
*  insurance industry is these kinds [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  of cocksure posturings that they [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=719.0400000000001s)]
*  pull all the time while people are [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=722.0400000000001s)]
*  going through the worst experiences [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=724.9200000000001s)]
*  of their lives and deaths. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=728.16s)]
*  And you're going to say, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=732.52s)]
*  well, because we can, we're going [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=734.28s)]
*  to sue the doctor for doing what? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=736.68s)]
*  Yes, maybe she's [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=739.56s)]
*  misrepresenting something. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4km-ErFo9Xk&t=740.48s)]
