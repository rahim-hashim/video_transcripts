"Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) has drafted a constitutional amendment that, if ratified, would allow President Donald Trump to run for a third term. However, the measure is worded to prevent former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton from returning to the Oval Office.

The 22nd Amendment states, ‚ÄúNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.‚Äù*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Republicans Trying To Change The Rules To Allow Trump Third Term
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims)
*  The new reporting now about President-elect Trump's meeting with House Republicans happening [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=0.0s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=4.86s)]
*  He apparently told them, quote, I suspect I won't be running again unless you say he's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=5.86s)]
*  so good, we've got to figure something else out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=11.94s)]
*  A simple question of constitutional interpretation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=14.74s)]
*  Is President-elect Trump eligible to run for another term as president in 2028? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=17.72s)]
*  No, Senator, not unless they change the Constitution. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=24.02s)]
*  Well, we all knew this was coming. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=29.540000000000003s)]
*  A House Republican has officially launched an effort to upend the 22nd Amendment and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=32.18s)]
*  allow Trump to run for a third term. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=37.46s)]
*  Cenk, they said they wouldn't do it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=39.94s)]
*  Are we surprised that they're doing it? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=41.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, no is the correct answer. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=44.06s)]
*  And of course, it's a disaster. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=52.1s)]
*  But I have a really interesting reaction from the right wing to tell you guys about in a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=53.78s)]
*  minute. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=57.86s)]
*  But first, let's find out about this terrible plan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=58.86s)]
*  Yeah, okay, so the 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951 and it states, no person shall be [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=61.14s)]
*  elected to the office of the president more than twice. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=68.34s)]
*  And no person who has held the office of president or acted as president for more than two years [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=71.78s)]
*  of a term to which some other person was elected president shall be elected to the office of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=77.38s)]
*  the president more than once, quite a mouthful. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=82.78s)]
*  However, Tennessee Republican Andy Ogles announced a proposal to revise the amendment. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=86.9s)]
*  The language of the proposed amendment states, no person shall be elected to the office of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=92.06s)]
*  the president more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=96.98s)]
*  elected in two consecutive terms. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=102.26s)]
*  And no person who has held the office of president or acted as president for more than two years [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=105.18s)]
*  of a term to which some other person was elected president shall be elected to the office of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=111.06s)]
*  the president more than twice. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=116.38s)]
*  So according to the language in the measure, the other living presidents who have served [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=118.5s)]
*  two consecutive terms would be disqualified from running again. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=122.82s)]
*  So this amendment would only benefit Donald Trump, who is the only second president since [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  Grover Cleveland to serve a second non-consecutive term. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=133.34s)]
*  So that means that Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton would all be barred [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  from being able to run for a third term. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=141.66s)]
*  JR, before we go on, it's all a mouthful, not to be aegis or anything like that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  But I thought the Republicans don't like old presidents. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=149.74s)]
*  Trump would be pushing 90 by the end of his third term. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=152.22s)]
*  And it's not like he's super healthy or super with it as a 78 year old. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=154.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think they really know the process of this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=159.54s)]
*  It's just a little bit of ass. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=162.34s)]
*  I mean, that's just the way it goes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=164.58s)]
*  We'll get to more details of that in a minute. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=165.5s)]
*  But this is the idea, nothing is standard when it comes to this president. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=167.14s)]
*  Nothing is normal, up is down, left is right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=171.78s)]
*  That's just the way that they approach these things. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=174.14s)]
*  There's no shame in pushing that type of stuff. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  There's no thinking about it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=178.38s)]
*  There's no thought that the people that you're supposed to be representing may [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=180.5s)]
*  hold you accountable for your cartoonish and clownish statements. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=184.1s)]
*  Going through all this process just to try and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=187.42s)]
*  change a part of the Constitution that you know can't be changed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=189.33999999999997s)]
*  Which again, I think you guys know we'll get to. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=192.94s)]
*  I got a lot more on Andy Ogle as soon as we get through what this guy is actually [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=195.1s)]
*  up to though. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=197.94s)]
*  All right, well, in a press release, Ogle stated this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=199.06s)]
*  He said, President Trump's decisive leadership stands in stark contrast to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=202.22s)]
*  the chaos, suffering and economic decline Americans have endured over [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=206.46s)]
*  the past four years. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=210.38s)]
*  He has proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  reversing our nation's decay and restoring America to greatness. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=216.18s)]
*  And he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  This amendment would allow President Trump to serve three terms, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=224.38s)]
*  ensuring that we can sustain the bold leadership our nation so [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=227.82s)]
*  desperately needs. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  Now it's a long shot that this amendment actually gets ratified. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=232.78s)]
*  This is from CNBC. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=236.22s)]
*  It says, for a resolution to amend the Constitution to be sent to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=237.42s)]
*  the archivist of the United States, it must receive a two-thirds majority vote [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=241.14s)]
*  in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=246.22s)]
*  If that is done, three-fourths of the states, 38 states, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=249.14s)]
*  must ratify the amendment for it to become a part of the Constitution. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  Despite Republicans holding an extremely narrow majority in the House and Senate, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=257.5s)]
*  it's unlikely that any Democrats, let alone the amount of Democrats that they would need, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=261.66s)]
*  would vote for Ogle's resolution. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=266.70000000000005s)]
*  Now there are technically ways that Trump could work around this 22nd amendment [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=268.70000000000005s)]
*  should Ogle's attempt fail and get a third term for himself. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=273.18s)]
*  One hypothetical could be if JD Vance or another Trump ally runs in 2028, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=276.62s)]
*  wins and has Trump as her VP and then resigns. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=282.38s)]
*  That such a scenario would never happen and it never has happened and it could be [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  bit of a legal nightmare. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=291.82s)]
*  And as we mentioned earlier, Trump would be 83 years old in 2029. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=293.42s)]
*  So all of this is probably moot anyway and a distraction to the real issues surrounding [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=298.14000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump. Cenk, something in the language stood out to me there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=302.86s)]
*  Ogle said that Trump has proven himself to be the only figure capable of leading the nation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  That only is very telling along with the fact that they essentially want this man to die in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  the White House. It's all very power grabbing. It's not subtle. It's kind of dictator speech and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=317.58000000000004s)]
*  fundamentally un-American. What do you think? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=323.26000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so disastrous idea and it's disastrous on two fronts. First of all, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  half the country's top concern about Donald Trump was that he wasn't gonna leave office [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=331.74s)]
*  and that he was gonna trample on the Constitution. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=336.3s)]
*  You guys heard me before the election say a thousand times after he lost the election [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=338.3s)]
*  last time, he said we should terminate the Constitution. I know the right wing has trouble [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  believing it. Then they look it up and they're like, boy, he really did say that. And he said [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=347.1s)]
*  it on true social and there's no way around it because he doesn't care about it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  But to be fair, in this case, this is not Trump proposing it. It's this representative Ogles who's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=355.34000000000003s)]
*  clearly trying to kiss his ass. And so he's basically saying, yes, we would love for a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=360.14s)]
*  uterine and then there's the pathetic part where he writes it so that Obama and Clinton, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=365.42s)]
*  etc. Can't run. So it's like just in case it was clear, I don't want you to be mistaken and think [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=369.66s)]
*  that I'm fair in any way, shape or form. And by the way, we're a little scared of Barack Obama, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  so we wouldn't want him to run again, okay? But only us, only us. We have to be unfair. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=380.22s)]
*  We have to be unconstitutional. Now, again, to be fair, he is at least proposing a constitutional [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=385.26s)]
*  amendment that is the right process. Don't worry, it has a 0% chance of passing because you need [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=389.90000000000003s)]
*  three quarters of the states. So that means they would need 13. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=394.86s)]
*  You only need 13 states to block it. There are way more than 13 blue states. There's no way the blue [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  states are gonna be like, yeah, you're right. None of the Democrats should be able to run for [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  a third term, but Trump should. But he's basically doing it to say, we're thugs and your top concern [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=410.46000000000004s)]
*  about us not wanting to leave and being dictatorial, you were right. And so I was very curious how [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=417.66s)]
*  the right wing would react to this. Now, this is anecdotal, of course, I acknowledge that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=424.78s)]
*  And I actually want you to see it for yourself. And I almost never do this. But we'll put a link [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=431.65999999999997s)]
*  in the description box of the YouTube video, Facebook video, etc., if you're watching this [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=436.94s)]
*  later. And I want you to go to my post on Exxon this. And I wrote a long post about why this is [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=441.73999999999995s)]
*  a terrible idea. And by the way, it makes the right wing look ridiculous. And it makes the left wing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=446.85999999999996s)]
*  go, see, we told you, right? And I wanted to see what the right wing reaction to it was. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=452.46s)]
*  And about a third at least, and things by the time you watch it, I don't know what the percentages [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=457.97999999999996s)]
*  will be, and I'm just eyeballing it. You make your own judgment call on it. Or like, well, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=463.9s)]
*  I mean, if it's Trump, not so bad, right? Or, well, I mean, we could amend it and, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=467.97999999999996s)]
*  well, that makes sense, etc. Maybe a third or a little ambivalent, but not really. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=472.38s)]
*  But it looks to me, again, maybe I'm biased, you guys judge for yourself, but at least [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=478.14s)]
*  half of the commenters, but it looks like more than half to me. We're like, no, you're right, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=485.26s)]
*  dumb idea, it makes us look bad. This is Ogle's idiot trying to kiss Trump's ass in all the dumb [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=489.74s)]
*  ways. And we didn't say to do this, and we don't want it, and we don't need it. And besides which, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=494.53999999999996s)]
*  it's not, guys, remember, they're not on the left, right? So they said, besides which, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=501.02s)]
*  JD Vance is gonna win anyway. And when Trump's gonna be old, we don't need him, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=505.1s)]
*  we need Vance, we need a movement, we need this, we need that. But overall, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=508.22s)]
*  they're not happy with Ogle's. I don't know that they represent everyone, of course, right? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=511.74s)]
*  But I know the left and the independents hate this, and they are very, very, very right to hate this. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=516.14s)]
*  It's a little encouraging that apparently some portion of Magna hates it. But Magna, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=524.46s)]
*  if you go in this direction, you're just gonna confirm all the fears of the left wing about what [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=528.46s)]
*  you really want. You don't really want any of the principles you talked about in the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=533.82s)]
*  Constitution, etc. You just want unlimited power. So up to you guys how you wanna be seen. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=536.7800000000001s)]
*  JR. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=542.1400000000001s)]
*  Nobody cares. This is the thing, they don't connect it to everything else that happens [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=542.5400000000001s)]
*  in this entire movement. Yes, they may be against this one thing. They may be against [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=545.58s)]
*  when Donald Trump sent his foot soldiers into the Capitol for that day. The next day, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=548.94s)]
*  they were for it again. Things change based off of who's gonna say it's gonna change next. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=552.7800000000001s)]
*  If Donald Trump says this is a great idea, suddenly that little 35% that was all about [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=557.74s)]
*  how upset they are. And Andy Ogles would be like, well, it's a great idea. Andy Ogles should be [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=562.38s)]
*  your running mate because he came up with this great idea. It changes based off whether or not [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=565.74s)]
*  the king says it should change. Let's keep it real. But Andy Ogles, maybe they were connected [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=569.58s)]
*  to the fact that these are the type of people that they continue to elect. I know it's on a [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=575.34s)]
*  more state level with Andy Ogles, I believe Tennessee. Andy Ogles is a fraud. Andy Ogles [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=579.58s)]
*  is up for an FBI investigation into a $320,000 campaign contribution that they investigated [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=585.02s)]
*  because dude didn't have $320,000 of his own money to loan to himself. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=591.26s)]
*  So he's being investigated. And he's hoping that as we've all seen since 2015, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=595.34s)]
*  when Donald Trump came into office, that if you bribe, if you rub his chin a little bit, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=600.14s)]
*  dude's gonna give you anything he wants. If you say, hey, I'll be your friend. Hey, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=604.7s)]
*  there's your ass, where can I kiss it? Suddenly, he's gonna do anything you want. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=608.3s)]
*  So Andy Ogles, who then is under this Office of Congressional Ethics investigation to that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=612.9399999999999s)]
*  $320,000 that he then amended and said it was only $20,000. Then they find out later that there [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=619.02s)]
*  was no $320,000 loan. We're trying to figure out where this money came from. He would like this [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=624.54s)]
*  investigation to go away. Similar to Matt Gaetz and how you went after the former Speaker of the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=629.5799999999999s)]
*  House, McCarthy, because he didn't make an investigation go away. He's trying in a different [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=635.18s)]
*  way to butter up Donald Trump to help him make this whole thing go away because they're a bunch [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=640.9399999999999s)]
*  of law breaking criminals. And yo, I've got a 34 time felon in the White House. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=646.86s)]
*  I'm sure he's all about letting people off the hook for law breaking tendencies. He just released [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=651.9s)]
*  a whole bunch of criminals out of prison for January 6th. Maybe he'll get me off the hook [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=657.42s)]
*  for this FBI investigation too. So he's buttering him up, hoping that he'll let this whole thing go [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=662.0600000000001s)]
*  away. Because on top of that, what else Andy Ogles did? This dude lied about his academic [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  credentials. He used a stillborn death of a child to raise $25,000 for a children's burial [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=674.3s)]
*  garden that was never built. Similar to other folks that Donald Trump surrounded himself with. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=680.9399999999999s)]
*  He said he was a trained economist, a nationally recognized expert in tax policy and healthcare, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=686.78s)]
*  lies. Also, he's a trained police officer, even an expert in international sex crimes. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=691.5799999999999s)]
*  He's an amazing person. But people like this get into power because they know that the folks that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=696.9399999999999s)]
*  they've appealed to don't give a damn about anything, no principles, no credentials. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=702.38s)]
*  All they gotta do is say, I'm MAGA, I'm Donald Trump's guy, let me in and they're in. They're [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=709.1s)]
*  a bunch of idiots. Yeah. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=714.78s)]
*  Yeah, I remember all that about Andy Ogles. I think I covered that on Rebel HQ and that was a [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=716.14s)]
*  while ago. And then he kind of drifted off. But it's true whenever you have these people in [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=720.38s)]
*  government and they're already so beholden to their investors and to their lobbyists and then to their [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=725.02s)]
*  own crimes. They have so many skeletons in their own closets that they don't wanna come out. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=730.3s)]
*  They don't wanna ever have to pay any kind of price for. Donald Trump is their guy, right? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=735.74s)]
*  We know that he loves to get people offered. He loves to, that didn't come out the right way. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=741.0999999999999s)]
*  But he loves to pardon people. He's already been doing a lot of that. And he loves to, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=747.18s)]
*  he doesn't like accountability for any kind of thing, right? And he loves the sucking up. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=752.6999999999999s)]
*  And so do it. I imagine we're gonna see a lot of this. We're only a few days into this presidency. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=756.94s)]
*  We're already seeing all kinds of crazy stuff come out. And I worry because it feels like it's all [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=763.74s)]
*  very distracting, right? There's stuff that's actually happening that is going to affect real [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=768.94s)]
*  people's lives. And instead, we have to talk about these things because they are relevant, right? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=773.82s)]
*  If a congressperson proposes a third term for a president, that is a big deal. That is a [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=779.1800000000001s)]
*  historic moment. And we have to talk about it even though it's such a, I almost said something [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=784.54s)]
*  I shouldn't say. It's such a lame story. It shouldn't go anywhere. We know what this is. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=790.6999999999999s)]
*  This is gonna be an exhausting four years if this is what we're having to deal with. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=796.54s)]
*  Yeah, so last couple things here. First of all, I love the facts in the history that JR brought [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=800.2199999999999s)]
*  about Ogles. And that goes to show you why he needs that distraction. So in a sense, it's like [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=805.42s)]
*  a personal thing for him as well. Whether it's good or bad for his movement, he cares a lot [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=811.2600000000001s)]
*  less than kissing Trump's ass and creating a distraction for his corruption. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=816.7800000000001s)]
*  So look, since this one is literally not possible because there's no way the blue states are gonna [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=821.2600000000001s)]
*  agree to this. And there's just too many blue states. So that means it's a message that he's [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=826.94s)]
*  sending and whoever agrees with him is sending. So let's think about if you're a right winger, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=832.94s)]
*  think about that message. The message is even though we know it's not possible, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=837.26s)]
*  we'd like to irritate you by saying that we might wanna go outside the constitution. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=841.1s)]
*  And we might want Trump to stay just like you were worried about. Ha ha, we annoyed you and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=846.14s)]
*  we annoyed the whole country with this message. Yeah, okay, maybe when you were outsiders and [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=852.14s)]
*  you weren't in power, that might have been an interesting strategy. But now you're in charge, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=857.98s)]
*  so you gotta grow up a little bit. Because if you keep going down this path, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=863.42s)]
*  you're gonna make the same mistake the Democrats made. We don't have to pass anything that's [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=867.8199999999999s)]
*  popular. We just have to play the silly little political games. And we just have to hate the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=871.5s)]
*  other side enough. Good luck with that strategy, cuz you'll just hand the White House right back [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=876.38s)]
*  to us. So I appreciate it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnFL538Iims&t=880.14s)]
