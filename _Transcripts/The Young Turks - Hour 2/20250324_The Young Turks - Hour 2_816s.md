TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Rep. Jasmine Crockett Reacts To Threats From Trump's AG Pam Bondi
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA)
*  This is domestic terrorism. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=0.0s)]
*  And Maria, now you have this [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=2.06s)]
*  Congresswoman Crockett, who is [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=3.96s)]
*  calling for attacks on Elon Musk on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  her birthday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=8.3s)]
*  Let's take him out on my birthday, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=9.42s)]
*  she says. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=11.64s)]
*  Yet she turns and says, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  I'm not calling for violence. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=14.06s)]
*  Well, she is an elected public [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  official, and so [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=17.86s)]
*  she needs to tread very carefully. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=19.14s)]
*  This woman has one note. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=22.72s)]
*  Attorney General Pambandi threatened [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett over [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=26.86s)]
*  her weekend over her calls for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=28.9s)]
*  peaceful protests against Elon Musk [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=30.639999999999997s)]
*  and Tesla. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=32.86s)]
*  So we're going to correct the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=34.1s)]
*  record because Pambandi is lying. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=36.16s)]
*  But first, Cenk, how do you feel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=38.54s)]
*  about this sitting attorney general [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=40.54s)]
*  coming after a Congresswoman for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=42.94s)]
*  simply criticizing Elon Musk [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=45.12s)]
*  calling for demonstrations? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=47.14s)]
*  Yeah, this is super dangerous. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=49.78s)]
*  So I have strong feelings on [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=51.82s)]
*  the arson attacks, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  we'll get to that in a second. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=54.86s)]
*  But I think that using that as [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=57.22s)]
*  an excuse to start labeling your [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=59.059999999999995s)]
*  political opponents as domestic [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  terrorists and she went even [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=63.1s)]
*  further over the top as we'll show [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=65.1s)]
*  you in a second is super dangerous. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=67.42s)]
*  And she said, first of all, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=69.9s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett, as we'll explain, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=72.3s)]
*  literally said in that statement [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=75.5s)]
*  that she was not calling for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=77.86s)]
*  violence and just talking about [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=79.82s)]
*  taking down Elon politically. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=81.98s)]
*  If you can't say that, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=84.1s)]
*  what can you say? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=85.94000000000001s)]
*  All right, let's discuss. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=87.58000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I thought their side [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=88.74000000000001s)]
*  was interested in what did Trump [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=90.94000000000001s)]
*  used to say at the rallies? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=92.9s)]
*  Beat the hell out of them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=94.94000000000001s)]
*  She didn't say anything like that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=96.30000000000001s)]
*  Just, hey, this guy's not elected, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  he's gotta go. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=101.22s)]
*  But in that interview, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=103.14000000000001s)]
*  Bondi was perpetuating the right [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=104.26s)]
*  wing lie that Jasmine Crockett was [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=105.94000000000001s)]
*  telling Americans to blow up [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  Teslas, as Fox's Brian Kilmeade [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  falsely claimed last week. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=110.98s)]
*  What actually happened is that she [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=113.5s)]
*  participated in the hashtag [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=116.26s)]
*  Tesla takedown mass mobilizing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=118.56s)]
*  call which was devoted to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=121.02s)]
*  mobilizing nonviolent protests [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=122.76s)]
*  against Musk and Tesla on March 29. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=125.18s)]
*  Now according to their webpage, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=128.02s)]
*  Tesla takedown is a peaceful [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=130.18s)]
*  protest movement. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=132.02s)]
*  We oppose violence, vandalism, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=133.46s)]
*  destruction of property. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=135.62s)]
*  This protest is a lawful exercise [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=137.18s)]
*  of our First Amendment right to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=139.22s)]
*  peacefully assemble, okay? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=141.06s)]
*  There it is, pretty clear, but [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=143.9s)]
*  an out of context clip of her saying [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=145.98s)]
*  Elon Musk should be quote taken [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=148.22s)]
*  down, that was spread all over [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=150.34s)]
*  right wing media. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=152.34s)]
*  So Representative Crockett made sure [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=154.5s)]
*  to correct the record herself, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=156.1s)]
*  listen. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=157.38s)]
*  Just in case the slow people [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=157.9s)]
*  listening decide to clip this up [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=159.74s)]
*  later, I just want to say that I [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=161.94s)]
*  have never promoted violence [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=164.18s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=166.22s)]
*  Yet, I've also never made excuse [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=167.14s)]
*  for those violent actors such as [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=169.5s)]
*  the ones on January 6. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=171.82s)]
*  So Pam Bondi, if you have an issue [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=173.7s)]
*  with terrorism, maybe you should [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=176.14s)]
*  talk to your boss about locking [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=178.66s)]
*  back up those guys that he led out [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=180.94s)]
*  that participated in January 6. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=183.22s)]
*  I feel like this kind of deliberate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=185.62s)]
*  misrepresentation is about more [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=188.06s)]
*  than just rallying the base. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  It's about keeping honest dialogue [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=192.94s)]
*  from even happening. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=195.7s)]
*  You're so busy having to defend [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=197.54s)]
*  yourself to clarify right down [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=199.62s)]
*  to the word, the syllable, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=201.74s)]
*  that you don't ever get to just [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  honest dialogue. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=206.46s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=208.94s)]
*  this is massively dishonest. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=210.18s)]
*  So in that original statement, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=212.38s)]
*  she said she wanted to take down, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=215.18s)]
*  not take out Elon Musk as Pam Bondi [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=218.02s)]
*  said, take down Elon Musk. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=220.9s)]
*  And she even said right afterwards, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=223.9s)]
*  this is not about violence, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=226.26000000000002s)]
*  don't get, I mean, she couldn't be [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  clearer, definitely not physical. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=230.62s)]
*  This is a political statement. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=233.86s)]
*  She didn't even have to bother [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=235.94s)]
*  saying that, within this context, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=237.34s)]
*  it was obvious, but [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=239.06s)]
*  she said it anyway, and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  it didn't matter. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=241.46s)]
*  Look, did every right winger who [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=242.82s)]
*  saw the out of context clip and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=245.34s)]
*  did not see the later part of it, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=247.62s)]
*  know and they're just purposely [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  trying to smear her, the voters? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  No, do some of them know and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=254.9s)]
*  they're trying to smear her anyway? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=256.18s)]
*  Yes, but to me, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  the more important part is right [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=258.98s)]
*  wing media in this case and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=261.02s)]
*  the right wing politicians. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=262.66s)]
*  They know she said that it wasn't [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=264.58s)]

*  Listen, this is a serious thing, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=551.26s)]
*  okay? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=553.7s)]
*  People who are coming together to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=554.26s)]

*  And it prevents, again, honest [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=569.5s)]

*  What say you, Cenk? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=576.34s)]
*  Yeah, so attacking the Teslas is so [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=577.5s)]
*  monumentally dumb because it's so [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=580.02s)]
*  counterproductive that in the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=582.58s)]
*  beginning I was like, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=584.78s)]
*  is this a false flag operation? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=586.28s)]
*  Because if you wanted the right [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=588.38s)]
*  wing to seize more power, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=590.38s)]
*  what you would do is burn a couple [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=591.94s)]
*  of Teslas so they can call you [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=594.02s)]
*  terrorists and then pretend [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=595.94s)]
*  everyone on the left is a terrorist [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=597.78s)]
*  and then start locking up [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=599.86s)]
*  Democratic politicians like [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=601.3s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=603.06s)]
*  You just couldn't be any more [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=604.22s)]
*  counterproductive than this. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=605.9s)]
*  And then when you attack random [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=608.22s)]
*  Teslas, put Swastikas on them or [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=609.82s)]
*  whatever, guys, remember before we [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=611.66s)]
*  knew what Elon was about, tons and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=613.86s)]
*  tons of progressives and left [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=615.9s)]
*  wingers and Democrats bought [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=617.58s)]
*  Teslas. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=619.22s)]
*  So you don't know who you're [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=619.74s)]
*  attacking. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=621.9s)]
*  Here's a crazy idea, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=622.9s)]
*  don't attack anyone. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=624.58s)]
*  So do not give them cause to take [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=626.9s)]
*  away more rights. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=629.9s)]
*  And it's just so dumb, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=631.98s)]
*  not only that, it's just not [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=634.46s)]
*  the right thing to do. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=636.98s)]
*  When you fight back politically, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=639.1s)]
*  rhetorically and you win in [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=641.06s)]
*  the battle of ideas, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=642.46s)]
*  you're not going to outviolence [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=643.66s)]
*  them, it's immoral, it's stupid, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=645.58s)]
*  it's counterproductive, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=647.74s)]
*  I can't stand it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=649.38s)]
*  So okay, now as I tell you, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=650.62s)]
*  we're fair to both sides. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=652.14s)]
*  I told you January 6 guys don't [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=654.02s)]
*  represent all the right wingers, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=655.74s)]
*  okay, but there was a lot of them. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=657.66s)]
*  In this case, there's two or [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=659.54s)]
*  three people who've done this. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=660.78s)]
*  Do they represent the whole left? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=662.14s)]
*  Forget the whole left, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=664.0600000000001s)]
*  that's absurd, utterly absurd. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=665.1s)]
*  Do they even represent the whole [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=666.7s)]
*  far left? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=668.7s)]
*  No, of course not, of course not. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=669.3000000000001s)]
*  They represent themselves or [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=672.1800000000001s)]
*  jackasses. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=673.62s)]
*  And if you're going to get 20 years [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=674.82s)]
*  in prison for arson and violence and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=676.4200000000001s)]
*  all this stuff, why do you need to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=678.0600000000001s)]
*  add terrorism charges? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=679.62s)]
*  So now let's turn to that. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=681.1s)]
*  So now we're calling people [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=684.4200000000001s)]
*  domestic terrorists. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=685.74s)]
*  By the way, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=687.02s)]

*  church, kills black people on [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=693.22s)]
*  purpose, writes, I did this for [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=694.98s)]
*  political ideology, not a terrorist. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=696.6600000000001s)]
*  Somebody goes into the Tides [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=698.94s)]
*  Foundation, which is George Soros's [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=700.34s)]
*  group, tries to kill everyone [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=702.14s)]
*  there, not a terrorist. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=703.62s)]
*  You burn a car, a terrorist. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=705.4200000000001s)]
*  You try to kill people, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  not a terrorist. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=707.9s)]
*  The guy who sent pipe bombs to all [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=708.4200000000001s)]
*  of Donald Trump's political [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=710.5400000000001s)]
*  opponents, not a terrorist. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=712.38s)]
*  You burn cars, you're a terrorist. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=714.86s)]
*  No, we should just get rid of [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=716.74s)]
*  the word terrorist. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=718.7s)]
*  First of all, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=720.9s)]
*  it doesn't mean anything. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=721.5s)]
*  It's never, ever applied evenly. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=722.74s)]
*  Hamas kills innocent civilians, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=726.66s)]
*  terrorist. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=728.58s)]
*  Israel kills 50 times the number of [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=729.54s)]
*  innocent civilians, obviously does [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=732.78s)]
*  it on purpose, nearly destroyed [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=736.0600000000001s)]
*  every building in Gaza, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=738.38s)]
*  blowing up hospitals on purpose. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=740.0600000000001s)]
*  Nope, not a terrorist. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=742.26s)]
*  It's the dumbest word. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=743.9s)]
*  And once you start using it inside [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=745.7s)]
*  the country, we're going to be at [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=747.34s)]
*  each other's throats. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=748.94s)]
*  And we're going to take both sides [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=750.46s)]
*  of the country, we're going to [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=751.62s)]
*  start taking political prisoners. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=752.4200000000001s)]
*  It's an absolute train wreck. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=753.5s)]
*  And then finally, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=756.5400000000001s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=757.58s)]
*  Look, the neocons are back, right? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=759.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we'll put together [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=761.38s)]
*  all the stories. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=762.22s)]
*  Now you oppose Israel, you're [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=763.0600000000001s)]
*  getting arrested and deported. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=764.5400000000001s)]
*  And they're starting to call [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=766.7s)]
*  people who they don't agree with [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=768.0200000000001s)]
*  inside the country, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=769.5400000000001s)]
*  domestic terrorists. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=770.46s)]
*  And now we're talking about weapons [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=771.7s)]
*  of mass destruction again. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=773.3000000000001s)]
*  So no, a Molotov cocktail is [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=774.9000000000001s)]
*  a very dangerous thing. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=776.62s)]
*  And a person who throws it should [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=778.6600000000001s)]
*  only be arrested and prosecuted [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=780.18s)]
*  the fullest extent of the law. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=781.86s)]
*  It is not a nuke. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=783.9399999999999s)]
*  It is not a weapon of [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=785.26s)]
*  mass destruction. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=786.22s)]
*  That kind of talk is insane. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=787.5s)]
*  So but the neocons are back. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=790.46s)]
*  Trump said he was going to be [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=792.38s)]
*  different. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=793.3s)]
*  This doesn't look any different [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=794.38s)]
*  than the same old Republican goons [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=796.38s)]
*  and the same old establishment and [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=798.86s)]
*  the same old neocons. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=800.66s)]
*  And now instead of invading Iraq, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=802.42s)]
*  they're invading us inside this [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=805.22s)]
*  country and [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nielPkLuuLA&t=806.8199999999999s)]
