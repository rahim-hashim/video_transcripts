TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Elon Musk BROKE by Question from Larry Kudlow
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ)
*  You're giving up your other stuff? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, how are you running [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=2.2s)]
*  your other businesses? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=3.64s)]
*  With great difficulty. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=6.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=7.42s)]
*  But there's no turning back, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=13.98s)]
*  you're saying? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=15.82s)]
*  I'm just here trying to make [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=16.94s)]
*  government more efficient. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=20.38s)]
*  I mean, we've all had those days [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=24.18s)]
*  when we've spent all day getting [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=25.86s)]
*  sucked into X, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=27.580000000000002s)]
*  Like you, for whatever reason, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  whatever reason you got sucked into [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=31.26s)]
*  some sort of conflict and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=33.22s)]
*  you can't take your eyes off of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=34.58s)]
*  the social media platform. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=36.14s)]
*  The problem with Elon Musk is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=38.0s)]
*  that's his everyday. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=39.52s)]
*  How does he have this much time to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=41.36s)]
*  post on X, Was? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=43.36s)]
*  How does he have this much time? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  I don't have time to post on X. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=47.28s)]
*  I go weak sometimes without posting [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  anything on X because I don't have [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=50.64s)]
*  the time. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=52.16s)]
*  How does the CEO of multiple [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=52.74s)]
*  companies, a guy who's the head of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=54.36s)]
*  a federal government agency, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=56.36s)]
*  have this much time to post on X? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=58.26s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, the guy's clearly addicted [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=62.62s)]
*  and he's on it at all times. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=65.5s)]
*  And I'm sure he's in group chats [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=68.42s)]
*  where people are sending him memes [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=70.86s)]
*  and sending, look at what this [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=73.46s)]
*  person said about Elon or posted [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=75.66s)]
*  about you or whatever. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=77.82s)]
*  So it's not even just that he's on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  it all the time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=81.06s)]
*  I'm sure he has these mechanisms [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=82.22s)]
*  that are feeding it to him to make [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=84.58s)]
*  sure that he is kept abreast of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=86.88s)]
*  the latest praise that he's getting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=89.16s)]
*  from his fawning cult members on [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=91.8s)]
*  the platform, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=94.24s)]
*  And the truth of the matter is if I [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=96.32s)]
*  was a freaking Tesla stockholder or [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  SpaceX or any of this other stuff, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=101.86s)]
*  I would be pissed right now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=104.82s)]
*  Well, we'll tell you why Was is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  correct in having that take because [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=110.28s)]
*  look, as a reminder, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=112.68s)]
*  Musk is the CEO of multiple [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=114.0s)]
*  companies, not just Tesla, but [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=115.82s)]
*  also he's the CEO of SpaceX and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=118.22s)]
*  CTO of X, he's not the CEO but [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=120.52s)]
*  CTO of X. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=122.84s)]
*  So today, we're going to focus on [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=123.74s)]
*  Tesla specifically because well, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=125.94s)]
*  take a look at this, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=128.3s)]
*  this chart will show you, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=129.7s)]
*  Tesla's not doing so well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=131.54s)]
*  The stock for Tesla has taken a dip [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=133.46s)]
*  to say the least about 30% over [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=136.66s)]
*  the last week, and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=139.78s)]
*  I'm sorry, this is a six month [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=141.84s)]
*  performance chart for Tesla stock. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=144.16s)]
*  And as you can see, it went up like [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=147.12s)]
*  crazy in the weeks after Trump got [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=149.72s)]
*  elected, peaking at almost $500 per [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=152.38s)]
*  share in mid December. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  But since then, it's been tumbling [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=157.0s)]
*  and tumbling and as of writing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  this, Tesla's stock sits at $225. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=161.88s)]
*  So this is a six month performance [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=164.72s)]
*  chart for Tesla stock and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=167.52s)]
*  it's peaking at $225 a share. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=169.46s)]
*  So that's still pretty pricey per [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  share, but it's not $500 per share, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=174.74s)]
*  obviously he's struggling here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=176.9s)]
*  So in fact, yesterday was the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=179.66s)]
*  single worst day for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=181.74s)]
*  Tesla stock in five years, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=182.96s)]
*  it went down a whole 15%. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=184.82s)]
*  That also by the way, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=186.78s)]
*  reduced Musk's net worth by $29 [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=189.14s)]
*  billion, that's how rich he is, so [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=192.66s)]
*  it's kind of incredible. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=196.3s)]
*  But what's behind the massive [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=198.96s)]
*  losses? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=200.74s)]
*  Well, there's at least one reason [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=201.28s)]
*  is as, so one reason is a large [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=203.64s)]
*  number of ongoing Tesla boycotts and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=205.64s)]
*  protests are taking place right now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=208.06s)]
*  Some of these, the boycotts are fine, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=210.52s)]
*  obviously you get to vote with your [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=213.8s)]
*  dollars, it's not a big deal. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=216.44s)]
*  There are also people who are [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=219.56s)]
*  vandalizing people's Teslas, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=220.96s)]
*  please don't do that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=222.56s)]
*  Please don't do that, there are a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=223.8s)]
*  lot of people out there who aren't- [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=225.64s)]
*  The money's already spent guys. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=227.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=229.7s)]
*  Elon already got the bread, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=230.7s)]
*  this is crazy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=232.22s)]
*  Exactly, exactly, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=233.1s)]
*  you're just victimizing normal [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=234.14s)]
*  Americans who might not even be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=235.74s)]
*  aware of what's going on in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=237.22s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=238.38s)]
*  Not everyone is super political or [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=239.66s)]
*  plugged in, but nonetheless. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=241.46s)]
*  So Bloomberg spoke to several Tesla [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=243.26s)]
*  owners who did sell their Tesla or [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=245.78s)]
*  do plan to sell their cars soon [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=248.28s)]
*  because of Musk's actions within [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=250.54s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=253.02s)]
*  So one was a man by the name of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=254.86s)]
*  Eric Thurber who stated, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=256.91999999999996s)]
*  I couldn't handle what Elon Musk [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=258.91999999999996s)]

*  I've been voting with my wallet [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=283.4s)]

*  Now look, typically I would say [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=287.26s)]
*  that boycotts don't work, but [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  obviously the Bud Light boycott [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=291.78s)]
*  worked when the right did it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=294.06s)]
*  So if this is actually a sustained [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=295.82s)]
*  organized effort, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=297.82s)]
*  it could really have an impact. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=298.96s)]
*  And clearly you look at the value [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=300.78s)]
*  of Tesla shares, and considering [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=303.06s)]

*  these boycotts are working. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=308.02s)]
*  So a self-described Tesla [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=310.18s)]

*  Nazi salutes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=320.52s)]
*  So he says, I didn't want to be [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  saddled with a vehicle that was [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=323.96s)]

*  When you own a vehicle like that, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=328.12s)]
*  you are advertising for that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=330.44s)]
*  company. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=332.4s)]
*  And finally, Trump has stated that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=333.32s)]
*  it is illegal to boycott Tesla, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=336.15999999999997s)]

*  unfortunately some of the anti-Tesla [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=350.0s)]

*  violence. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=354.46000000000004s)]

*  firings across several government [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=368.54s)]

*  vandalism involving gunfire on [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=395.64s)]

*  Lawful picketers are condemning [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=398.68s)]
*  and scamming any violence and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=400.62s)]
*  vandalism. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=402.5s)]
*  You have a right to protest. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=404.18s)]
*  We who served in the military said [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=405.94s)]
*  to give you that right, but [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=407.74s)]
*  not to up and destroy and shoot and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=409.26000000000005s)]
*  burn and whatever. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=411.1s)]
*  No, go protest. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  Stand up, scream and holler, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=414.38s)]
*  get your bullhorn out, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=415.6s)]
*  go do your thing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=416.66s)]
*  But no, no violence. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=417.70000000000005s)]
*  So was like with any demonstration, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=419.34000000000003s)]
*  any protest, you're always going to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=421.66s)]
*  have a handful of wreckers who [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=423.82000000000005s)]
*  engage in illegal acts, violence. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=425.54s)]
*  And that certainly happened in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=428.68s)]
*  some cases on college campuses when [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=430.56s)]
*  pro-Palestinian protests are [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=432.76s)]
*  happening. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=434.52s)]
*  Now the Trump administration is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=435.2s)]
*  squashing pro-Palestinian protests [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=436.84s)]
*  entirely. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=438.56s)]
*  You think that's going to happen in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=439.2s)]
*  this case with the Tesla protests? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  These are a little bit less [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=442.64s)]
*  organized, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=444.56s)]
*  In terms of like you can't organize [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=446.16s)]
*  a burning of a store. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=448.76s)]
*  So you can probably stop people [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=450.76s)]
*  from protesting, but [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=452.8s)]
*  you're not going to stop people [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=454.24s)]
*  protesting by some excessive show [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=456.34s)]
*  of force. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=458.98s)]
*  And I think folks need to understand [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=459.78s)]
*  that the Tesla stock price and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=462.46s)]
*  all of that stuff, folks got to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=464.74s)]
*  understand the nature of that stock [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=467.24s)]
*  price has always been overinflated. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  How do you become the richest man [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=473.38s)]
*  in the world by just selling cars? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  Toyota's not the richest company in [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=478.3s)]
*  the world. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=480.74s)]
*  They sell way more Teslas than Elon [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=481.46s)]
*  does. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=484.06s)]
*  That's because Elon's stock price [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=485.28s)]
*  is pegged to just people's belief [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=487.4s)]
*  that he's going to turn Tesla into [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=489.38s)]
*  more than just a car company, right? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=491.28s)]
*  It's going to be self-driving, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=493.4s)]
*  it's going to be this, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=495.15999999999997s)]
*  it's going to be self-taxing, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=496.36s)]
*  you're going to be able to [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=497.96s)]
*  rent your Teslas. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=499.12s)]
*  He's always selling some grander [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=500.04s)]
*  vision that usually doesn't come [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=502.03999999999996s)]
*  the fruition. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=504.08s)]
*  And that's what the stock price is [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=505.32s)]
*  indicative of. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=506.96s)]
*  That's not to say he didn't turn [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=507.92s)]
*  Tesla into a profitable company. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=509.52s)]
*  It is, but the profits made off of [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=511.28s)]
*  the cars that this guy sells, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=513.5799999999999s)]
*  that's not what that stock price [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=515.66s)]
*  is based off of. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=517.9s)]
*  So it is mostly just conjecture and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=519.06s)]
*  fluff, to be honest. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=521.4599999999999s)]
*  And I'm not surprised that this [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=523.0999999999999s)]
*  thing has sort of turned itself [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=525.5s)]
*  around because he's made himself [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  into a polarizing public figure. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=530.38s)]
*  And so when you're not selling your [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=532.9399999999999s)]
*  cars to every possible customer [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=535.3399999999999s)]

*  And when you have an over inflated [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=544.48s)]

*  The boycotts are certainly [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=555.72s)]
*  a disruption. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=556.9200000000001s)]
*  But it's not just happening in [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=557.76s)]

*  I want to be clear about that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=560.12s)]
*  So after, briefly, as we briefly [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=561.24s)]
*  mentioned in that clip, so [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=563.64s)]

*  much international. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=567.88s)]

*  Toyota. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=593.58s)]
*  Obviously Toyota doesn't sell [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=594.7s)]
*  Tesla's he misspoke, but [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=596.26s)]
*  obviously Toyota sells way more [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=597.66s)]
*  electric vehicles compared to Tesla [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=599.46s)]
*  because they're more affordable. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=601.62s)]
*  Now Trump has weighed in on these [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=604.4200000000001s)]

*  The one thing I do like about [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=948.1s)]
*  Tesla's is the pickup. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=950.02s)]
*  That thing does have some [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=951.9s)]
*  incredible acceleration. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=953.62s)]
*  You are just zooming through [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=955.78s)]
*  people, especially when you're [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=957.38s)]
*  merging on a highway or [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=959.1999999999999s)]

*  made and so it falls apart. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=966.3s)]
*  The wear and tear factor is [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=968.0s)]

*  Los Angeles where you have a lot of [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYg-KBCqjQ&t=979.5600000000001s)]
