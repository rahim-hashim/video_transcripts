"The Education Department announced on Tuesday that it was firing more than 1,300 workers, effectively gutting the agency that manages federal loans for college, tracks student achievement and enforces civil rights laws in schools.

The layoffs mean that the department, which started the year with 4,133 employees, will now have a work force of about half that size after less than two months with President Trump in office. In addition to the 1,315 workers who were fired on Tuesday, 572 employees accepted separation packages offered in recent weeks and 63 probationary workers were terminated last month."

# Trump's Dismantling of the Dept of Education Has Begun
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs)
*  We wanna cut people that aren't doing the job. We wanna keep the right people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=0.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=3.52s)]
*  And I said, I don't wanna just say we're gonna cut 50%. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=4.24s)]
*  I wanna cut the people that aren't doing the job. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Is this the first step on the road to a total shutdown? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=10.4s)]
*  Well, we're about to hear the answer from our newly confirmed Secretary of Education, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=13.84s)]
*  Linda McMahon. But before we do, it is important to know that the Education Department just sent out [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=21.36s)]
*  layoff notices to half of its workforce, which could mark the beginning of the end of the Federal [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=28.24s)]
*  Department of Education. Now, about 1,300 workers are getting fired from the department, but the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=35.04s)]
*  dismantling of the agency is actually worse when you dig into the numbers. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=43.12s)]
*  So they will remain on payroll for about 90 days and receive full pay and benefits during [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=48.16s)]
*  those 90 days, so they're getting severance. With that in mind though, the layoffs mean that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=54.32s)]
*  the department, which started this year with 4,133 employees, will now have a workforce of about [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=59.12s)]
*  half that size after less than two months with President Trump in office. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=67.12s)]
*  But there's more in addition to that. In addition to the 1,315 workers who were fired on Tuesday, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=72.08s)]
*  572 employees had accepted separation packages that were offered in recent weeks, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=79.92s)]
*  and 63 probationary workers were terminated last month. So obviously, more workers have either left [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=85.28s)]
*  or have been fired than the roughly 1,300 that just got those layoff notices. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=93.36s)]
*  Now, if you're wondering, well, what exactly is the Department of Education responsible for? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  They manage federal loans for colleges. They enforce civil rights laws in educational [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=103.52s)]
*  institutions across the country, and they also monitor student achievement in our public school [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=109.92s)]
*  system. So with all of that in mind, here is Linda McMahon, Education Secretary, answering [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=115.52s)]
*  whether the Education Department will cease to exist in the near future. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=121.68s)]
*  Is this the first step on the road to a total shutdown? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=125.2s)]
*  Yes, actually it is because that was the president's mandate. This directive to me [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=130.08s)]
*  clearly is to shut down the Department of Education, which we know [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=137.2s)]
*  will have to work with Congress to get that accomplished. But what we did today was to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=140.4s)]
*  take the first step of eliminating what I think is bureaucratic bloat. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=145.76s)]
*  And that's not to say that a lot of the folks, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=150.32s)]
*  it's a humanitarian thing to a lot of the folks that are there, they're out of a job. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=152.96s)]
*  But we wanted to make sure that we kept all of the right people, the good people, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=157.76s)]
*  to make sure that the outward facing programs, the grants, the appropriations that come from [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=162.8s)]
*  Congress, all of that are being met. And none of that's gonna fall through the cracks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=168.0s)]
*  So that was my next question. So the criteria for keeping that 50% [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=171.6s)]
*  is related to expenditures and key programs? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=177.2s)]
*  Correct. So notice that she mentioned the necessity of Congress in order to officially [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=181.36s)]
*  dismantle any government agency, really, especially if Congress created that agency [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  or passed legislation in order to have that agency exist within the federal government. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  It's good that she mentioned Congress because it means that she's at least acknowledging our [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  system of checks and balances and the need for Congress to officially dismantle the Department [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=207.44s)]
*  of Education. However, polls have consistently shown that roughly two-thirds of Americans [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=211.6s)]
*  are not in favor of shutting down the Department of Education. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=219.28s)]
*  So she might be saying it for that reason, I don't know. But the Trump administration [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  should proceed with caution because this could be yet another vulnerable area for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=227.36s)]
*  Donald Trump's approval rating and poll numbers. And as we've learned with the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=232.56s)]
*  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has not been officially dismantled through Congress, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=236.96s)]
*  it has effectively been dismantled by gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=243.52s)]
*  essentially firing all these people. And Trump is also considering moving [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=249.84s)]
*  student loan processing to the Treasury Department. Trump has also talked about moving some of the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=254.56s)]
*  agency's work with student loans to the Treasury Department. Education Department officials visited [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=260.08s)]
*  the Treasury Department on Monday to prepare for the shift, said one person familiar with the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=265.2s)]
*  planning. And in addition to that, in her confirmation hearing last month, Linda McMahon [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=270.88s)]
*  discussed moving civil rights enforcement to the Justice Department and services for disabled [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=278.32s)]
*  students to the Health and Human Services Department. And McMahon claims that the goal [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=284.0s)]
*  here is to make things more efficient, to solidify power and decision making with the states. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=289.44s)]
*  She says that none of this is going to negatively impact the processing of student loans, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=297.2s)]
*  Pell grants, funding for special needs students or competitive grant making. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=301.68s)]
*  However, President of the American Federation of Teachers, Randy Winegarden, thinks otherwise. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=306.48s)]
*  Think about a country whose president basically says, I'm getting rid of education. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=312.08s)]
*  What does that say about the future? So many people are so mad about it because they're just [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=320.8s)]
*  taking opportunity away from kids that don't have it. So billionaires, kids and billionaires, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=326.08s)]
*  they have it. Let's stay on the facts. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=331.28s)]
*  Sorry, I'm really angry about this. No, because this is what keeps me. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm really angry. Your reaction? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, clearly we're not taking away education. The president never said that. He's taken the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=338.8s)]
*  bureaucracy out of education so that more money flows to the states. Better education is closest [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=342.32s)]
*  to the kids with parents, with local superintendents, with local school boards. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=348.0s)]
*  I think we'll see our scores go up with our students when we can educate them [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=353.2s)]
*  with parental input as well. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=357.92s)]
*  So John, I wanna bring you in because she denies that the Trump administration is attempting to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=359.44s)]
*  dismantle educational opportunities for America's public school students. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=367.84s)]
*  And look, I also wanna be clear that in terms of what the department has more control over, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=372.24s)]
*  they do have a lot more control over higher education as opposed to public schools. The [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=378.24s)]
*  states already decide the funding mechanisms for their public schools and they have a little more [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=382.88s)]
*  control than the federal Department of Education does. But nonetheless, I mean, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=389.36s)]
*  most of these firings actually came from the office of civil rights within the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  Department of Education. And these are the people who are tasked with investigating and adjudicating [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  civil rights complaints that have occurred within these campuses. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=406.16s)]
*  So that's not a good sign in my opinion, but what are your thoughts? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=412.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that's just a crazy coincidence and oversight that the right is just gonna be [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=415.44s)]
*  devastated when they find out. They don't care. When you were listing all the things that the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=419.2s)]
*  Department of Education takes care of, they don't care about any of that. They don't want [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=424.64s)]
*  civil rights considerations. They don't care about student loans. They don't care about the standards. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=428.32s)]
*  They don't care about any of that. Again, all of this, and yes, to acknowledge, she says, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=432.88s)]
*  he didn't say he was taking away education. Yeah, I wouldn't if I were him either. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=437.76s)]
*  That doesn't mean that that's not what he's doing. Sometimes, historically, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=443.04s)]
*  politicians have lied. I've seen it in movies. And so look, this is a one billionaire talking [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=446.88s)]
*  about another billionaire's agenda to massively increase inequality in access to education, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=452.4s)]
*  which Randy Weingarten was rightly pointing out. If I wanted to lower standards and increase [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=458.64s)]
*  inequality, I would return to the states. That's what I would do. And you would have, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=465.36s)]
*  in some red states where they do absolutely abysmally in education. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=470.48s)]
*  And now you want to the federal government having any oversight. So that's not going to improve. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=474.88s)]
*  Why would it? They're not gonna increase funding. If you're living in one of the civilized states, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=478.88s)]
*  then yeah, you'll probably still have an okay experience when it comes to education. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=483.28s)]
*  And certainly, if you're rich, it doesn't matter if student loans no longer work or [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=487.04s)]
*  the system shuts down or whatever. The sons of these Republican senators are always gonna be [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=492.32s)]
*  able to go to an Ivy League school. That's never in consideration. They don't need Pell grants [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=498.4s)]
*  to do that. They're gonna be just fine. And so the wealthy are gonna do as well as they always have [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  under this system. But the poor, there's gonna be even less oversight, even less opportunity. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  And why would the Republicans care about that? Our side of the aisle, we're the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=513.84s)]
*  weird, I want kids to be doing chemistry experiments and write novels and stuff like that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  This aspirational Star Trek, everyone pursues their educational dreams thing. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=525.52s)]
*  They don't care about that. They want the kid to be spit out of school at 14 or 15 years old, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=530.56s)]
*  get married, and start processing chickens in a massive plant. That's all they want you to do, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=535.04s)]
*  and that's important work. But I think that you should be able to choose if that's what you wanna [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=541.04s)]
*  do. And their kids always will be able to. Their kids are always gonna have these opportunities. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=544.72s)]
*  They're not listening to the Charlie Kirk's and forgoing higher education. Every single one of [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=551.2s)]
*  their kids is gonna be going to the best school they possibly can as they try to convince their [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=555.76s)]
*  voters to be okay with the fact that we're gonna fall even further and further behind other nations. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=560.4000000000001s)]
*  No, as with Betsy DeVos leading the education department in Trump's first term, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=565.2s)]
*  my number one concern right now is that these for-profit colleges that run as businesses, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=571.76s)]
*  not as institutions of higher learning, are going to just go wild with defrauding students, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=578.16s)]
*  which they've been found guilty of doing in the past. The education department is tasked with [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  investigating institutions that have defrauded students through their recruiting practices. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=589.68s)]
*  And look, the thing is, look, I don't agree with what the mission is here for the Trump [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  administration. Clearly, they wanna privatize education. I think they've been pretty candid [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=604.16s)]
*  about that, to be honest. So this cutesy little thing that they're doing, I'm not fooled by it [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=607.76s)]
*  at all. But I also will say that our public schools have been failing our students, especially in [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=612.88s)]
*  recent years. And that drums up support for the idea of privatizing schools through the voucher [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=619.52s)]
*  program, right? Because think about in states like California, for instance, I don't have kids, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=625.92s)]
*  so I'm not one to complain. But a lot of parents in the state did complain during COVID when schools [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=630.88s)]
*  remained shut. The remote learning did not work out for kids. It's just difficult, right? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=637.6s)]
*  Because their kids sitting in front of a computer and learning that way is difficult to do for an [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=643.76s)]
*  adult, imagine a child. And then on top of that, these parents saw that the private schools were [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=648.64s)]
*  open. And they were mad because they felt that those with means were able to send their kids [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=654.08s)]
*  to school and continue their education while public school kids kinda got screwed. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=659.76s)]
*  And then you look at the test results, and the test results are grim, to say the least. I'll show [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=664.48s)]
*  you an example. Let's put this graph up. So every year, not every year, every other year, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=669.84s)]
*  there's something known as the nation's report card. The federal government puts out data because [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  the education department tracks achievement and success within the school system, public school [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=680.32s)]
*  system. And they test fourth graders and eighth graders specifically every two years. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=686.72s)]
*  And so the assessment found that when it came to fourth graders in 2024, last year, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=692.08s)]
*  fourth grade reading, 69% had scored at least basic on this NAEP test in 2015. Today, only 60% [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=701.2s)]
*  do. Eighth grade reading is pretty bad too. 78% of eighth graders tested at least basic on the test [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=710.56s)]
*  in 2013. Today, only 67% do. For math, eighth graders went from 74% in 2013 to only 61% today. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=719.04s)]
*  The only area where there was actually a little bit of improvement was fourth grade math. They [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=728.24s)]
*  actually went up two points for fourth grade math, but they're still not testing above what the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=734.24s)]
*  levels were in 2019 before the pandemic. The pandemic was devastatingly disruptive. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=741.36s)]
*  But at the same time, the negative impact of what happened on public school campuses as a result of [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=746.4s)]
*  COVID, I think has garnered support for retaliating against the education department and stuff like [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=753.36s)]
*  that. And I don't think that's the solution. I do think we need to fix our public school system. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=760.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't think this is the way. Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree. And I can sort of understand [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=766.0s)]
*  maybe in the short term, they think that would be better if they believe that that switchover [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=771.4399999999999s)]
*  is not going to end up again benefiting the rich. Everyone's gonna have access to the same private [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=776.4s)]
*  schools. Why would that be the case? We've never had access to that in higher education. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=782.64s)]
*  Why the hell would we have that in other levels of education? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=787.04s)]
*  That's a good point. And that's another thing, guys. I get the frustrations [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=789.92s)]
*  with the public school system. I definitely do. However, I do not believe at all that if we move [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  to a completely privatized system, that the government is going to help you afford your [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=800.8s)]
*  child's grade school education. I just don't believe that's gonna happen. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=806.4s)]
*  And by the way, for all of the Republicans who are salivating at the idea that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=810.56s)]
*  privatized schools will lead to the decimation of teachers unions, that's true to some extent. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=815.12s)]
*  However, I was curious. I looked into the public school, not public, private $50,000 a year [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=821.8399999999999s)]
*  school that Tucker Carlson went to, it's called Buckley. Their teachers are unionized. So [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=830.08s)]
*  something to think about. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2a9TBhLAs&t=839.84s)]
