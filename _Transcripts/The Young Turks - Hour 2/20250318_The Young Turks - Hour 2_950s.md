On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Israel BREAKS Ceasefire In Gaza, HUNDREDS KILLED
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q)
*  The ceasefire is very much dead. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=0.0s)]
*  The war is back on as the Israeli military launched a punishing series of deadly airstrikes [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=2.54s)]
*  across the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=8.22s)]
*  The residents that our team in Gaza are speaking with say there was no warning, that it was [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=9.72s)]
*  complete surprise. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=14.0s)]
*  Striking people when they were in their homes or sleeping, of course, in the middle of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=15.36s)]
*  night around 2am aerial strikes were launched in three main areas. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=19.7s)]
*  So in the south, in Khan Yunus, in Dar al-Bala in the center, and also in the north in Gaza [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=23.38s)]
*  City. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=28.68s)]
*  The death toll has just gone up more than 400 people now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=29.68s)]
*  Following weeks of withholding humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, Israel has completely [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=35.76s)]
*  decided to break the ceasefire agreement with Hamas and is now pounding Gaza with airstrikes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=41.56s)]
*  And by the way, hundreds of people have died as a result. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  They've been killed during the holy month of Ramadan, not something Israel has any real [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=52.56s)]
*  concern about. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  Now, let's take a look at footage as I explain what's been happening in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  Strikes pounded the homes of civilians, hit at least one school that had been turned into [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=65.44s)]
*  a shelter and sparked fires in the Al Mawasi refugee camp outside Khan Yunus. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=70.8s)]
*  The ruins of which you can see in the video that we just showed you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=77.8s)]
*  So there was also a hit on a home in Rafa that killed 17 members of the same family. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=82.2s)]
*  Something that commonly happens with Israeli airstrikes and this is supposed to fight Hamas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=90.36s)]
*  How exactly? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=95.36s)]
*  But let me continue. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=96.36s)]
*  And that's by the way, according to the European Hospital, they reported that 17 members of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  the same family were killed as a result of that airstrike. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=105.94s)]
*  Five senior Hamas officials were also killed in the strikes, including members of the party's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=112.86s)]
*  political bureau, interior ministry, and internal security services. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=117.3s)]
*  I'm sure that as they continue killing Hamas members, new Hamas members aren't gonna sprout [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  up as a result of innocent people getting killed, as a result of people's innocent family [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=128.84s)]
*  members getting brutalized in these ways. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=134.18s)]
*  Now hospitals are already overwhelmed. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=137.46s)]
*  And yet, again, there were piles of bodies in plastic sheets stacked up as a result of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  these airstrikes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=148.34s)]
*  Gaza's health ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=149.34s)]
*  560. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  Sahir al-Wahidi, head of the ministry's records department said at least 263 of those killed [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  were women or children under the age of 18. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=162.74s)]
*  He described it as the deadliest day in Gaza since the start of the war. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=166.42s)]
*  And there are, of course, ongoing efforts to recover bodies from under the rubble. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=172.14s)]
*  So what's the excuse this time for targeting areas where displaced Palestinians were sheltering? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=178.7s)]
*  Well, get a load of this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=183.26s)]
*  This is an amazing, amazing fact. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  So the Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement today that it's overnight strikes targeting [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=186.54s)]
*  Hamas commanders and officials in Gaza were preemptive, will continue as long as necessary, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=192.46s)]
*  and will expand beyond airstrikes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  And now the Israeli military is also ordering people to evacuate eastern Gaza and head toward [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=203.62s)]
*  the center of the strip, suggesting that Israel could also start up their ground operations [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=209.7s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=215.62s)]
*  And as of right now, there have been no retaliatory strikes carried out by Hamas. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=216.94s)]
*  By the way, I mean, calling this a war is pretty gross considering the fact that you're [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=222.14s)]
*  dealing with the Israeli side, has a military supported, aided and abetted by the United [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  States and its war machine. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=231.7s)]
*  On the Palestinian side, they do not have a standing military. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=233.98s)]
*  Hamas doesn't have a military. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=238.14s)]
*  They don't have the same weaponry. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, treating Hamas as if it is the same type of threat that Israel poses to innocent [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=240.89999999999998s)]
*  Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for that matter is laughable to say the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  least and also disgusting. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=252.98s)]
*  And tragically, the group's leaders have made it clear that Israel's resumption of attacks [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  is bad news for the hostages. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=261.7s)]
*  So senior Hamas official Isat al-Risheq said that Netanyahu's decision to resume war is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=264.02s)]
*  a decision to sacrifice the captives and impose a death sentence on them. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=271.18s)]
*  Now of the hostages, there are about 59 remaining in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=276.14000000000004s)]
*  More than half of them are believed to be dead. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=280.38s)]
*  Still Israel has no intention of stopping. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=283.62s)]
*  Netanyahu ordered the airstrikes after Hamas refused Israeli demands to essentially change [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=286.70000000000005s)]
*  the terms of the ceasefire agreement. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=293.38s)]
*  Israel and Hamas agreed to an initial ceasefire and hostage release deal in mid-January, the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=296.42s)]
*  first phase of which lasted 42 days. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=301.38s)]
*  In accordance with that deal, Hamas released 33 Israeli and dual national hostages, among [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=304.1s)]
*  them two Americans, while Israel freed about 1800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=310.38s)]
*  agreed to increase the amount of aid into the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=316.58s)]
*  Now that was stage one of the ceasefire agreement. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=321.18s)]
*  The idea was that they would negotiate during phase one in order to come to an agreement [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=324.98s)]
*  for phase two and begin talks to define the ceasefire second phase, that never happened. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=330.7s)]
*  And, Boz, I'm gonna bring you in right now because I don't think that was ever, ever [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=337.82s)]
*  the Israeli government's intention. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=343.26s)]
*  I mean, I knew from the beginning as soon as Hamas returns the hostages, which is really [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=345.02s)]
*  their only bargaining chips, the Israeli government's gonna finish the job that they started, which [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=350.38s)]
*  is the complete annihilation and genocide of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=355.62s)]
*  And that's happening right now as we speak. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=361.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you paid attention to any of the rhetoric that was coming out of Israel [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=363.14000000000004s)]
*  from Netanyahu to pretty much everybody in his cabinet, but part of his coalition, they [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=368.22s)]
*  hated the deal from the beginning. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=374.02000000000004s)]
*  They've talked about breaking the deal from the beginning. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=376.06s)]
*  This isn't a secret that they didn't wanna do this deal. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  The only reason that it happened in the first place was pressure from Wyckoff and the Trump [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=382.74s)]
*  administration. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=388.1s)]
*  That's the only way any changes are going to happen to this policy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=389.82s)]
*  It has to be the Americans and our sort of foreign policy establishment, the president, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=396.46000000000004s)]
*  plus his cabinet and all these other people, to exert pressure on Israel to stop. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=404.14s)]
*  They're not going to do it on their own. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=411.1s)]
*  We have to withhold weaponry. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=414.82000000000005s)]
*  We have to exert pressure as we are the global hegemon. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=416.82000000000005s)]
*  We are the global force in the world and it's not Israel. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=421.98s)]
*  So they're doing this at RBS. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=426.46000000000004s)]
*  I think the only hope was that Donald Trump would wanna preserve his own deal. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=429.02000000000004s)]
*  The deal that his guys went over there and negotiated, what listeners have to know is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=435.04s)]
*  that there's been an extreme pressure campaign out in DC from the Israel lobby to basically [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  renege on the deal. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=450.92s)]
*  There's just no two ways about it and it's coming from everywhere. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=452.16s)]
*  Just the other day, one of Trump's little cabinet officials, administration officials, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=457.72s)]
*  excuse me, got fired, got let go, basically because he said something that made Palestinians [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=462.76000000000005s)]
*  seem like human beings and that was it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=470.36s)]
*  They got him out of there just for talking like that publicly. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=472.8s)]
*  And so yeah, the only hope was that, let's not get it twisted too. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=476.8s)]
*  Obviously, this is the exact same policy Joe Biden pursued. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=482.20000000000005s)]
*  There's no daylight between Trump and Joe Biden on this. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=486.0s)]
*  It's essentially allow the Israelis to do every single thing that they want. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=489.18s)]
*  The only hope was that, you know what, Trump wanted to sort of take the sort of reputational [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=493.86s)]
*  and historic win and be like, you know what, I'm gonna be the peacemaker. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=499.18s)]
*  I'm gonna preserve this deal. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=503.62s)]
*  And that hope has obviously collapsed here. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=505.9s)]
*  And it's all sad and I know I've been going on a little long here, but I think it's important [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=509.46s)]
*  for people to understand they've leveled the place. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=513.66s)]
*  There's nothing left to attack. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=516.1s)]
*  There's nothing left to do. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=518.94s)]
*  They have not put a dent in Hamas's numbers. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=519.94s)]
*  In fact, they have more recruits now than they did before this siege actually started. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=523.9000000000001s)]
*  There's no actual strategic coherence here. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=530.1400000000001s)]
*  This is just death for death's sake and nothing else. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=534.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's wiping out Palestinians in order to take control of the Gaza Strip. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=537.86s)]
*  Make no mistake about it, similar things are happening over in the West Bank. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=543.86s)]
*  Who have done nothing wrong or being chased out of their homes, they're being victimized. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=548.22s)]
*  And this is all happening with the support of the American government. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=552.78s)]
*  And by the way, let me be clear. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=557.14s)]
*  I wanna just really emphasize what was said there, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=559.1s)]
*  It doesn't matter if we're talking about the Biden administration or the Trump administration. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=562.58s)]
*  Now Trump is even more transactional than other presidents, right? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=566.9399999999999s)]
*  You pay him, he'll do anything, okay? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=571.04s)]
*  Top prostitute in the country. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=573.02s)]
*  When it comes to Biden, I mean, Biden created the situation for [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=574.94s)]
*  Trump to take control of upon winning the election. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=580.14s)]
*  So I'm sorry, the Biden administration can eat a penis as well. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=585.1s)]
*  I don't wanna use a word that I'm not allowed to use here on TYT. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=589.38s)]
*  But nonetheless, Hamas wanted to move on to negotiations for [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=592.98s)]
*  a permanent end to this war, a full withdrawal of Israeli forces [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=597.82s)]
*  under the terms of the original ceasefire agreement. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=602.98s)]
*  Netanyahu is known to pull the rug from underneath both the US government and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=606.1800000000001s)]
*  Hamas in regard to the already agreed upon ceasefire deal. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=611.2600000000001s)]
*  He wants to change the terms, knowing that Hamas will reject it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=614.94s)]
*  And then that paves the way for the Israeli defense forces to continue their aerial [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=618.6600000000001s)]
*  bombardments to kill countless civilians on the Palestinian side. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=622.9000000000001s)]
*  In early March, Israel halted all food, fuel, medicine, and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=628.3s)]
*  other supplies flowing into the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=632.34s)]
*  And threatened additional consequences if Hamas didn't accept the terms [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=635.14s)]
*  of the new ceasefire deal. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=640.14s)]
*  Here's more from Jeremy Diamond. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=642.78s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister in launching this offensive last night said that it was [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=645.62s)]
*  launched because of Hamas's repeated refusal to release hostages. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=650.5s)]
*  Here's a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry this morning. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=654.42s)]
*  Concrete proposals made by the American special envoy to extend the ceasefire. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=658.5s)]
*  Hamas said no. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=667.9s)]
*  So with no other choice, Israel is forced to carry out this activity. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=671.06s)]
*  As you can hear, that is the Israeli government's justification. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=678.46s)]
*  But it is, of course, important to note that Hamas said it was willing to continue [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=681.42s)]
*  to negotiate while it rejected that proposal from Steve Witkoff. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=685.42s)]
*  It wanted to go back to the deal that Israel and Hamas both signed onto. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=689.06s)]
*  Meaning negotiating phase two of this ceasefire agreement, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=693.06s)]
*  which would entail an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of all Israeli [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=696.54s)]
*  troops. But in recent weeks, the Israeli government has made clear it was not [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=700.3s)]
*  interested in negotiating that phase two agreement. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=703.86s)]
*  Instead, looking to get more hostages out of Gaza without engaging [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=706.9s)]
*  in those overall negotiations. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=712.62s)]
*  So let me elaborate further on what Jeremy Dimon just said in regard to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=716.34s)]
*  Israel's new proposal, changing the terms of the ceasefire deal. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=720.54s)]
*  So Israel proposed a new plan that would require Hamas to release half of its [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=725.78s)]
*  remaining hostages, the militant group's main bargaining chip in exchange for [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=731.54s)]
*  a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=735.3s)]
*  Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners though, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=739.02s)]
*  a key component of the first phase. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=743.86s)]
*  So just randomly deciding to change the terms of the ceasefire deal, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=746.54s)]
*  in my opinion, is very much intentionally done in order to create a situation in [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=750.3s)]
*  which Netanyahu can continue the aerial bombardments and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=754.54s)]
*  the slaughter of innocent Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=757.42s)]
*  They just want to wipe those people out, either through ethnic cleansing or [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=760.3s)]
*  through a mass killing campaign. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=763.78s)]
*  You see it playing out right in front of you. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=765.98s)]
*  But if the federal government in the United States just trample on the free [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=768.06s)]
*  expression rights of the American people a little more, or maybe they won't be able [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=773.5s)]
*  to see what they're seeing with their own two eyes, or [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=777.34s)]
*  read what they're reading with their own two eyes. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=779.8199999999999s)]
*  We all see what's happening, okay? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=781.9399999999999s)]
*  You can go ahead and try to silence those who disagree and are disgusted with [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=783.78s)]
*  what's happening by the Israeli government right now, but [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=788.8199999999999s)]
*  make no mistake about it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=792.74s)]
*  You can try to censor people, you're not going to censor an idea, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=794.9399999999999s)]
*  you're not going to stop them from thinking for themselves. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=798.26s)]
*  And I think Americans see what's happening in Gaza right now, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=801.7s)]
*  they know it's wrong, regardless of how much Israel lobby money flows into [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=805.38s)]
*  the coffers of our disgusting corrupt politicians. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=810.26s)]
*  Waz, any final words on this? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=813.82s)]
*  I think it's always bears mentioning the actual state of play over there. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=816.98s)]
*  These people, their entire identity, the Palestinian people, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=822.6600000000001s)]
*  is based on their belief that they should get to stay on their land. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=828.5s)]
*  The land that they've lived on for generations and centuries, okay? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=834.8199999999999s)]
*  And that their ancestors lived on, so they're not going to voluntarily leave. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=840.4599999999999s)]
*  Israel's neighbors in Jordan and Egypt have already said, trillions of times, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=846.14s)]
*  we're not going to take them in. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=851.9399999999999s)]
*  Not because we have these pure hearts, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=854.38s)]
*  no, because it would be actual political suicide for us in our own countries. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=857.18s)]
*  Our regimes would collapse. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=862.66s)]
*  So when it comes to aiding Israel in their ethnic cleansing and [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=865.34s)]
*  mass genocide of the Palestinian people in the land of Palestine, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=870.62s)]
*  or my entire political collapse, the choice is obvious. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=875.98s)]
*  So they're not going to be able to push these people into Egypt or Jordan. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=880.9399999999999s)]
*  The only two things they can do are forcibly bring troops down there and [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=885.98s)]
*  forcibly remove the basically, I guess, million or so people that still remain, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=891.4200000000001s)]
*  which would take a massive undertaking. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=898.3800000000001s)]
*  Would be like, I'm talking about war crimes and [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=901.58s)]
*  atrocities on a scale that we just literally have not seen. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=905.7s)]
*  They can do that and try to forcibly move these folks out of there, or [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=910.1400000000001s)]
*  they can just drop massive bombs and just kill them, millions of people that way. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=914.78s)]
*  And again, I think they know politically, that's just untenable if they [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=919.86s)]
*  want to have good relations with their neighbors. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=925.4599999999999s)]
*  They don't have an easy solution, their only solution is just slow, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=929.62s)]
*  trickle, and hope that eventually they can push these folks out. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=934.5s)]
*  Yeah, with our bombs, it's disgusting, absolutely disgusting. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=940.14s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=943.38s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLMoC3_v9Q&t=946.46s)]
