"Sam‚Äôs correct. The only reason that anybody even knows who I am is because of Joe Rogan.

I should have earned it the old fashioned way: by having my mother create the Golden Girls."

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Sam Harris TRASHES Joe Rogan For Hosting Israel-Critic Dave Smith
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc)
*  Joe is a genuinely good guy who wants good things for people. But he is honestly in over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=0.0s)]
*  his head on so many topics of great consequence, right? When he brings someone on to just shoot [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  the about how the Holocaust is not what you think it was, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=16.62s)]
*  Or maybe Churchill's the bad guy in World War II. Or he's got Dave Smith being treated [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=21.64s)]
*  as an expert on Israel and Palestine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=29.16s)]
*  Things are getting pretty heated between Sam Harris and libertarian comedian Dave Smith [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=37.64s)]
*  over the issue of Israel. Now, there might be some issues that we disagree with Dave [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=43.72s)]
*  Smith on, but I'm speaking for myself. He's absolutely correct on Israel. And in fact, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=47.92s)]
*  I love hearing him on various shows spitting the truth about what's been going on in regard [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=52.68s)]
*  to Israel's persecution and land theft of Palestinians. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=58.96s)]
*  Now, Harrison Artin's Israel defender got his dander up about Joe Rogan hosting Smith [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=64.16s)]
*  and allowing him to speak out against the genocide in Gaza. Take a look. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=71.84s)]
*  He's got Dave Smith being treated as an expert on Israel and Palestine and the history of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=76.44s)]
*  that conflict and the moral emergency that came to the world's attention on October 7th. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=88.24s)]
*  And what is appropriate to think in the aftermath of all of that, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  The only reason why anyone knows what Dave Smith thinks about any of this is very likely [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=102.24s)]
*  because Joe had him on multiple times to talk about it, right? He's a pure misinformation [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=107.36s)]
*  artist. It is irresponsible. I mean, it is directly harmful. Our society is as politically [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=113.84s)]
*  shattered as it is in part because of how Joe has interacted with information. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=119.72s)]
*  A little bit of specificity would be helpful in this situation in which he's throwing jabs [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  at Dave Smith for allegedly spreading misinformation about Israel. Because everything that I've heard [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=131.68s)]
*  him say about Israel has been accurate. It's just that usually in American media, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=137.12s)]
*  telling the truth about Israel is not allowed. But Joe Rogan kind of creates a loophole to that, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=142.8s)]
*  doesn't he? Yeah, so Dave Smith is a huge problem for [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=148.0s)]
*  supporters of Israel. So one, he's armed with excellent facts. And so you're not gonna be able [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=152.64s)]
*  to shake him off of his game. So any of the nonsense talking points that they have prepared, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=160.16s)]
*  the same propaganda that we're all deal with. They're human shields, Hamas made us kill them [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=164.64s)]
*  all. America is a special ally. And in order to save Western civilization, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=170.72s)]
*  we must murder more Palestinians, right? All this stuff he knocks down easily. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=176.48s)]
*  Second of all, they can't call him anti-Semitic, so it's driving them crazy, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=181.68s)]
*  right? Cuz they're one trick ponies. Anytime anybody's a critic of Israel, anti-Semites, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=185.44s)]
*  right? And so that's not working. And so they're super frustrated. I mean, look at the words that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=191.12s)]
*  Sam Harris uses. The moral emergency that came to the world's attention on October 7th. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=197.12s)]
*  So the occupation for 58 years is not a moral emergency. Slaughtering over 50,000 Palestinians [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  is not a moral emergency. Slaughtering over 15,000 children. Not a moral emergency at all, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=210.4s)]
*  at all, beloved moral Israel. I can't believe Dave Smith gets it wrong by not realizing how moral [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=216.56s)]
*  the IDF is and how the Palestinians deserve to be slaughtered. What's wrong with your day? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=223.6s)]
*  Why are you treating them like they're other human beings? Don't you know that Israeli's lives are [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  worth a billion any other life? Okay, that's the real moral emergency here. So guys, we're open [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=233.76s)]
*  minded and we do nuance here. So there's some things that Sam Harris says about the Trump [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=239.68s)]
*  administration, etc. That I agree with, okay? So I don't have to shut off everything when it comes [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=244.96s)]
*  to Sam Harris or Dave Smith. And I massively disagree with Dave on social security. Happy to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=250.72s)]
*  debate that, etc., right? And there's issues. But on Israel, Sam Harris is in that Bill Maher [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=256.16s)]
*  group of I don't care about any other issue. We're gonna paint all Muslims as evil and violent and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=262.88s)]
*  savages. And we're gonna just support Israel as they slaughter and slaughter, occupy and occupy [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=269.2s)]
*  and grab more land. And if anyone dares criticize, including Dave Smith or anyone else, anyone on the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=275.36s)]
*  right or the left, we're gonna call them anti-Semites terrorists, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=280.88s)]
*  blah, blah, and we're gonna do propaganda. Well, too bad, Sam, you just got caught. You got caught [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=285.68s)]
*  by the right, the left and everyone in the middle. In fact, let's trigger him a little more. Here's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=291.44s)]
*  a little taste, a little tasty taste of Dave Smith absolutely killing it on Rogan's podcast. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=297.28s)]
*  We're going into 60 years of complete Israeli control over these people. And under Israeli [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=302.4s)]
*  control, they have zero rights, zero rights whatsoever. I mean, they don't have the freedom [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  of movement. They don't have freedom to trade with the outside world. They don't have voting rights. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=317.2s)]
*  They don't have the right of due process. Maybe the US shouldn't be funding and arming the whole [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  goddamn conflict. Maybe we shouldn't have a system where our political class is not allowed [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=326.32s)]
*  to criticize a foreign government. And a foreign government that's gotten us into seven wars, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=332.48s)]
*  at least played a large role in getting us into those wars explicitly. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=340.0s)]
*  Preach it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=343.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  Now, Dave Smith did respond to Sam Harris writing on X in response to Harris. Sam's correct. The [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=346.08s)]
*  only reason that anybody even knows who I am is because of Joe Rogan. I should have earned it the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=353.76s)]
*  old fashioned way by having my mother create the golden girls, effing clown. Now look, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=358.96s)]
*  I didn't realize that Sam Harris's mother created the golden girls. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=365.52s)]
*  It makes me like him a little more. But with that said, in this fight, in this tiff, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to side with Dave Smith for speaking the truth. And look, there are a lot of people [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=375.92s)]
*  out there who know Sam Harris specifically because of his appearances on Joe Rogan. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=380.96s)]
*  Okay, so don't be the gatekeeper in regard to who Joe Rogan's allowed to speak to because you don't [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=386.4s)]
*  like what one of his guests had to say accurately about how Israel's been prosecuting this war in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=391.68s)]
*  Gaza. Well, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, we have got a winner. That's what they're actually [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  worried about. So Dave Smith's a thorn on their side because they can't use their tricks on him. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  And he keeps pointing out things that are true, like, well, we've given him $300 billion. Why are [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  we letting this foreign country control us? Now normally they go, I'm a decent man, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=410.72s)]
*  troupes, but they can't do that to Dave. So, it's just nuts, right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=415.04s)]
*  So number two, though, the bigger point, he's influencing Rogan and the bro sphere. And now [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=419.68s)]
*  the Sam Harris of the world realize how important Rogan and the bro shows are. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=427.12s)]
*  And so they're panicked about losing them because it's much easier to control Fox News. You just [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=431.6s)]
*  need one guy, Rupert Murdoch. And Murdoch's been on the side of Israel his entire career, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=436.88s)]
*  right? So Murdoch orders all of his dogs on Fox News say support Israel 100%. You're not [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=441.04s)]
*  ever allowed to criticize them. And that could be a firing offense at Fox News. So the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=448.0s)]
*  propaganda on the right wing was on lockdown. Now here comes Joe Rogan and all these bros. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=452.4s)]
*  And they're like, no, I mean, we like Trump. Part of the reason we kind of like Trump [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=458.08s)]
*  is because he's America first. And not this Israel first crap is not that interesting to us. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=463.84s)]
*  And by the way, Rogan- [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=469.84s)]
*  And Dave's egging that on in an awesome way. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  He is egging that on in an awesome way. And I wanna give credit to Rogan because despite [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  any disagreements I've had with Rogan in the past, he's always been pretty good on the issue of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=477.84s)]
*  Israel. Yeah, and you know why? Because look, that is common sense. So that's like, wait, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=482.0s)]
*  why did we give them $300 billion and get nothing in return? Why did we start all these wars on [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=488.0s)]
*  their behalf and get nothing in return? Why do we continue to give them a blank check as they [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=492.8s)]
*  slaughter 50 times the number of people Hamas did? How does that help America? Why are we on the side [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=498.0s)]
*  of that? So look, last thing for me on all this is, so Sam has been pushing the anti-Muslim hate [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  for decades. So I had a three hour debate with him here on the Young Turks. I can't believe it, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  but I think it's been over a decade now that we had that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=518.4s)]
*  It has. And back then, what was his thing? He's like, I think they were calling themselves new [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=520.7199999999999s)]
*  atheists at that time. And the whole point of, it shouldn't have been, I'm an atheist, right? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=526.56s)]
*  But Sam misdirected that group into saying, no, no, the whole point of new atheists is, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=532.0s)]
*  all the religions are not good and we don't believe them, but the Muslims are the worst. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=537.28s)]
*  The Muslims are the most violent, the worst, most despicable religion and culture. Remember, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=542.4799999999999s)]
*  they should always be occupied by Israel. So Sam, you're caught in every way. Everybody [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=547.92s)]
*  knows your tricks now. And I wanna bolster what Dave Smith believes and what he's been saying [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=554.64s)]
*  in these interviews because every day there's a new atrocious, awful story involving innocent [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=561.12s)]
*  people getting slaughtered by the IDF, by Israeli settlers. And I wanna talk a little bit about 14 [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=568.8s)]
*  year old Amer Robby, an American citizen from Saddlebrook, New Jersey, who was shot dead by [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=576.24s)]
*  Israeli forces on Sunday in the West Bank for allegedly throwing stones. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=584.48s)]
*  Okay, the IDF apparently believes a 14 year old boy is deserving of death if he allegedly throws [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=591.92s)]
*  stones. And I say allegedly because I don't believe anything that the IDF says. They've been caught in [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=600.72s)]
*  way too many lies for me to be naive enough to believe anything that they say at face value. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=605.28s)]
*  So with that in mind, the shooting happened in Turmus Aya, which is known colloquially [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  as Little America because around 85% of the population is, well, they have US citizenship. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so the Israeli military said its soldiers opened fire during a counter-terrorism operation [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  in the area when they saw three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=632.24s)]
*  thus endangering civilians driving. The shots that Robby faced prove fatal. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=638.0s)]
*  His friend Ayub Jabara, 15, also an American citizen, is in intensive care in Ramallah, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=646.0s)]
*  according to the mayor. Their other friend, a 15 year old, was also hospitalized by the attack. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=654.0s)]
*  So here's Robby's relative recounting what allegedly happened. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=661.36s)]
*  It's absolutely disgusting. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=691.36s)]
*  So to combat the criticism that Israel knew was coming, the Israeli military shared a blurry [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=705.76s)]
*  10 second video purportedly showing the incident. Now, you're looking at the video right now, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  you can't really see much at all, but you can see three figures. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=719.68s)]
*  At the end of the clip, one of the people appears to throw an object, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=725.68s)]
*  and that's what they're using to justify killing a 14 year old boy. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=729.68s)]
*  Now, if you're wondering what else we're hearing, hilariously, the Israeli military said it would [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=734.4s)]
*  continue operating in the West Bank to protect the residents in the area. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=739.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's after the Israeli settlers murder Palestinians. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=744.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=748.4s)]
*  They'll protect the murderers and help them murder more Palestinians. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=748.56s)]
*  So I should note, we haven't heard a damn thing from President Donald Trump in regard to an [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  American citizen getting killed by IDF forces. But there is a statement from a State Department [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=758.56s)]
*  spokesperson who offered condolences to the family and said the US was aware of the IDF statement, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=767.04s)]
*  but said out of respect for the family's privacy would have no further comment at this time. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=772.96s)]
*  That doesn't respect the family at all. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=778.0s)]
*  That says to the family, even though you're an American citizen, we don't care about you at all. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=779.52s)]
*  Our beloved Israel has murdered you and we won't even say we're sorry or they're sorry, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=783.84s)]
*  or there's gonna be any consequences. They not only open fire in the West Bank, which is very [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=790.1600000000001s)]
*  normal for the IDF, they murder people there on the regular, okay? And there's no consequences, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=796.72s)]
*  their kangaroo courts say that they're not guilty over 99% of the time. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=802.08s)]
*  There's absolutely no justice in Israel for Palestinians. Israel is one of the most atrocious, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=806.1600000000001s)]
*  barbaric states in how they deal with the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Those poor people have no [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=811.5200000000001s)]
*  rights at all. They're murdered wantonly by the Israeli settlers and the police and the IDF. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=816.96s)]
*  And there's never and almost never any punishment. Okay, now they didn't just open fire in the West [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=823.5200000000001s)]
*  Bank, they opened fire in Little America, a place known as Little America. You know why they did [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=829.52s)]
*  that? Because they know there's gonna be no consequences. They know that both Biden and [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=833.6s)]
*  Trump were in their back pocket. So when they murdered two Americans recently under Biden, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=837.76s)]
*  Biden was nearly apologizing to Israel, right? Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry our American [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=842.88s)]
*  boys got in the way of your beautiful, moral Israeli bullets. We're so sorry. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=849.84s)]
*  Now to be fair, that wasn't the exact statement, but there was no consequence at all. They said, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=855.12s)]
*  don't worry, just like Trump, the Israelis will investigate this. And of course, they'll find [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=858.96s)]
*  themselves completely innocent. You know one time the Israelis murdered an American. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=863.2s)]
*  She was a Christian girl that went to protest what was happening. This was a while back. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=869.2800000000001s)]
*  And they ran her over with a steamroller and the most gruesome death you've ever seen. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  And the Israeli court said, it was an accident. There will be no legal consequences. You could [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=880.64s)]
*  murder Americans all day, all night if you're Israel. No consequences. So sometimes people say, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=886.8s)]
*  hey, Cenk, you wanna go to Israel? I'm like, what are you nuts? They'd murder me in a second, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=892.9599999999999s)]
*  dump my body somewhere in a mass grave, and American presidents will celebrate as long as [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=898.16s)]
*  the cash clears. So- This is the third time since February [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=903.52s)]
*  that Israel has killed an American citizen. Third time since February, at least, that we know of. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=909.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, nothing's gonna get done because America second or 18th, Israel always first, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=915.6s)]
*  always under all administrations finally. Guys, just think about it morally from your own [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=923.12s)]
*  perspective. Now, let's take their worst case scenario. Let's take the idea of add its word, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=929.84s)]
*  which you should never do. But let's take their fact pattern here. And they say, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=934.96s)]
*  these three 14 year olds threw rocks at cars that were passing by. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=939.6s)]
*  Now, if somebody, 14 year olds threw rocks at my car, I'd be super mad. And I'm sure you would too, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=943.6s)]
*  right? You'd stop, you'd see they were 14 year olds, and you'd chase them away presumably or [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=948.96s)]
*  do something, call the police, etc. Would you murder them? Would you? I'm asking you a real [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=953.84s)]
*  question. You see they're 14 year olds, would you shoot, and they shot all three of them. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=961.76s)]
*  It's just two of them. One's in bad shape, but survived. The other one got grazed. This [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=966.96s)]
*  poor kid got killed. Would you try to murder all three of those 14 year olds for throwing a rock? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=971.68s)]
*  I know I wouldn't. There's no way I would. I don't care. Palestinian, Israeli, American, Chinese, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=978.64s)]
*  I don't care. There's no way I murder those poor kids. But no, Israel's like, no, the moral thing [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=984.4799999999999s)]
*  to do is to slaughter them. And they're Americans, who cares? We control America completely. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=991.04s)]
*  Washington is occupied territory. APAC was the number one donor in this campaign cycle. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=998.08s)]
*  If you're pretending that had no influence on our politicians, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=1004.88s)]
*  you're a moron or a liar of epic proportions. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNdgOTT6scc&t=1008.24s)]
