"A stubborn grandfather had a motorway built around his house in China after refusing to move, despite being offered ¬£180,000 in compensation.

Huang Ping‚Äôs two-storey home in Jinxi, China, is now surrounded by a construction site with constant dust, noisy builders and vibrating walls.

He says he now regrets not taking the Chinese government‚Äôs money and fears what living in his property will be like once the expressway opens in Spring."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Elderly Chinese Man: "I Lost A BIG BET To The Government"
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk)
*  A very stubborn elderly man in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=0.0s)]
*  China refused to sell his house to [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=1.76s)]
*  the Chinese government. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=3.6s)]
*  He wasn't happy with the offer they [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=4.84s)]
*  gave him, but China wanted to build [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=6.96s)]
*  a motorway and his house was in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  the way. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  He rejected the offer, which was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=12.56s)]
*  actually not a small amount of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=14.5s)]
*  money. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=16.3s)]
*  So Huang Ping is the name of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=16.84s)]
*  the guy who rejected the offer. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=18.8s)]
*  Ping had been offered $220,653 and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  two other properties which were [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=24.32s)]
*  later increased to three, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=27.0s)]
*  the secretary of the Jingzhi [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=29.32s)]
*  County Party Committee previously [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=31.96s)]
*  said that he refused to relocate [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=34.92s)]
*  because he was dissatisfied with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=37.28s)]
*  the government's offer. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=39.58s)]
*  Anyway, well now he's regretting [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  that decision because the government [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  decided to build the motorway [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  anyway, it's just that they built [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=47.6s)]
*  it on top of his house. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=49.8s)]
*  You're going to love this picture. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=51.32s)]
*  No. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=54.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=54.74s)]
*  No, so the house in the middle of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=55.44s)]
*  the highway or motorway is what [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=57.4s)]
*  we're talking about. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=59.24s)]
*  Look, this is the kind of stuff [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=60.68s)]
*  that makes me anti-government. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=62.96s)]
*  That's so interesting. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=66.32s)]
*  I'm super anti-government. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=67.2s)]
*  I have a completely different take [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=67.8s)]
*  on this story. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=68.72s)]
*  Look, this is his home, okay? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=69.24s)]
*  I hate eminent domain, I do, okay? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=71.36s)]
*  We got to build a freeway that's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=74.8s)]
*  going to tear a community apart. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=76.76s)]
*  We're going to demolish beautiful [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=79.0s)]
*  craftsman style homes, okay, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=81.56s)]
*  in Los Angeles to build this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=83.68s)]
*  garbage. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=85.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=86.52s)]
*  I hate it, I do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=87.02s)]
*  No, I hear you, but eminent domain, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=88.6s)]
*  for me, it depends, right? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=90.36s)]
*  What are we building if we're [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=92.0s)]
*  building a mall because somebody [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=93.44s)]
*  wants to get rich off of it? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  I don't know about that, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  But if we're building an absolutely [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=98.16s)]
*  essential railway, maybe sometimes [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=100.44s)]
*  we got to do eminent domain. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=102.74s)]
*  So in this case, I got a completely [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  different takeaway on it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  Look at the Chinese government, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=108.52s)]
*  man, they can't be stopped. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=109.88s)]
*  This is centralized planning, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  It's got its huge downsides, but [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  it does have this one upside of, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=114.92s)]
*  they move and they move fast. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=118.36s)]
*  So they're like, you're getting in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=119.0s)]
*  the way of our highway? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=120.24s)]
*  No, you're not, we're just going to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  move right around you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  We're gone, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=123.08s)]
*  you don't even know what happened. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm already past it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=125.16s)]
*  The cars are already going by. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=126.96s)]
*  And look, and sometimes, and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=128.64s)]
*  he says, I feel like I lost [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=130.24s)]
*  a big bet. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=131.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what happened. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  You bet that they wouldn't be able [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=134.8s)]
*  to do it, or [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=136.16s)]
*  that you'd get more money for it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=136.72s)]
*  I don't think he wanted more money, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=138.48s)]
*  I really think he didn't want to do [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  it, and he lost the bet. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=141.68s)]
*  Because it's his home, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  he loves his home, okay? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  The government forcing you to give [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  up your home, yeah, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=147.56s)]
*  they offered him some money, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=148.4s)]
*  they offered him other properties. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=149.48s)]
*  They offered him a lot of money, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=150.68s)]
*  and in China, that is a king's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=152.04s)]
*  ransom. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  No, I know, but your home is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  special, there's an emotional [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=155.44s)]
*  attachment to it, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=157.12s)]
*  there's sentimental value to it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  It's your refuge, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=159.64s)]
*  it's your safe place, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=160.48s)]
*  it's what you love. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  The government coming in and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  snatching that from you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=163.76s)]
*  is unacceptable. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  But they didn't snatch it, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=166.12s)]
*  they offered a lot of money. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=167.12s)]
*  But we have no idea how necessary [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=168.32s)]
*  that highway is. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  It might be not that necessary, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=172.16s)]
*  it might be enormously necessary, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=173.72s)]
*  especially in China with all [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=175.56s)]
*  the population and you got to go [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=177.12s)]
*  back and forth, okay. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=178.84s)]
*  This is so [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=180.0s)]
*  indicative of the Chinese [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=180.56s)]
*  government, it's always their way [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=181.72s)]
*  or the highway. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=183.24s)]
*  She's here all week, okay, but [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=185.04s)]
*  it's true, both for the better and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  for us, silver lining here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=190.0s)]
*  Tourists have started to come and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=192.84s)]
*  look at his house, so [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=194.24s)]
*  they're now thinking about charging [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=195.24s)]
*  money to the tourists. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQh9PlHhuk&t=197.32s)]
