TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

What does The Young Turks mean? Why is the show named The Young Turks?

The selection of the name The Young Turks reflects the definition provided in American Heritage Dictionary.

Young Turk (n.)

Young, progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement or political party.

The selection of this name does not refer to any specific, historical incarnation of The Young Turks.

*  Well, that was a small snippet of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=5.04s)]
*  a bizarre and pretty gross AI [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=7.9s)]
*  generated video that Donald Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=10.34s)]
*  had posted on Truth Social showing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  what his vision for Gaza is. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=15.84s)]
*  A gaudy resort town built on stolen [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  land paid for by the American [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=20.64s)]
*  people. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=22.7s)]
*  Let's watch the whole thing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=23.28s)]
*  Donald Trump is coming to set you free, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=30.0s)]
*  bringing the light for all to see. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=37.08s)]
*  No more tunnels, no more fear, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=39.16s)]
*  Fahqaza is finally here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump Gaza shining bright, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=43.6s)]
*  golden future, a brand new life. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=45.44s)]
*  Feast and dance, the deal is done. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Trump Gaza number one. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=49.84s)]
*  Trump Gaza shining bright, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=51.92s)]
*  golden future, a brand new life. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=53.8s)]
*  Feast and dance, the deal is done. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=56.08s)]
*  Trump Gaza number one. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  Okay, well, look, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=62.72s)]
*  he didn't create the video, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=63.8s)]
*  someone else did. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=65.36s)]
*  But he did feel the need to post it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=66.36s)]
*  and this comes after Cenk. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=68.2s)]
*  He had made comments about how the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=70.0s)]
*  US is going to take Gaza. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=72.2s)]
*  At first, he said that our soldiers [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=74.88s)]
*  were going to be stationed in Gaza, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=77.4s)]
*  essentially protecting the land as [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=80.08s)]
*  moneyed interests and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=82.84s)]
*  Trump associated companies and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=84.64s)]
*  build a resort town. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=87.64s)]
*  But then he backed off a little bit [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=89.92s)]
*  of that messaging, but [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=91.84s)]
*  he's still dead set on taking over [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  Gaza to make money. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=95.0s)]
*  So look, the other thing we're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=96.28s)]
*  underestimating here and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  is something that I was obsessed [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=99.36s)]
*  by in his first term, which is how [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=101.12s)]
*  unintelligent Donald Trump is. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=103.04s)]
*  So yeah, he's got good marketing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=105.12s)]
*  skills and it's so sad that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=107.4s)]
*  the Democrats couldn't even do that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=109.2s)]
*  They can't rise above the lowest [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  bar. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=114.04s)]
*  So I acknowledge all the other [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=114.88s)]
*  politicians are not very good at [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=116.72s)]
*  this either, right? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=118.8s)]
*  But when other politicians think [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=120.84s)]
*  things through, right or wrong, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=122.84s)]
*  right? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=124.92s)]
*  And so they'll come, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=125.44s)]
*  like if they wanted to help Israel [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=126.88s)]
*  steal Gaza, which almost all the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=129.04s)]
*  politicians do, minus Bernie [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  Sanders and a couple of good decent [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=132.96s)]
*  folks, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=135.12s)]
*  So they would come up with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=136.16s)]
*  a sophisticated plan and they would [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=137.68s)]
*  pretend to be doing something else [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=139.8s)]
*  and my God, we couldn't help it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=142.0s)]
*  Hamas made us take all of their [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=143.88s)]
*  land because of human shields, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=145.48s)]
*  blah, blah, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=147.12s)]
*  the usual propaganda. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=147.68s)]
*  Trump is a bit of a buffoon. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=149.0s)]
*  He's like, yeah, that's right, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=150.44s)]
*  why don't we just take it and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=151.88s)]
*  move all of them out and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  then I'll build Trump Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=154.0s)]
*  And then I'll be rich and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=155.24s)]
*  I'll get to, we'll have nice [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=156.6s)]
*  waterfront property there and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=158.2s)]
*  then you guys will, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=159.92s)]
*  the rest of the world will get [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=160.96s)]
*  the party there on the dead corpses [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=162.48s)]
*  of the Palestinian children. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=164.32s)]
*  It'll be great. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=165.92s)]
*  You're not supposed to say that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=167.32s)]
*  Yeah, but who's going to stop him, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=168.72s)]
*  Cenk? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=169.88s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=170.4s)]
*  What was interesting about this is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=171.48s)]
*  what we're talking about earlier in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=173.28s)]
*  the show. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=175.0s)]
*  The left isn't going to stop them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  The left hasn't been able to stop [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=176.88s)]
*  our own guys, Biden, Kamala Harris. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=178.36s)]
*  They were going on the same path, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  not as gross in terms of how they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  put it, but the same path. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  They let Israel slaughter all those [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=185.16s)]
*  people in Gaza and they were going [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=187.08s)]
*  to let them take the land, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=188.96s)]
*  Biden allowed Netanyahu, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=190.8s)]
*  the Israeli government and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=192.4s)]
*  the IDF to basically level Gaza. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=194.28s)]
*  And that's what Donald Trump, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  by the way, keeps talking about, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=198.08s)]
*  how it's uninhabitable. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=200.0s)]
*  Yeah, why do you think it's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=202.4s)]
*  uninhabitable? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=203.44s)]
*  We did that, okay? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=204.36s)]
*  We supplied the bombs that allowed [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  Israel and the IDF to level [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  The whole point was to make it [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  uninhabitable. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=213.16s)]
*  I think the Israeli government was [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=214.52s)]
*  pretty clear about that from [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=216.32s)]
*  the very beginning, okay? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  So to add insult to injury, Trump's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  like, you can't live in, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=221.88s)]
*  no one can live in Gaza. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=223.8s)]
*  So we're going to ethnically [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  cleanse that area and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=228.52s)]
*  then build a resort town that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=230.28s)]
*  I can profit off of. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=231.84s)]
*  Yeah, so guys, so [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=232.96s)]
*  we know this part. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=234.28s)]
*  The interesting part, I think, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=236.96s)]
*  is something else, which I'm going [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=238.4s)]
*  to get to in one sec. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=239.96s)]
*  But just to finish the thought [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=241.32s)]
*  here, so Trump makes it more [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=242.56s)]
*  obscene, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=243.88s)]
*  But is he going to listen [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=245.76s)]
*  to the left? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  He never listens to the left on [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=247.52s)]
*  anything, and the left couldn't get [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=248.72s)]
*  its own leaders to do anything. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=250.48s)]
*  So I wish the left was super [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=252.28s)]
*  powerful and could get him [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=253.68s)]
*  to change, but in this situation, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=255.04s)]
*  we can't. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=256.84s)]
*  The only thing that can get him to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=257.44s)]
*  do is his own base. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=258.96s)]
*  So how is his base reacting to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=260.56s)]
*  this? And in the past, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=262.0s)]
*  they would have been like, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=263.0s)]
*  the first term, yes, sir, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=264.4s)]
*  absolutely, sir, how high, sir, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=265.76s)]
*  right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=267.56s)]
*  In this case, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=268.23999999999995s)]
*  they're not doing that, so [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=268.91999999999996s)]
*  they had a mixed bag. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=270.35999999999996s)]
*  So he said, hey, let's put ground [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  troops in Gaza and make sure [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  the bombs explode on us instead of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  Israeli soldiers. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  And there was a massive pushback [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  from MAGA going, no, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  we're not putting troops on [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=282.76s)]
*  the ground in Gaza. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  That's freaking nuts. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=285.52s)]
*  You want to turn it into a Riviera? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=287.08s)]
*  You want to kill more Palestinians? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=288.4s)]
*  I guess, I don't really care, but [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  we're not putting ground troops in, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=291.23999999999995s)]
*  right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=292.96s)]
*  So he backpedaled out of that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=293.44s)]
*  within 24 hours. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=294.84s)]
*  So now he puts this up, super [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  curious to see what happens. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  All of a sudden, MAGA is like, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=299.56s)]
*  this is gross, man, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  what are you doing? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  Not only do we not want [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=303.2s)]
*  the ground troops, not only do we [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  not want to keep spending money [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  there, but this is actively gross. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=308.56s)]
*  And I gotta be honest with you, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  I was shocked by that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  And if you're on the right and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  you're a Trump voter and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=317.24s)]
*  you're pissed at me for being [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  shocked that you would care about [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  the Palestinians, go ahead and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=321.64s)]
*  get pissed, you have a right to be [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=323.18s)]
*  pissed. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, you don't because in the past [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=325.12s)]
*  you've never shown that you cared [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=326.35999999999996s)]
*  about the Palestinians. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  But now all of a sudden, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=328.44s)]
*  who's it, Ian Miles Chung? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=330.0s)]
*  No, don't cite him. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=332.44s)]
*  No, but my point is, really [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=333.88s)]
*  right wing characters, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=336.08s)]
*  not anywhere near the middle, okay? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=338.08s)]
*  And not just him, tons of them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  And even on Fox News, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=344.32s)]
*  they're talking about how the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=345.96s)]
*  majority of MAGA, and not even [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=347.8s)]
*  Trump voters independence, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=349.8s)]
*  the majority of MAGA was like, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=351.64s)]
*  what the hell is this stupid video? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=353.44s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=355.8s)]
*  We don't want to go to Gaza. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=357.08s)]
*  We don't want to build a Riviera [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=359.08s)]
*  there. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=360.4s)]
*  And for the first time in my life, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=361.0s)]
*  they're saying, by the way, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=362.4s)]
*  we're getting a little tired of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=363.64s)]
*  killing all these people. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=364.96s)]
*  Why are we constantly paying to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=366.72s)]
*  kill what at this point appear to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=368.56s)]
*  be innocent people? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=370.48s)]
*  And they're starting to snap out [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=372.04s)]
*  of the propaganda about how [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=373.68s)]
*  Israel is our special ally, and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=375.04s)]
*  all the Muslims are dirty terrorists. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=376.68s)]
*  They're beginning to see for [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  the first time, wait, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=379.92s)]
*  maybe the Muslims aren't the bad [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  guys. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=382.92s)]
*  We've been constantly invading [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=384.0s)]
*  them, Israel's been taking their [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=385.48s)]
*  land, occupying them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=387.12s)]
*  My God, have we been, I mean, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  this is just the beginning, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  this is just the beginning. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  But I've seen for [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  the first time something I thought [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=397.36s)]
*  was impossible. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  Right wing voters saying, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=400.56s)]
*  have we been unfair to Muslims? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  Okay, just tiny amount, tiny, but [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=404.2s)]
*  I'll take it, it's a good start. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=406.52s)]
*  But they hated this video. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=408.96s)]
*  I think people like Dave Smith, and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=410.04s)]
*  I disagree with Dave Smith on [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=411.96s)]
*  a lot of things, okay? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=413.52s)]
*  But I give him a lot of credit on [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=415.16s)]
*  what he has to say about this [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=417.04s)]
*  particular issue. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=418.68s)]
*  And he's got obviously a massive [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=420.16s)]
*  libertarian audience, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=422.2s)]
*  some of whom are right wing as well. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=423.84s)]
*  And they trust him, and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=426.76s)]
*  he's very knowledgeable on this [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=428.32s)]
*  issue, and he's showing them [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=430.44s)]
*  the receipts. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=432.32s)]
*  He's talking about it in detail, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=433.2s)]
*  in depth. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=435.2s)]
*  And so I really do respect him for [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  his position on this issue and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=438.28s)]
*  taking time on his show regularly [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=440.4s)]
*  to inform people about what's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  actually going on in Gaza. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=444.96s)]
*  I'll just quick double down. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=447.52s)]
*  Along, I would argue, and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  this is the obnoxious part, but [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=451.0s)]
*  along with us two, I would dare [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=452.56s)]
*  say, Dave Smith is the best in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=454.08s)]
*  the business on this issue. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=455.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's pretty good. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=457.24s)]
*  He's perfect on this issue. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=457.84s)]
*  And he's affecting a lot of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=459.68s)]
*  right wingers and libertarians [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=460.84s)]
*  and what he's saying is inarguable. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=462.56s)]
*  How is it America first to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=464.48s)]
*  constantly serve Israel, etc, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=466.04s)]
*  etc? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=468.12s)]
*  Now, interestingly enough, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=469.36s)]
*  the White House Deputy Press [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=471.59999999999997s)]

*  NBC News reached out and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=478.36s)]
*  wanted to know, hey, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=479.48s)]
*  this AI generated video is getting [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=480.64s)]
*  a lot of attention. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=482.32s)]
*  Does the White House have anything [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=483.44s)]
*  to say about it? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=484.8s)]
*  Here's what Anna Kelly said. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=485.56s)]
*  As President Trump has said, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=487.36s)]
*  Gaza in its current state is [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=488.88s)]
*  uninhabitable for [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=490.44s)]
*  any human being. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=491.64s)]
*  President Trump is a visionary and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=493.4s)]
*  his plan to have the United States [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=495.4s)]
*  involved in Gaza's rebuilding will [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=497.48s)]
*  allow for Palestinians to resettle [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=499.72s)]
*  in new beautiful communities while [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=501.88s)]
*  improving conditions in the region [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  for generations to come. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=505.8s)]
*  Now, let me be clear. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=507.08s)]
*  The reason why I wanted to read [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=508.8s)]
*  that statement to you is because [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=509.96s)]
*  the White House is still [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=511.36s)]
*  reiterating that the United States [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=512.6s)]
*  will be responsible for building [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=514.64s)]
*  this Riviera resort situation on [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=516.48s)]
*  stolen land. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=518.44s)]
*  But I also wanted to clarify that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=519.28s)]
*  last part of her statement because [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=521.56s)]
*  make no mistake about it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  They want to push Palestinians out [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=526.28s)]
*  They're not going to be living in [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=527.7199999999999s)]
*  this beautiful resort town that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=529.24s)]
*  they're promising here. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=530.76s)]
*  They'd be living in tents in [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=532.24s)]
*  the desert in the Sinai Peninsula [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=533.56s)]
*  or perhaps in Jordan. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=535.24s)]
*  So the idea is let's push 2 million [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=536.92s)]
*  people out into the desert where [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=539.52s)]
*  they will live terrible lives for [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=542.0s)]
*  the rest of their lives. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=544.48s)]
*  And we'll kill a ton of them on [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=546.16s)]
*  the way out so that the rest of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=548.04s)]
*  the rich people in the world, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=550.2s)]
*  not regular people, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=552.0s)]
*  the richest people in the world [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=553.12s)]
*  can go steal their land. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, Israel would own it, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=556.12s)]
*  of course, and they would make [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=557.2s)]
*  the profit off of it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=558.32s)]
*  But the rest of us can go party [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=559.36s)]
*  there on their graves. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=561.2s)]
*  Yeah, not interested. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=563.44s)]
*  I would never go there. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=564.52s)]
*  I would never party there. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=565.84s)]
*  But I will say this, as of January [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=567.44s)]
*  25th of this year, more than [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=570.12s)]
*  13,000 children have been killed [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=572.48s)]
*  by the IDF in Gaza, 25,000 injured, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=575.36s)]
*  25,000 hospitalized for [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=578.68s)]
*  malnutrition alone. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=580.56s)]
*  Because of course, there had been [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=583.04s)]
*  a long standing blockade on [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=585.0s)]
*  necessary humanitarian aid into [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=586.48s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  But I just want to remind you all [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  what the Palestinian children have [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=591.28s)]
*  been going through, Palestinians [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=593.52s)]
*  in general, but the children, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=595.76s)]
*  especially, have been going [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=597.68s)]
*  through in Gaza. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=599.36s)]
*  This is one of the videos that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=600.36s)]
*  we've covered on the show previously. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=601.92s)]
*  It's difficult to watch, but [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=604.0s)]
*  it's important for you to know. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  They're being victimized on the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  land that's supposed to belong to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=608.92s)]
*  them, and Donald Trump looks at [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  that and says, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=612.4s)]
*  I'm going to take it for myself. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=613.16s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=614.68s)]
*  Do you want to go to the bridge? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=637.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  Come and take it with you. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  Come on, take it with you. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  Do you love your sister because [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=650.48s)]
*  she carried you? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=651.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=652.48s)]
*  Look at me. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=653.48s)]
*  Goodbye. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=664.88s)]
*  Let's go to Cenk because I can't [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=668.04s)]
*  handle that video. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=669.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=670.56s)]
*  So, look, you should care about [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=671.56s)]
*  all human beings, whether they're [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=674.76s)]
*  Muslim, Jewish or Christian, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=677.8s)]
*  But I don't know that the right [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=681.28s)]
*  wing knows there's a lot of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=682.92s)]
*  Palestinian Christians. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=684.48s)]
*  And the bombs don't care if you're [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=686.48s)]
*  Christian or Muslim, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=688.28s)]
*  they just drop them and people die. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  And they die in the most vicious [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=691.9599999999999s)]
*  ways, burned alive, crushed by [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=693.76s)]
*  concrete, etc. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=695.76s)]
*  And so I keep saying it, pro life [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=697.52s)]
*  folks, are you guys ever going to [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=700.12s)]
*  care over 800 babies dead in the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=702.36s)]
*  war, 15,000 children, 800 babies, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=704.6s)]
*  at a bare minimum. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=707.68s)]
*  And so, I mean, if you're a [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=710.12s)]
*  Christian pro life person, and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=712.52s)]
*  you're paying Israel to do this. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=715.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, our hearts break for [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=718.8s)]
*  the 36 kids killed in Israel in [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=722.36s)]
*  Nearly 15,000 kids on the other [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=723.2s)]
*  side, 36 children in Israel, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=727.0s)]
*  800 babies in Palestine. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=730.44s)]

*  about it is if you think Palestinian [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=736.08s)]
*  lives, Muslim or Christian, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=738.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't really care about them. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=740.5200000000001s)]
*  I only care about Israeli lives. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=743.0s)]
*  The rest of them, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=745.4000000000001s)]
*  just slaughter them away and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=746.6400000000001s)]
*  then we'll build casinos on top of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=748.4000000000001s)]
*  them. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=750.6400000000001s)]
*  And it's beyond disgusting and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=751.48s)]
*  thank you finally to some of our [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=753.76s)]
*  right wing brothers and sisters who [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=755.88s)]
*  begun to realize how gross this is [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=758.48s)]
*  and that we're now morally [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=760.9599999999999s)]
*  culpable for funding that. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=762.8399999999999s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opwc9s1KYyg&t=765.04s)]
