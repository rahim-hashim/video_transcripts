"White House adviser Elon Musk has reportedly signaled he wants to give $100 million to entities that are controlled by President Donald Trump‚Äôs political operation, according to a New York Times report published Tuesday night.

The report ‚Äì from Maggie Haberman and Theodore Schleifer ‚Äì came just hours after Trump and the Tesla CEO appeared outside the White House so the president could promote Tesla vehicles while announcing he was buying at least two of them."

# Elon Musk Discovered A New Way To Bribe Trump and He's Not The Only One Doing It
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A)
*  Well, buying President Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=0.0s)]
*  was clearly a great investment for [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=2.44s)]
*  Elon Musk, which is why you are [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=4.82s)]
*  watching Trump do a White House [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=6.94s)]
*  advertisement for Tesla vehicles. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=9.0s)]
*  But looks like Elon has decided [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=11.44s)]
*  this has been such a great [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=13.42s)]
*  investment that I'm going to double [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=15.0s)]
*  down and buy Trump even further. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=17.28s)]
*  He's doing so by now committing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=19.32s)]
*  another $100 million to Trump's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=22.02s)]
*  political endeavors. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  Although he's doing this a little [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=26.84s)]
*  differently this time around. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  So Musk signaled to Trump's advisors [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=31.0s)]
*  that he wants to invest $100 million [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=33.6s)]
*  into groups controlled by Trump's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=36.699999999999996s)]
*  political operation. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=39.56s)]
*  So he wants to do this instead of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=41.68s)]
*  supporting Trump through Elon's own [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=43.68s)]
*  super PAC, America PAC, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=46.32s)]
*  which is what he utilized in order [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=48.12s)]
*  to support Trump during the past [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=50.44s)]
*  election cycle. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=52.84s)]
*  So this sounds honestly like what [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=54.72s)]
*  California and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  other states have been doing in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=58.24s)]
*  terms of behested payments, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=60.28s)]
*  which sounds wonky and boring. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  But it's not and I really want you [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=64.36s)]
*  guys to know about it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=66.10000000000001s)]
*  Because what it is is essentially [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  rather than bribing a politician [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=69.44s)]
*  through super PACs, which they're [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=71.62s)]
*  not allowed to coordinate with, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=73.62s)]
*  right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=75.48s)]
*  That's the big rule with super PACs. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=75.98s)]
*  You can give unlimited money to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=77.44s)]
*  a super PAC, but the super PAC is [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  not allowed to closely coordinate or [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  coordinate at all with the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=83.4s)]
*  campaigns or with the politician [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=85.08s)]
*  that the super PAC supports. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=87.64s)]
*  When you do the behested payments, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  meaning when donors give the money [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=91.92s)]
*  to a nonprofit that is influenced or [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=94.0s)]
*  controlled by the politician, well, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=96.16s)]
*  the politician can interact and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=98.44s)]
*  coordinate with the nonprofit all [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=100.28s)]
*  they want and plus, this is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=102.16s)]
*  important, the contribution to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  the nonprofit is tax deductible. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  So it sounds like that's what Elon [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  is going to do here, but [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=109.88s)]
*  make no mistake about it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=111.44s)]
*  It's a way of continuing his [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=113.28s)]
*  influence of the Trump [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=114.92s)]
*  administration, but doing so in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=116.30000000000001s)]
*  a way that's even more corrupt, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=118.34s)]
*  less regulated and would give him [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=120.42s)]
*  a sweet little tax deduction. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=122.54s)]
*  So sure enough, the groups that are [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=124.58000000000001s)]
*  leading Trump's outside activities [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=126.78s)]
*  include Make America Great Again, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=129.1s)]
*  Inc., a super PAC, but there's also [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=131.26s)]
*  securing American Greatness, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=133.58s)]
*  a political nonprofit. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=135.66s)]
*  The political nonprofit group is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=138.1s)]
*  not required to disclose its [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=140.02s)]
*  donors. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=141.58s)]
*  So it remains to be seen what Elon [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=142.66s)]
*  Musk is going to funnel the money [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=144.86s)]
*  into, is it going to be nonprofits [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=146.58s)]
*  or is it going to be other super [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  PACs that are associated with [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=149.94s)]
*  Trump? But if it happens to be [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=151.46s)]
*  nonprofits, it's important that you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=152.9s)]
*  guys know the differences between [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=154.66s)]
*  the super PACs and the nonprofits [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=156.3s)]
*  because they do not play by [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=157.86s)]
*  the same rules. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  And I'm going to give you some more [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=160.3s)]
*  insight in that in just a minute, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=161.66s)]
*  John. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=163.02s)]
*  Yeah, so look, as you point out, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=164.22s)]
*  there's a lot of different tricky [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  basic ways that they can do this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  My guess would be at the end of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=170.74s)]
*  the day, he's going to cut a check [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=171.78s)]
*  for $100 million to these groups [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  is what he's going to do. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=174.26s)]
*  And it's just direct funds, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=174.98s)]
*  not that most has to be spent on [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=176.98s)]
*  NGO stuff or whatever and some, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=179.22s)]
*  it's going to be straight up, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=181.38s)]
*  it's a check that's given over in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=183.22s)]
*  place of Trump's money. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  And what makes it so amazing is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=186.94s)]
*  not just the brazenness of it, but [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=188.94s)]
*  the fact that it's the year after [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=191.34s)]
*  a presidential election is a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=193.66s)]
*  reminder that Elon Musk is, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=195.78s)]
*  even after losing a significant [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=197.78s)]
*  chunk of his money over the last [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=199.98s)]
*  year, if he has so much just stupid [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=202.14s)]
*  money, he could spend $300, $400, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=204.54s)]
*  $500 million every single year and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=207.17999999999998s)]
*  it would be like a rounding error [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  on him. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=211.73999999999998s)]
*  If he had the wherewithal and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=212.33999999999997s)]
*  the attention span, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=214.17999999999998s)]
*  which I don't think he does, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  he could get involved in every [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  election, all of them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=219.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean- [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=221.45999999999998s)]
*  All the Congress, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  every judicial, every state, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=223.45999999999998s)]
*  he could do that and it wouldn't. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=225.22s)]
*  And the payoff would be 100 times [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  over. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=229.7s)]
*  And so, I hope that this serves as [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=230.78s)]
*  a wake up call, it's clearly not [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=232.58s)]
*  going to be to the Republican [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=234.42s)]
*  politicians that have allowed their [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=235.94s)]
*  party to be utterly bought out, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=237.9s)]
*  not just by the elites or [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=239.74s)]
*  the rich and the abstract, but [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=241.18s)]
*  literally just one specific rich [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=243.1s)]
*  person has purchased their whole [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=244.98s)]
*  party and is now exercising the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=246.9s)]
*  power that you would if you owned [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=248.7s)]
*  it when they don't vote the way [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=250.5s)]
*  that he wants an unelected person. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=252.34s)]
*  He can just threaten, yeah, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm just going to primary you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=255.98s)]
*  And they know that he means it and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=257.3s)]
*  but I hope that at least maybe to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  independence, they wake up and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  think, I always knew that it was [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=262.82s)]
*  bad that the rich control all of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  this, but this one clearly deranged [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=266.74s)]
*  billionaire having such control, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  something has to be done. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=271.06s)]
*  If this doesn't trigger, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=272.66s)]
*  then I don't know what would. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=273.86s)]
*  Yeah, and obviously, and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=275.38s)]
*  I know you agree with this, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=276.94s)]
*  it goes well beyond the influence [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=278.54s)]
*  of Elon Musk specifically, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=280.42s)]
*  It's a broken system that really [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  does undermine the voice of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  the people, and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=286.38s)]
*  the voice of the people, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=287.5s)]
*  with an exception though, right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=289.06s)]
*  So, you mentioned the politicians [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=290.94s)]
*  who are going to see this activity, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=293.26s)]
*  see the kind of influence someone [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=295.73999999999995s)]
*  like Elon Musk has, and they're not [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=298.14s)]
*  going to want to cross him because [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  he could also use that money to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=302.74s)]
*  crush them, and he has made those [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=304.62s)]
*  threats by the way. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=306.7s)]
*  But something happened yesterday [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=307.94s)]
*  that we talked about on the show [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=309.5s)]
*  that I think should kind of inform [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  some of these politicians moving [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=312.78s)]
*  forward if they're actually [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=314.5s)]
*  public servants who look out for [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=316.06s)]
*  the best interests of their [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=317.66s)]
*  constituents as opposed to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=319.1s)]
*  a billionaire like Elon Musk. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=320.46s)]
*  Trump was going after Republican [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=322.06s)]
*  Congressman Thomas Massey because [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=324.14s)]
*  Thomas Massey said, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=326.34s)]
*  I'm not going to vote for [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=327.62s)]
*  this government funding bill. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=328.94s)]
*  I don't agree with it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=330.9s)]
*  I'm a deficit hawk. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=332.1s)]
*  This is not doing enough to cut [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=333.3s)]
*  the deficit. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=334.78s)]
*  I'm not going to vote yes. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=335.38s)]
*  Trump lost his mind about it, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=336.98s)]
*  goes on social media, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=338.74s)]
*  threatens to primary him. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=340.1s)]
*  And overwhelmingly online, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=341.78s)]
*  everyone was supportive of Massey [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=344.97999999999996s)]
*  over Trump. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  Now, why is that? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=347.74s)]
*  Even knowing that Donald Trump is [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=349.18s)]
*  beloved among Republican voters. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=351.06s)]
*  Well, it's because Massey is [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  actually sincere, authentic, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=355.29999999999995s)]
*  has principles. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=357.7s)]
*  I don't necessarily agree with [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  those principles. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=360.41999999999996s)]
*  I have different political views [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=361.14s)]
*  entirely, but that doesn't matter. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  What matters is that he can't be [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=363.85999999999996s)]
*  bought and he's doing what he's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=365.74s)]
*  doing because he actually believes [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=367.5s)]
*  in what he's doing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=369.38s)]
*  He has values and principles that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=370.62s)]
*  the way he behaves as a member of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=372.94s)]
*  Congress. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=374.85999999999996s)]
*  And that's something that is [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=375.62s)]
*  valued by the people. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  So you can have Elon Musk go after [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=378.62s)]
*  him, you can have Trump go after [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=380.5s)]
*  him. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=382.46s)]
*  But the reason why the people are [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=383.02s)]
*  on his side is because they feel [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=384.7s)]
*  that he has delivered for him. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=386.38s)]
*  And I'm specifically talking about [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  his constituents. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=389.78s)]
*  So I say that because if you [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=390.78s)]
*  actually want to be an effective [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=392.29999999999995s)]
*  politician, that could be way [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=394.17999999999995s)]
*  better for your political [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=396.06s)]
*  aspirations than just being a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=397.62s)]
*  puppet for billionaire donors. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=399.62s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=401.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=403.14s)]
*  But they like the easy way. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=403.66s)]
*  So I'm sure they'll opt for [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=404.94s)]
*  the billionaire donors. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=406.90000000000003s)]
*  So the other thing I want to just [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=408.54s)]
*  quickly say before we wrap this up [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=410.62s)]
*  is, well, basically, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=412.90000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk could be doing this to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=414.90000000000003s)]
*  enhance his image among some of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=417.3s)]
*  Trump's officials, cabinet [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=419.66s)]
*  officials, namely who have kind of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=421.74s)]
*  soured on Elon Musk. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=423.94s)]
*  As the Times puts it, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=425.26s)]
*  Musk has been viewed by some Trump [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=426.54s)]
*  officials, including by members of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=428.5s)]
*  Trump's cabinet, as pursuing his [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=430.66s)]
*  own agenda without properly [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=432.74s)]
*  consulting the rest of the Trump [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=434.58s)]
*  administration. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=436.66s)]
*  Musk pointedly backing some of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=437.82s)]
*  Trump's longer standing loyal [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=440.02s)]
*  groups rather than solely his own [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=442.26s)]
*  could help soothe these tensions or [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=444.62s)]
*  those tensions. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=447.14s)]
*  But guys, I really want you to be [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=448.58s)]
*  informed about these behested [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=450.66s)]
*  payments because again, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=452.66s)]
*  oftentimes we talk about money in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=454.18s)]
*  politics and the corrupting [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=456.02s)]
*  influence it has on our politicians. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=457.66s)]
*  We talk about direct campaign [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=459.74s)]
*  donations or donations to super [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=461.66s)]
*  PACs, which are bad, right? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=463.82s)]
*  I mean, unless we're talking about [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=466.06s)]
*  small dollar donors. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=467.62s)]
*  But when it comes to behested [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=468.58s)]
*  payments, it's literally unlimited [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=470.02s)]
*  amounts of money, less regulation. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=471.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's even more corrupt than [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=473.66s)]
*  what we have with super PACs. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=476.02s)]
*  I wrote about it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=478.38s)]
*  I highly recommend you read it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=479.22s)]
*  It's not behind a paywall. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=481.14s)]
*  The title of the piece I wrote on [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=482.90000000000003s)]
*  this is when brazen corruption is [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=484.5s)]
*  rebranded as charitable giving. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=486.38s)]
*  A few excerpts, you have Governor [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=488.46000000000004s)]
*  Gavin Newsom who directed more than [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=491.1s)]
*  $226.5 million in behested payments, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=493.94s)]
*  meaning he solicited these [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=497.02000000000004s)]
*  donations in 2020 alone when COVID [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=499.06s)]
*  emerged reportedly. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=501.74s)]
*  He also raised $13.85 million from [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=503.5s)]
*  the practice in 2024, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=506.34000000000003s)]
*  including $450,000 from Goldman [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=508.3s)]
*  Sachs philanthropy fund, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=511.22s)]
*  $250,000 from fidelity investments, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=513.46s)]
*  $250,000 from gift fund, and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=516.66s)]
*  $25,000 from, that's a typo, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=519.54s)]
*  from CVS Pharmacy, Inc. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=522.84s)]
*  So again, loosely regulated, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=525.78s)]
*  they, for instance, super PACs [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=528.1s)]
*  allow you to donate unlimited [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=530.62s)]
*  amounts if you're a billionaire [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=532.9s)]
*  donor, but that super PAC cannot [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=535.38s)]
*  coordinate with the politician. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=537.82s)]
*  When it comes to the nonprofits, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=540.74s)]
*  they can coordinate all they want. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=542.46s)]
*  In fact, the politician, him or [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=544.0600000000001s)]
*  the nonprofit, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=545.9000000000001s)]
*  that's how messed up this is. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=546.74s)]
*  And by the way, charitable [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=549.0200000000001s)]
*  foundations that receive behested [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=550.5s)]
*  payments can and do coordinate [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=552.5s)]
*  closely with the office holders and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=554.1s)]
*  the donations are tax deductible. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=555.94s)]
*  I say charitable because that's [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=557.86s)]
*  what nonprofits are concerned with. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=559.46s)]
*  They're considered charitable [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=561.34s)]
*  foundations, but oftentimes in [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=563.46s)]
*  the case of behested payments, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=565.6600000000001s)]
*  it's really about influencing [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=567.74s)]
*  the politicians in a less regulated [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=569.8000000000001s)]
*  way, and that's a concern. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=572.1800000000001s)]
*  That's a concern. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=574.18s)]
*  It's an underreported story, and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=574.98s)]
*  I think if this is going on in your [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=576.66s)]
*  state, you should be aware of it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=578.34s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=580.66s)]
*  an angel gets his swings. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=582.22s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xZ3F5Lyh-A&t=583.74s)]
