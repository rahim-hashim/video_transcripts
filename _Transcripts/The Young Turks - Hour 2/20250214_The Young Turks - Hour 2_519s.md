The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Bill Burr: The TRUTH About Billionaires
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc)
*  These billionaires, they need to be put down like rabid dogs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=0.0s)]
*  They like rabid with greed and just going out and just dividing everybody. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Bill Burr made monocles fly this week with his comments on billionaires on his podcast. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=15.52s)]
*  While responding to a comment from a listener during a segment on women's sports, one listener [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=21.28s)]
*  wrote that they don't have time to watch sports because they're struggling to raise their [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=26.32s)]
*  two kids and they can barely make ends meet. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=29.98s)]
*  That set Burr off. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=34.06s)]
*  The amount of people that are struggling out there because of these billionaires, and they [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=35.06s)]
*  got us all arguing liberal and conservative. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=39.78s)]
*  We gotta stop doing that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=44.7s)]
*  I'm so tired of hearing about people going to bed worried about what's gonna happen next [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=46.18s)]
*  week. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=55.540000000000006s)]
*  Money in this country. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=56.78s)]
*  And there's so much work being done. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=60.54s)]
*  Then if you work a full week at a job, you should be able to pay your rent. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=64.1s)]
*  You shouldn't have to go out and get another job and still be struggling. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=71.34s)]
*  It's bad for the country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=76.66s)]
*  Because then the kids don't see their parents and they're not getting the upbringing that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=79.22s)]
*  they need. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  At least these billionaires, they need to be put down like rabid dogs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=85.86s)]
*  And he didn't stop there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  He also called out Donald Trump's hollow overtures like renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=96.02000000000001s)]
*  of America despite campaigning on addressing people's material conditions, the cost of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=101.9s)]
*  living, the price of groceries. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=105.62s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=107.86000000000001s)]
*  What's the f***ing epitome of this time right now? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=109.1s)]
*  How divisive we are that the Gulf of Mexico is now called the Gulf of America and people [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=112.3s)]
*  get excited. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=118.94s)]
*  How the f*** does that help your wallet? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=119.94s)]
*  It's an empty gesture and then it's also a racist gesture. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=121.94s)]
*  That's the white guy under, that's him saying f***ing Mexicans without saying it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=126.74s)]
*  Who has a f***ing problem with Mexicans? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=132.46s)]
*  What is the real problem? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=135.06s)]
*  So, Burr 2028? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=137.22s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=139.3s)]
*  So I'm gonna be, what is it, stick in the mud? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=141.26s)]
*  So I know he's a comic and I love Bill Burr, but don't say put down anyone, okay? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=144.46s)]
*  So billionaires need to be put down like rabid dogs. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=149.5s)]
*  No, don't, don't, don't, don't. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=152.3s)]
*  Okay, I know I'm the bad guy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=153.98s)]
*  Boo, he's funny and stuff. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=155.7s)]
*  I get it, I get it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=157.18s)]
*  But at the same time, if you're in the establishment and you're these billionaires, when you got [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=158.94s)]
*  one of the top comics in the country who is beloved talking about putting all of you down [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=164.9s)]
*  and the crowd goes nuts. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=171.82s)]
*  You might wanna check yourself a little bit. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=174.38s)]
*  You guys are out of control. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  They don't realize how much they're abusing the American people. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=179.66s)]
*  And what's Trump gonna do? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=182.7s)]
*  He campaigned as a populist, now he brought in Elon Musk to run domestic policy and Mary [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=183.7s)]
*  Maddison to run foreign policy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=188.66s)]
*  Those are his two out of the top three donors. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=190.66s)]
*  Timothy Mellon, who's this number two donor, has gotta be thinking what the hell? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=193.22s)]
*  Which part of the government do I get to run, right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=198.22s)]
*  Because these guys are literally giving hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=200.26000000000002s)]
*  And then on the Democratic side, Kamala Harris raised even more money than Donald Trump, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=202.9s)]
*  okay? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  Tons of money from billionaires, tons of money from corporate interests, etc. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  And they keep squeezing and squeezing the American middle class and Bill's right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  Then you gotta go work two jobs and it's still not enough. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=215.82s)]
*  Why, guys, when you think the system is rigged, it is rigged. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=219.06s)]
*  Who do you think rigged it? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=221.94s)]
*  The immigrant that came in without a single dollar in his pocket, how the hell is he gonna [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=223.26s)]
*  rig anything, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=227.26s)]
*  No, it's the guys up top, the guys up top. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=228.54s)]
*  So about the overall point, Bill Borg is 100% right. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=231.28s)]
*  And you're not going to be able to contain the anger the next time there's a robbery. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=235.66s)]
*  And there's gonna be one. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=240.86s)]
*  It's because the billionaires rob us every frick in time, whether it's a Democrat or [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=242.9s)]
*  Republican in office. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=247.78s)]
*  And now they're totally in charge, we did that earlier in the show, half of Trump's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=249.3s)]
*  cabinet's billionaires. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=252.70000000000002s)]
*  And what's their top priority? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=254.34s)]
*  You're gonna be shocked to find out, tax cuts for the rich, of course. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=255.34s)]
*  They're trying to cancel Bill Burr. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=261.88s)]
*  I did a video about this on Rebel HQ, I think it's called, right wingers try to cancel Bill [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=263.38s)]
*  Burr and humiliate themselves instead. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=268.54s)]
*  Like, Elon Musk is their god king. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=272.62s)]
*  And Elon Musk said, comedy is dead because the left killed it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=275.94s)]
*  And the minute Bill Burr says something, he said something about the California fires [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=281.5s)]
*  where he made a joke about how everybody chimes in saying, I know how to run a fire in a mayor, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=285.3s)]
*  like Mel Gibson. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=292.46s)]
*  I know how to be a fireman and how to be the mayor and how to, just armchair D bags chime [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=293.46s)]
*  in and say that stuff. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=299.06s)]
*  And he points out that that is ridiculous. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=300.06s)]
*  And just that offhanded statement to Jimmy Kimmel on a panel, they want to cancel Bill [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=302.9s)]
*  Burr, they gave away the game. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=309.5s)]
*  They are annoying now, they're the annoying ones now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=312.1s)]
*  We were the annoying ones on the left for a second, because we were like, you said that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=314.58s)]
*  word wrong, we were annoying, I get it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=318.14s)]
*  But now they're the annoying ones. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=321.08s)]
*  Patrick, there's a reason I say that previously on the show that Vinny's a moron. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  Vinny thought himself- [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=328.7s)]
*  He can't get over this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=329.7s)]
*  Well, he was in the video about Bill Burr because he did the monologue, it is the most [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=330.7s)]
*  hilariously dumb monologue I've ever seen. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=336.26s)]
*  And in it, he's like, I can't believe that Bill Burr, he's against insurance companies. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=339.34s)]
*  It's like, bro, now you're on the side of the insurance companies, no one likes insurance [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  companies. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=351.38s)]
*  You guys are so against the free speech that you said you were for, that now you're, because [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=352.38s)]
*  he said a joke that got in your fee fees, now you're trying to cancel his free speech [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=358.78s)]
*  as a comedian. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=364.54s)]
*  And I hate to break it, and he even says, I can't believe that one of the top comedians [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=365.54s)]
*  is doing this now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=368.98s)]
*  No, he's still the top comedian because he's still doing the funny thing, which is pointing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=369.98s)]
*  out what's ridiculous. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=373.26s)]
*  You're not funny anymore. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=374.98s)]
*  You're the annoying one who's like, you can't tell a joke anymore because you went against [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=377.06s)]
*  my political philosophy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=381.7s)]
*  And they're the ones who will go to comedy shows and instead of laughing will clap. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=384.22s)]
*  Bill Burr still has people laughing at the comedy show because laughing is an involuntary [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=388.54s)]
*  response to something funny when you go to a good comedian. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=392.62s)]
*  And clapping is what you do when they didn't say something funny, but you want it known [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=396.0s)]
*  that I'm on the side of these right wing meanies. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so look, Brett's 100% right about complaining about comics. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=403.02s)]
*  It means you're losing, right? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=410.34s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=411.94s)]
*  So he apparently defended the LA response or whatever. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=412.94s)]
*  I think Karen Bass sucks. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=416.46s)]
*  I think her response was awful. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=418.82s)]
*  So I don't agree with Bill Burr. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=420.7s)]
*  So what? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=422.06s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=423.18s)]
*  Bill Burr is a comic, let him say whatever the hell he wants. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=424.53999999999996s)]
*  What are you getting, catching feelings over that? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=426.62s)]
*  And now that's a political, so are you crazy? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=429.5s)]
*  Isn't not Joffrey tormenting the jester in Game of Thrones? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=432.7s)]
*  Like that's it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=437.78000000000003s)]
*  He's the jester, you don't shoot the jester moron. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=438.78000000000003s)]
*  So John Stewart Bill Burr, 2028. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=441.18s)]
*  I'm fine with that, yeah. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=445.58s)]
*  I hear what you're saying. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=446.58s)]
*  Yes, he's a comedian, you still don't want to encourage it, but it feels like one of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=448.62s)]
*  those situations that wouldn't necessarily be said. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=453.5s)]
*  No, don't do it, don't do it, man. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=456.46s)]
*  I would struggle to find any empathy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=460.06s)]
*  Like you're an extremist, Jordan. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=462.62s)]
*  We know that you're an extremist and honestly, I'm glad we entrapped you into admitting it [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=464.62s)]
*  because the police will be seeing you out soon. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=468.66s)]
*  I don't think we should kill people, like I'm against killing people and that goes for [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=470.74s)]
*  assassins and insurance companies. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=476.38s)]
*  Yeah, no, under no circumstances, violence is never the right answer. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=477.82s)]
*  But he's a comic, he's joking, okay? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=482.62s)]
*  So I'm not gonna cancel him over jokes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=484.98s)]
*  I like that we're the cool ones again. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=487.38s)]
*  It happens for a second, let's see how it goes. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=489.02s)]
*  Let's see if we can keep it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlP7uwIVmQc&t=492.18s)]
