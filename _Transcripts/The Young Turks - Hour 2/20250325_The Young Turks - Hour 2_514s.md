TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Jasmine Crockett Tries To Backpedal After Firestorm For Greg Abbott Insult
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E)
*  We in these hot ass Texas streets, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=0.0s)]
*  honey. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=2.42s)]
*  Y'all know we got Governor Hot [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=3.08s)]
*  Wheels down there, come on now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=5.18s)]
*  And the only thing hot about him [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=7.44s)]
*  is that he is a hot ass mess, honey. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=9.8s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=12.52s)]
*  Crockett has ignited a firestorm of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=15.16s)]
*  backlash after referring to Texas [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=17.52s)]
*  Governor Greg Abbott as Governor [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=19.88s)]
*  Hot Wheels, which was a reference [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=22.2s)]
*  to the fact that he was a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=24.44s)]
*  Democratic Democrat. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=25.84s)]
*  Which was a reference to the fact [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=27.64s)]
*  that he uses a wheelchair, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=29.32s)]
*  although she now denies that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  We'll get to her denial in just [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=33.24s)]
*  a minute. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=34.28s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  I know the denial is even worse, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=35.32s)]
*  believe me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=36.68s)]
*  Okay, we'll get to that just a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=37.44s)]
*  second. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  But ironically, she did make that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  remark at the awards dinner for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  the human rights campaign. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=43.08s)]
*  This took place on Saturday, but [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=45.16s)]
*  it's going viral today. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=47.0s)]
*  Now Abbott, for those who don't [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=48.72s)]
*  know, and to be honest, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=50.28s)]
*  I didn't even know the story behind [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=51.56s)]
*  why he's in a wheelchair. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=53.36s)]
*  But he was actually paralyzed back [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=54.84s)]
*  in 1984. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=56.92s)]
*  He was on a jog and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=57.52s)]
*  an oak tree fell on him and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=58.96s)]
*  paralyzed him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=60.96s)]
*  Now, you should also know the part [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=62.2s)]
*  of the story where he effectively [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=64.56s)]
*  sued the tree company behind [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=66.88000000000001s)]
*  the tree and now has these insane [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=68.92s)]
*  payments every year as a result of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=71.28s)]
*  winning that lawsuit, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=73.76s)]
*  half a million a year. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=75.56s)]
*  I'm not even kidding. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=78.76s)]
*  So hold on, hold on. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  But then he changed the laws in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=81.12s)]
*  the state to make it even more [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=82.4s)]
*  difficult for people who suffer [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  a similar fate from being able to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  sue corporations or companies. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=86.64s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=88.72s)]
*  That's worth mentioning in this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=91.08s)]
*  Yeah, when you cross the bridge, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=92.28s)]
*  you burn it right after. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=93.68s)]
*  That's the Republican way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=94.88s)]
*  So look, I don't know the specifics [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=96.64s)]
*  of that, and I don't begrudge him [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=99.04s)]
*  the money, I mean- [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=101.36s)]
*  No, me either. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=102.52s)]
*  Yeah, he's paralyzed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=103.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=104.84s)]
*  So, but Republicans always say, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=105.6s)]
*  tort reform, tort, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=107.56s)]
*  there's too many losses, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=108.8s)]
*  too many losses. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=110.08s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=110.88s)]
*  what's Trump doing now? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=111.4s)]
*  I'm suing CBS, I'm suing ABC, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=112.12s)]
*  I'm suing everybody. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=113.68s)]
*  I sue, sue, sue, sue, sue, sue, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  what happened? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=116.64s)]
*  They hurt my feelings. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=117.72000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk, no, my feelings were [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=118.68s)]
*  hurt, I was called a thief. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  Sue, sue, sue, sue, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  what happened to tort reform, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=123.56s)]
*  guys? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  So those are legitimate ways to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=126.48s)]
*  criticize Abbot Musk. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  And you don't have to be polite [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  about it, we just did it right now. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=131.88s)]
*  Then there's that about way of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=134.28s)]
*  criticizing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=135.88s)]
*  So I want to actually play that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=136.68s)]
*  video again so everyone can watch [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=138.16s)]
*  it before I get to Jasmine Crockett [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=139.84s)]
*  statements about it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=141.68s)]
*  So just cue that up, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=143.08s)]
*  don't play it yet, cue it up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=143.96s)]
*  Some of the backlash she received [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=145.96s)]
*  came in the form of Republican [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=147.88s)]
*  members of Congress basically [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=149.64s)]
*  trashing her going after her. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=151.44s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene is one of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=153.12s)]
*  them saying absolutely shameful. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=154.44s)]
*  I mean, it's hilarious coming from [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=156.44s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene who has said [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=158.04s)]
*  all sorts of insidious disgusting [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=159.56s)]
*  things about all sorts of people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=161.04s)]
*  But nonetheless, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=162.4s)]
*  absolutely shameful. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=163.4s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett is the face of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=164.28s)]
*  the Democrat Party, and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=165.84s)]
*  they all support her. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=167.12s)]
*  Just let her talk because the ads [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=168.28s)]
*  write themselves and America finds [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=170.36s)]
*  out everything they need to know [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=172.4s)]
*  who the Democrats really are. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=174.2s)]
*  Now, I don't think it was a good [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=176.56s)]
*  idea for Jasmine Crockett to say it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  I thought it was a gross statement. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=180.76s)]
*  I don't think she needed to attack [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  the fact that he's in a wheelchair. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=184.16s)]
*  I think that's a cheap shot. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  And it's a lazy insult. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=187.56s)]
*  It's also demeaning, degrading to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  other disabled people in this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=193.2s)]
*  Abbott is a target rich [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  environment. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=195.48s)]
*  There are substantive ways to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  attack him, political ways to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=198.48s)]
*  attack him without resorting to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=200.28s)]
*  making fun of the fact that he's in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=202.72s)]
*  a wheelchair. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=204.44s)]
*  But nonetheless, when she was [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=205.24s)]
*  reached out to by Politico, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=207.28s)]
*  they asked what's going on here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=209.08s)]
*  Her statement to them was that my [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=212.28s)]
*  statement speaks for itself. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=214.44s)]
*  That was the initial response from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=217.44s)]
*  her, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=219.4s)]
*  But now she's realizing, okay, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  maybe there are some Democrats who [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=222.4s)]
*  are uncomfortable with this as well. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=224.0s)]
*  So she released another statement. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=225.56s)]
*  I'm going to read it verbatim. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=227.4s)]
*  I wasn't thinking about [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=229.36s)]
*  the governor's condition. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  I was thinking about the planes, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=231.56s)]
*  trains, and automobiles he used to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=233.28s)]
*  transfer migrants into communities [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=235.16s)]
*  led by black mayors deliberately [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=237.16s)]
*  stoking tension and fear among [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=239.08s)]
*  the most vulnerable. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=241.0s)]
*  I don't believe that for a second. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=243.84s)]
*  No way. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=245.16s)]
*  You called him Governor Hot Wheels. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=245.76s)]
*  In fact, let's watch it again. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=247.48s)]
*  We in these hot ass Texas streets, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=249.08s)]
*  honey. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  Y'all know we got Governor Hot [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=252.2s)]
*  Wheels down there, come on now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=254.12s)]
*  And the only thing hot wheels [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=256.2s)]
*  on him is that he is a hot ass mess, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=258.04s)]
*  honey. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=260.48s)]
*  In regard to the hot ass mess [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=261.16s)]
*  statement, she says literally the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=262.8s)]
*  next line I said was he was a hot [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=264.88s)]
*  ass mess referencing his terrible [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=266.64000000000004s)]
*  policies. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=268.68s)]
*  At no point did I mention or [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=269.24s)]
*  allude to his condition. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  But what does Hot Wheels mean, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=273.0s)]
*  Jasmine? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=275.64000000000004s)]
*  I can't stand the denials. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  I can't stand, just own it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=278.88s)]
*  You said it, own it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=280.68s)]
*  If you think it was a bad idea, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  then you're going to have to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=283.76s)]
*  change the rules. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=285.0s)]
*  Own it, if you think it was [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=286.36s)]
*  a bad idea now that you're getting [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=287.56s)]
*  backlash, just apologize for it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=289.04s)]
*  And everyone's going to forget and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=290.84s)]
*  move on. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=291.8s)]
*  Why can't we just make it simple? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=292.32s)]
*  Yeah, so look, I've said in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=294.12s)]
*  the past, I like her aggressive [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=295.32s)]
*  attitude. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=296.6s)]
*  We need a lot more than [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=297.12s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=298.12s)]
*  I like when she says things like [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=299.72s)]
*  hot ass, like people in the past. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=301.12s)]
*  I was like, that's not civil, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=302.56s)]
*  don't do that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=303.84s)]
*  No, no, do that, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=304.8s)]
*  But this one obviously crossed [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=307.0s)]
*  the line. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=309.2s)]
*  And my guess is part of the reason [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=310.36s)]
*  why she's backpedaling is because [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=312.76s)]
*  some people on the left were like, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=315.12s)]
*  that's not cool. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=317.2s)]
*  100%. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=318.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=318.8s)]
*  That's why you don't attack them on [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=319.32s)]
*  being disabled, that's weird. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=321.44s)]
*  And for those Democrats who do [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=323.12s)]
*  exist, thank you because I felt [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  super blackpilled by this story as [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=326.84s)]
*  I saw people who didn't hesitate to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=329.0s)]
*  jump down my throat over [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=331.24s)]
*  the slightest issue, okay? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  Not even close to anything like [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=334.88s)]
*  this, defending her for this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=336.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=338.4s)]
*  Today, I was just like, it's okay [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  to make fun of disabled people now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=341.08s)]
*  Okay, if the disabled person is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=343.72s)]
*  someone we don't like because of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=345.04s)]
*  their politics, I guess we could [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  say whatever we want to them. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=347.52s)]
*  So are you going to now call [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=348.8s)]
*  Candace Owens the N-word? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=350.88s)]
*  Is that okay? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  It's just dumb. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  You have to be consistent on these [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=354.44s)]
*  things. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=356.32s)]
*  If you respect people who have [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=356.92s)]
*  disabilities and you want to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=358.68s)]
*  protect them from this kind of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  gross language, then you have to be [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  consistent regardless of who's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=363.72s)]
*  being targeted or attacked. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=365.48s)]
*  And so we defended Jasmine Cronkite [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=367.2s)]
*  yesterday, today on this take down [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=369.24s)]
*  Elon Musk thing and we said, no, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=371.4s)]
*  in that statement, she clearly [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=373.44s)]
*  said she's not calling for violence, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=375.08s)]
*  nobody should do violence. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=377.0s)]
*  We defended her on all these [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=378.44s)]
*  defaults attacks from the right [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=379.84s)]
*  wing, but again, you've got to be [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=381.48s)]
*  principled and honest. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=383.24s)]
*  And so, the so-called explanation [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=384.64s)]
*  actually bothers me more. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=387.16s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=389.32s)]
*  There's no way that she meant [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=390.0s)]
*  the bus thing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=391.64s)]
*  And look, I know some of you [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=392.8s)]
*  believe it because it's our side, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=394.28s)]
*  so we're just going to choose to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=396.24s)]
*  believe something that hot wheels [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=397.88s)]
*  when we all know he's in a [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=399.6s)]
*  wheelchair. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=400.96s)]
*  And you thought that everyone would [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=402.0s)]
*  assume that it was the buses or [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=404.44s)]
*  the trains and the planes instead [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=406.52s)]
*  of his wheelchair? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=408.82s)]
*  No one in their right mind who is [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=410.24s)]
*  an obscenely biased believes that, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=412.68s)]
*  right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=415.36s)]
*  So that felt like a politician to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=416.88s)]
*  me and so that bothered me. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=418.88s)]
*  And then, last, this one's tiny, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=420.76s)]
*  but she's like, he bussed him down [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=423.48s)]
*  to cities with black mayors. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=426.12s)]
*  Wait, why is that getting [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=428.6s)]
*  involved now? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=430.24s)]
*  Why is the race of the mayor [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=431.04s)]
*  relevant? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=432.6s)]
*  Because she's trying to defend [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=433.16s)]
*  herself, so she's hiding behind [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  that community. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=436.6s)]
*  Don't do that, don't do that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=437.6s)]
*  Now you're making it racial for [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=440.8s)]
*  no reason, and it's in an attempt [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  to defend yourself when you made [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  the egregious statement in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=446.8s)]
*  the first place. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=448.48s)]
*  I mean, Denver was one of the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=449.6s)]
*  areas that migrants were being [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=451.24s)]
*  bussed to. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1RYXhnqo0E&t=452.96000000000004s)]
