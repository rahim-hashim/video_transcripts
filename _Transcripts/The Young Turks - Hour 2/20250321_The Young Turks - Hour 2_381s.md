# This Could Be The Dumbest Anti-Trans Bill EVER
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA)
*  Republicans are continuing their culture war campaign against the transgender community. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=0.0s)]
*  Now two Republican lawmakers in Arkansas have introduced a bill that targets hairdressers [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=5.04s)]
*  and barbers who give gender non-conforming haircuts to kids. The legislation is called [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=9.68s)]
*  House Bill 1668, known as the Vulnerable Youth Protection Act. Here's the context. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=15.52s)]
*  The Vulnerable Youth Protection Act was introduced by Republican Rep Mary Bentley and Senator Alan [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=21.28s)]
*  Clark. If passed, legislation would allow parents to sue anyone who supports a minor's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=25.68s)]
*  gender transition. And that goes beyond just surgical or medical interventions. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=31.12s)]
*  Like I personally don't think that a minor should be medically transitioning in any sort [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=37.04s)]
*  of irreversible way on account of the undeveloped brains that all minors have. But the bill defines [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=42.56s)]
*  social transitioning as any act in which a minor adopts a gender identity different [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=48.8s)]
*  from their biological sex. And that includes clothing choices, pronouns, hairstyle, name, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=54.16s)]
*  which is insane. Under this definition, a barber, a teacher or a guidance counselor could face [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  lawsuits for supporting a child's gender identity. And that does nothing but make the child's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=67.28s)]
*  mental health even worse. And when going through a difficult time trying to express themselves, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  the punishment, it allows for lawsuits to be filed up to 20 years after an incident. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=81.76s)]
*  I know it says 15 there and I read the actual text of the bill and it says 20 years in the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=87.92s)]
*  actual text. So it's between 15 and 20, I believe it's 20, with damages ranging from $10,000 to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=92.48s)]
*  $10 million in cases where a minor received gender affirming care. But here's the head shot, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=97.2s)]
*  just by the way, randomly gonna show this to you for Rep Mary Bentley who introduced the bill. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  And for the record, she does seem to have a gender nonconforming haircut. That's the exact haircut [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=108.88s)]
*  that I currently have right now and have had for most of my life. So that- [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=114.32s)]
*  Classic. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=118.72s)]
*  Really, yeah, that should be outlawed. She should be prosecuted as should her barber, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=119.28s)]
*  I think, under her own legislation. Arkansas has been a leader in legislative efforts restricting [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=124.72s)]
*  transgender rights. In 2021, it became the first state to ban gender affirming care for minors, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=130.4s)]
*  a law that was struck down by a federal judge in 2023. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=135.52s)]
*  Since then, more than two dozen states have enacted similar measures limiting medical care, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=138.56s)]
*  sports participation, and bathroom access for transgender people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=142.8s)]
*  The bill is still moving through the Arkansas legislature and is expected to face immediate [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=146.96s)]
*  legal challenges if passed into law. Critics argue the bill violates First Amendment rights [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  and is designed to intimidate teachers, doctors, even parents from supporting transgender and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  gender nonconforming youth. The American Civil Liberties Union or ACLU of Arkansas is condemned [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=161.92s)]
*  it as state mandated bullying. I'm curious your thoughts, Mark Thompson. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, I don't get the trans thing from the start being used as a political [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=171.28s)]
*  employ. It's such a horrible, I mean, I understand why it's effective, I mean, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  clearly, but it's such a horrible abuse of a microscopic population compared to the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=181.92s)]
*  general population in America. And the idea that they could, the right couldn't run on it [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=189.68s)]
*  and continue to pound the drum like this is the biggest issue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=195.44s)]
*  Everybody gets up every day and they're just trans people everywhere and they're wanting to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=198.88s)]
*  transition too early and they're wearing this weird haircut, whatever it is. I mean, it's absurd, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=202.56s)]
*  and yet it takes up so much media oxygen and it's been such an effective tool. And as I say, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=207.84s)]
*  it's abusive. I mean, I don't know anything about this trans community in a way that really gives me [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=214.08s)]
*  a perspective, but my heart breaks for those people who are legitimately trying to find themselves [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=219.12s)]
*  in a world that is increasingly so hostile to them. So I really mean it, my heart breaks for them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=225.92s)]
*  So I kind of bring that to this conversation and I just find both the absurdity of it and also the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=232.96s)]
*  cruelty of it, to be honest. I imagine the way the conservatives in America imagine the world is just [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=239.92s)]
*  something out of a South Park episode, like all the DEI planes are crashing, even though that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=246.4s)]
*  started happening in abundance when Trump won. This is the irony is endless, you know what I'm [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=251.68s)]
*  saying? Like some black person flying a plane, it's going down, everybody's trans, everybody's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=256.56s)]
*  like super gay, skipping through the streets with rainbow clothes on. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  And these people, like most of the people who hold these sentiments, like they live in Oklahoma [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=267.44s)]
*  or Idaho and they like never see these things at all. So it's just like if this is such an [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=272.72s)]
*  intricate, well thought, well planned out conspiracy, then why is like half of a percentage [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=279.92s)]
*  point of the population trans? You could just leave these people alone, but then if you did [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  that, you would have to actually talk about real issues like wages and benefits and things like [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  that, which of course these people have no interest in doing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=299.44s)]
*  And that's why you see this all over Fox and all the right wing outlets. I mean, obviously it is a [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=302.88s)]
*  real culture war issue, like people in the streets really are concerned about this to know real, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=307.12s)]
*  doesn't make sense that they are, but they are. But a lot of the reason is because the media that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=314.24s)]
*  they consume won't stop talking about it, because again, if they do stop talking about it, then [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=318.8s)]
*  they'll have to be substantive and they're not interested in that. So. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=323.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think that is true and it is overpushed for the amount of the population it is. I don't [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=326.24s)]
*  think it's necessarily, in my opinion, accurate to say that there's no reason for people to be [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=333.2s)]
*  concerned because I've heard many instances of children at schools where they are being [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=337.12s)]
*  exposed to things at an earlier age and they should ever be exposed to any sort of gender [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=342.56s)]
*  ideology, let alone one side or the other. And so I think we at our peril act as though [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=346.8s)]
*  it never exists. Sometimes it does. We just need to have a common sense middle ground when it comes [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  to these issues where we can respect everybody and find a way that we can land the plane on this, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=357.52s)]
*  so to speak, in a way that we protect people's identity. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  We respect people and we also don't over correct so far that we lose elections forever into the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=368.32s)]
*  future. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBVZMJzyOA&t=378.79999999999995s)]
