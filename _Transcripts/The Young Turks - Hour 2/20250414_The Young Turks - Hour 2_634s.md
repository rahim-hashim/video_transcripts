"US police said Sunday they had arrested a man for alleged arson and "terrorism" after an attack at the official residence of Democratic heavyweight and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.

Shapiro, widely viewed as a potential 2028 presidential contender, was inside with his family when the fire broke out in a different part of the Georgian-style mansion in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, state police said."

# Assailant ARRESTED For Setting Josh Shapiro's Home Ablaze
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo)
*  Another act of political violence in America, you're looking at the burned home of Pennsylvania [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor Josh Shapiro and his family, which was broken into and set ablaze while the family [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=5.92s)]
*  was asleep last night, just hours after they celebrated the Jewish holiday Passover, two [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=10.08s)]
*  nights ago, I'm sorry, hosting guests in the very room you were just looking at, hosting [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=15.4s)]
*  them for the Jewish celebration. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=20.48s)]
*  The very important holiday, Shapiro has become one of the biggest names in the Democratic [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=25.16s)]
*  Party and is widely considered a potential candidate for president in 2028. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=29.04s)]
*  The attacker was arrested on charges of arson, terrorism and attempted murder. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Shapiro said that he and his sleeping family were woken up by a police trooper who banged [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=37.8s)]
*  on our door at around 2am local time and that they were evacuated from the building. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=42.24s)]
*  He said, thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Speaking reporters outside the residence, a broken window blackened by the fire visible [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=51.04s)]
*  behind him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=55.12s)]
*  Shapiro made a forceful appeal for an end to political violence. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=56.12s)]
*  Here is some of his statement. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=59.96s)]
*  But we do know that this attack was targeted. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=61.6s)]
*  We don't know the person's specific motive yet, but we do know a few truths. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=64.64s)]
*  First, this type of violence is not okay. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=71.92s)]
*  This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=82.0s)]
*  And I don't give a damn if it's coming from one particular side or the other. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=86.8s)]
*  Directed at one particular party or another or one particular person or another. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=93.8s)]
*  It is not okay. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=99.36s)]
*  And it has to stop. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=102.08s)]
*  We have to be better than this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=105.1s)]
*  We have a responsibility to all be better. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that was a very powerful statement. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=111.4s)]
*  And then here's a little bit more where he talked about possible motives. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=114.2s)]
*  If this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=117.8s)]
*  I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday for the good people of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=125.6s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=133.12s)]
*  Here's a third truth. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=136.64s)]
*  If he was trying to terrorize our family, our friends, the Jewish community who joined [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=140.76s)]
*  us for a Passover Seder in that room last night. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  Hear me on this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=157.44s)]
*  We celebrated our faith last night proudly. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=159.32s)]
*  And in a few hours we will celebrate our second Seder of Passover again proudly. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=162.6s)]
*  No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=169.28s)]
*  Yeah beautiful statement, very powerful. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=180.24s)]
*  And they indeed did have a beautiful second night of Passover Seder in their home. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=182.88s)]
*  Terrorists motives be damned. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=187.96s)]
*  And just a personal note, these are people, these are people's families and that's why [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=189.64s)]
*  political violence must always be just outright condemned. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=194.44s)]
*  It just so happens that I'm friends with the governor's daughter and thankfully she and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=197.6s)]
*  all of them are okay. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=204.56s)]
*  But you don't think when people are in the news in front of you on television that they [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=206.2s)]
*  are real people with real families and real feelings and real emotions and of course they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  are and we can never lose sight of that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=214.48s)]
*  Apparently this attacker 38 year old Cody Balmer was on the property evading police [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=216.56s)]
*  for several minutes on the property before he broke the window and then set the house [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=221.34s)]
*  on fire according to state police officials. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  Balmer allegedly made two Molotov cocktails from Heineken bottles he had at home and threw [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=229.06s)]
*  them inside the governor's mansion after breaking a window with a hammer according to court [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=233.66s)]
*  documents. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=237.5s)]
*  The fire chief described it as surreal to see fire shooting from the governor's residence. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=238.5s)]
*  He said firefighters had to cut parts of the gates to stretch hose lines inside and took [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=242.46s)]
*  about a half hour to get the fire under control. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=247.12s)]
*  He added there had never been a fire drill conducted at the governor's mansion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=250.34s)]
*  Apparently the door from the main dining room was closed at the time of the blaze, keeping [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=253.52s)]
*  the fire from spreading into the living quarters. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=257.88s)]
*  Had the door not been closed, the Harrisburg fire chief Brian Enterline said Shapiro and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=259.84s)]
*  his family would no doubt have been at risk. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=266.6s)]
*  After turning himself in Balmer allegedly told police he would have attacked Shapiro [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=269.52s)]
*  with a hammer, with the hammer if he had happened upon the governor inside the residence, a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=272.8s)]
*  document said. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=277.56s)]
*  Top Republicans gave statements reacting to the attack with US Attorney General Pam Bondi [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=278.56s)]
*  posting on X that she was quote deeply relieved that Governor Shapiro and his family are safe. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=283.64s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance said this incident was quote really disgusting violence and that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=288.16s)]
*  he hopes quote would whoever did this has brought swiftly to justice. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=292.08s)]
*  President Donald Trump, however, when asked about the attack Sunday night while returning [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=296.36s)]
*  to Washington aboard Air Force One said he had just heard about it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=300.02s)]
*  Doesn't mean you can't condemn it or send your thoughts, Mr. President, but you just [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  heard about it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  The others heard about it quicker because they're not the president who should be abreast [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  of everything. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  Then today during a meeting at the White House with El Salvador's President Trump was asked [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  if he heard about a possible motive and here's how he replied. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=316.28s)]
*  The attacker was not a fan of Trump, I understand, just from what I read and from what I've been [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  told. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=325.44s)]
*  The attacker basically wasn't a fan of anybody, he's probably just a whack job. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=327.28s)]
*  And certainly a thing like that cannot be allowed to happen. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=331.8s)]
*  It's about himself once again. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  The suspect is currently in a hospital getting treatment for a medical event not related [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=336.92s)]
*  to this incident. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=341.44s)]
*  Reminding us that in America even people who do bad things, even people who admit to their [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=343.08s)]
*  crimes are still treated ethically and with care and given due process. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=347.86s)]
*  Because that is what separates us from them and supposedly from any other nations as well. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=353.44s)]
*  Just hours before the fire, the Pennsylvania governor posted a picture of his family's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=359.04s)]
*  Passover Seder on X writing, from the Shapiro family Seder table to yours happy Passover [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=363.6s)]
*  and hug. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=368.68s)]
*  Pesach Zemeach. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=369.68s)]
*  Really, really scary, thank God it wasn't much worse. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=371.72s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, I'm tired about the what aboutisms. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=376.72s)]
*  So as all these things turn political, right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=380.8s)]
*  So you say, hey, I hope to God nobody ever does anything like this to Governor Shapiro. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  This is crazy, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=388.36s)]
*  And then some people will say, yeah, well, what about the Trump assassination attempts? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=390.18s)]
*  Yeah, those are also terrible. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=393.56s)]
*  And then the other side will say, what about the Nancy Pelosi husband attack? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=395.8s)]
*  They're all terrible. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=400.12s)]
*  We don't have to say what about back and forth. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=401.12s)]
*  Let's all sides left, right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=404.04s)]
*  I don't know if it involves anti-Semitism. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=408.24s)]
*  But certainly if it does, that 100%, we should all be against that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  This was not hard or complicated at all. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=417.62s)]
*  The thing with Trump is so maddening, man. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=420.06s)]
*  This is such a layup. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=422.32s)]
*  This doesn't have to be controversial. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=423.86s)]
*  My God, if somebody lit Sarah Huckabee Sanders home on fire, she's the governor of Arkansas. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=425.86s)]
*  Obviously, Republican used to be the spokesperson for Trump. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=430.54s)]
*  I'd be horrified. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=434.5s)]
*  My God, what do you, she's got kids. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=435.5s)]
*  She's a human being. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=438.42s)]
*  What are you, this is nuts. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=439.74s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=442.66s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=444.06s)]
*  So if our politics devolve to this, then we're screwed. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=445.42s)]
*  I mean, that's supposed to be one of the great parts of America, that we battle in the marketplace [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=448.22s)]
*  of ideas. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=452.86s)]
*  We allow for freedom of speech so that we can debate and argue over anything. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=453.86s)]
*  But if it spills over to physical violence, we're doomed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=458.38s)]
*  So I can't stand this. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=462.42s)]
*  And I like Governor Shapiro a lot. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=465.34000000000003s)]
*  He was one of my favorite Democrats to replace Biden. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=466.98s)]
*  If he had replaced Biden, I think he probably would have won. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=472.14000000000004s)]
*  But that's not the direction that it went. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=475.46000000000004s)]
*  But it doesn't matter how much I like him or don't like him. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=477.38s)]
*  It doesn't matter if he's a Democrat or a Republican or what his point of view on any [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=480.42s)]
*  particular issue is. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=484.14000000000004s)]
*  Totally, utterly unacceptable on all sides in every form. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=485.86s)]
*  Stop burning Teslas. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=491.46000000000004s)]
*  Whatever the hell, whoever the hell was doing that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  How does that help? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=494.3s)]
*  How does that help? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=495.42s)]
*  Stop burning anything and everything. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=496.42s)]
*  Stop, right? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=499.14000000000004s)]
*  Look, if you say, hey, Cenk, how's that gonna help, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=500.78000000000003s)]
*  These guys are crazy. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=503.3s)]
*  I don't know, maybe they listen to some media. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=505.06s)]
*  Maybe if all of right-wing media and all of left-wing media and mainstream media all said, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=507.86s)]
*  cut the crap out. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=513.62s)]
*  Don't ever do violence. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=515.0600000000001s)]
*  Don't ever do it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=517.02s)]
*  If you do, you're not one of us. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=518.02s)]
*  You're a wacko and you should be shunned in every imaginable way. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=520.14s)]
*  But yes, unfortunately, sometimes some people on whatever sides go, well, if our guy does [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  it, is it really that bad? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=532.22s)]
*  So why did Trump pause there on, hey, the governor's house was lit on fire and when [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=533.9399999999999s)]
*  they caught the guy, so there's a guy, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=539.02s)]
*  I mean, it's okay, you don't know his motive. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=540.98s)]
*  So easy to condemn, right? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=543.62s)]
*  But what if he condemns, but then later he wants to make fun of it like he did with the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  Pelosi thing and like, yeah, well, maybe it was his gay lover. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=551.14s)]
*  I don't do that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=554.78s)]
*  Don't, come on, guys. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=556.5s)]
*  Bounds of decency, Jesus Christ. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=558.54s)]
*  And so I love his attitude. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=561.82s)]
*  I love that they did the second night of Passover and they did it in the home. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=564.18s)]
*  That's exactly what you do. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=568.7s)]
*  You don't do it somewhere else. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=569.74s)]
*  You don't run. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=570.82s)]
*  You don't run from any of these fights. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=571.98s)]
*  You stand your ground and practice your faith and do all the things that you need to do. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=573.42s)]
*  All right, last thing is that we don't know yet why the guy did it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=580.18s)]
*  But it doesn't really matter, right? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=585.42s)]
*  Because they're unbalanced. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=588.06s)]
*  They're unfricking balanced. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=590.14s)]
*  So why did the guy attack Pelosi's husband with a hammer? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=592.38s)]
*  Cuz he's a loon. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=595.7399999999999s)]
*  No sane person attacks anyone with a hammer or tries to burn down their house. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=598.3s)]
*  So that's what unites them. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=603.3399999999999s)]
*  Shockingly, they didn't use a weapon, so thank God. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=605.9399999999999s)]
*  And of course, what's Trump's reaction even after he's had a chance to absorb it? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=608.5s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=612.14s)]
*  Was it a fate of Trump? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=614.46s)]
*  Great, that's the most important thing. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=616.46s)]
*  Okay, thank God it's not about you. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=618.82s)]
*  Jesus Christ, man. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=621.86s)]
*  He has no ability to have empathy, none. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=623.86s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=626.1s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=627.74s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-dRXWtfPo&t=630.66s)]
