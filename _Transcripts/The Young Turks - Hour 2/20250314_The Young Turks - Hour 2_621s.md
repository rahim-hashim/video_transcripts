"President Donald Trump rarely stops bragging about his ‚Äúgreat relationship‚Äù with Vladimir Putin.

A skeptical world will soon find out whether the supposed mind-meld counts for anything.

The Russian president, author of an unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine, responded in time-honored Moscow fashion Thursday to the US plan for an immediate ceasefire that the administration forced Kyiv into supporting. Putin produced a long set of obfuscations and new demands that would be unacceptable to Ukraine. But they may have been designed to tempt a US president who is desperate for the kind of win a truce would represent."*

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Putin Sabotaging Trump‚Äôs Ceasefire Deal with Ukraine???
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc)
*  Earlier this week, we brought you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=0.0s)]
*  the very good news that Ukraine has [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=1.92s)]
*  accepted the terms of a ceasefire [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=3.84s)]
*  deal that was endorsed by [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=5.7s)]
*  the United States. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=7.2s)]
*  The only thing is that now Russia [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=8.86s)]
*  also have to agree to the ceasefire [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=10.72s)]
*  agreement. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=12.64s)]
*  And at the moment, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=13.72s)]
*  they're not doing that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=14.68s)]
*  They're giving some mixed signals, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=15.84s)]
*  which is not as reassuring as we [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=17.84s)]
*  would like it to be. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=19.48s)]
*  In a press briefing yesterday, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=20.6s)]
*  Vladimir Putin said the following. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=22.64s)]
*  He said, we agree with the proposal [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=25.76s)]
*  for a ceasefire to cease [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=27.8s)]
*  hostilities, but we proceed from [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=29.24s)]
*  the fact that this ceasefire should [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  lead to an enduring peace and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=33.08s)]
*  should remove the root cause of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=34.56s)]
*  this crisis. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=36.44s)]
*  We are in favor of it, but [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=37.96s)]
*  there are nuances. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=39.44s)]
*  That is interesting. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=41.0s)]
*  We need to talk to our American [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  colleagues and partners about this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Maybe call President Trump and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  discuss it with him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=47.56s)]
*  But we support the idea of ending [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=48.8s)]
*  this conflict by peaceful means. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=50.68s)]
*  That is interesting because he [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=52.68s)]
*  started the conflict, right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=54.44s)]
*  You can't end the conflict by [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  peaceful means that you started by [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=58.08s)]
*  not peaceful means in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=59.64s)]
*  the first place. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=60.56s)]
*  Also, what is the root cause of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=61.4s)]
*  the crisis? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  I don't need to explain that to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  this audience. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=65.24s)]
*  It is a crazy thing for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=65.88s)]
*  him to have said. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=66.96s)]
*  Putin spoke to Trump's envoy, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=68.52s)]
*  Steve Witkoff last night. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=70.4s)]
*  And according to Trump, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=72.36s)]
*  the discussions went very well. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=73.4s)]
*  Here's what he posted over [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  on Truth Social. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=76.2s)]
*  He said, we had very good and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=77.6s)]
*  productive discussions with [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=79.32s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin of Russia [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=81.08s)]
*  yesterday, and there is a very good [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=83.24s)]
*  chance that this horrible bloody [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=85.36s)]
*  war will come to an end. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=87.4s)]
*  But at this very moment, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=88.68s)]
*  thousands of Ukrainian troops are [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=90.2s)]
*  completely surrounded by [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  the Russian military and in a very [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=93.76s)]
*  bad and vulnerable position. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=95.68s)]
*  I have strongly requested to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  President Putin that their lives [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=99.04s)]
*  be spared. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=100.92s)]
*  This would be a horrible massacre, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=101.48s)]
*  not one seen since World War II. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=103.56s)]
*  God bless them all. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, that is reassuring to see [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=107.72s)]
*  such compassion from the President. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  We don't often see that kind of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=111.56s)]
*  compassion and it does sound like [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  a very, very scary situation that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  these Ukrainian troops are in right [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=116.4s)]
*  at this very moment, right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=118.48s)]
*  The only thing is that the Ukrainian [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=121.08s)]
*  military has said that that is not [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  what's happening right now in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=124.78s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=126.36s)]
*  There are not thousands of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=126.88s)]
*  Ukrainian troops that are surrounded [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=128.24s)]
*  by Russians right now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=130.2s)]
*  An anonymous Ukrainian soldier in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=131.32s)]
*  the region told the New York Times [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=133.2s)]
*  that the situation was, quote, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=135.16s)]
*  bad, almost critical. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=137.12s)]
*  But it wasn't quite as severe as [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=138.72s)]
*  what Trump was saying it was. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=140.4s)]
*  So meanwhile, Zelensky, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=142.0s)]
*  he's accusing the Russians of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=143.76s)]
*  dragging out the negotiation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=145.72s)]
*  process. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  This is what he posted on X. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=148.0s)]
*  He said the exchange of prisoners [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  and an unconditional 30 day full [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  interim ceasefire are the first [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  quick steps that could significantly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  bring us closer to a just and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=157.84s)]
*  lasting peace. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=159.36s)]
*  Ukraine is ready to take these [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=160.6s)]
*  steps because the Ukrainian people [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=162.28s)]
*  want peace more than anyone. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=164.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, the world sees how [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=166.08s)]
*  Russia is deliberately setting [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=167.72s)]
*  conditions that only complicate and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=169.44s)]
*  drag out the process, as Russia is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=171.4s)]
*  the only party that wants to war [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=173.44s)]
*  the war to continue and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=175.48s)]
*  diplomacy to break down. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=177.04s)]
*  So just to recap, here is what [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  the ceasefire plan would actually [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=181.2s)]
*  entail. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=183.12s)]
*  First of all, all fighting would [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=184.4s)]
*  end for 30 days. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=186.04s)]
*  It would be a 30 day ceasefire. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=186.76s)]
*  Once a ceasefire takes place, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=188.4s)]
*  it can then be extended, quote, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=190.12s)]
*  by mutual agreement of the parties. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=191.92s)]
*  And the 30 day pause in fighting [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=194.48s)]
*  does not include security [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=196.32s)]
*  guarantees from the United States. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=197.76s)]
*  The Trump administration has also [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=200.2s)]
*  resumed sharing military aid and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  intelligence with Ukraine now that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  they've signed on to the agreement. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  And Russia is currently retaking [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=207.72s)]
*  Ukrainian land. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=209.72s)]
*  So they do have a bit of an upper [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=210.95999999999998s)]

*  So the momentum of the war is also [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=214.6s)]
*  on their side. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=216.48s)]
*  Here are some of their conditions [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  for this deal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=219.56s)]
*  This is reporting from [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=220.83999999999997s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal says, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=221.88s)]
*  Moscow insists on keeping at [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  a minimum the 18% of Ukrainian [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=225.0s)]
*  territory it already controls in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  any peace deal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=228.72s)]
*  It wants to reverse policies that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  have guidelines Russian cultural [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=233.04s)]

*  Organization. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=240.32s)]
*  So we'll have to see how this all [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=241.24s)]
*  turns out. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=243.44s)]
*  It's not going great right now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=244.28s)]
*  At least they're talking, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=247.36s)]
*  which is an improvement, I guess. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=248.68s)]
*  But we're going to have to see how [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=250.48s)]
*  much pressure Trump is willing to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=252.28s)]
*  put on Russia to get this deal [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=254.12s)]
*  signed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=255.72s)]
*  I think he wants the deal to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=256.28s)]
*  happen because it would look really [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=257.72s)]
*  good for him if he's able to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=259.72s)]
*  negotiate a peace deal between [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  He did say he was going to end [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  the war within 24 hours. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=265.88s)]
*  He hasn't done that as 24 hours, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=267.32s)]
*  sorry, of becoming the president. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  And he's been president for [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=271.52s)]
*  over 50 days now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=272.72s)]
*  So he's had a lot of 24 hour [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=273.48s)]
*  periods to work on this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=275.08s)]
*  So I think he wants to get it done. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=276.92s)]
*  I don't know why he needs to lie [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=279.16s)]
*  about Ukrainian troops being [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=280.64s)]
*  surrounded by Russians in order to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=282.08s)]
*  get this done. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=283.92s)]
*  But he also, I don't think, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=284.64s)]
*  wants to upset his friend Putin. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=286.36s)]
*  Sharon, we'll start with you this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=288.8s)]
*  time. What do you make of this? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=290.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's official. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=291.52s)]
*  The lie becomes the truth. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=292.92s)]
*  Why does he lie? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  Because he's just used to it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=295.04s)]
*  That's his normal. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=296.56s)]
*  It's sad, and I can't imagine what [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=298.64s)]
*  it feels like to be Ukrainian today [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  or Zelensky because just because [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=303.64s)]
*  Trump declares that it's over and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=305.68s)]
*  has some sham deal, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=307.64s)]
*  which it will be because Putin [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=308.72s)]
*  doesn't adhere to anything without [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  consequences and Trump will not [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=312.08s)]
*  hold him to consequences. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  I can't imagine the fear and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=315.68s)]
*  the terror and not getting back [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  what they deserve. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=319.36s)]
*  That they're going through right [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  now, but it's just sick. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=322.36s)]
*  And so is Trump. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  And it's also about what happens [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=324.72s)]
*  next. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=326.92s)]
*  Like I said, Putin's not going to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  play fair or play by the rules. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=330.16s)]
*  The whole notion that Vladimir [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=332.48s)]
*  Putin cares entirely about [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump is false. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=337.16s)]
*  So what Putin and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump have very different [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=340.20000000000005s)]
*  motivations. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=342.48s)]
*  Putin is not going to be dissuaded [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=343.76s)]
*  from what he ultimately wants. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=345.8s)]
*  And he does not want Ukraine to be [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  part of NATO. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=349.84s)]
*  And he does want to hold on to that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  piece of geography. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=353.0s)]
*  And that is not going, whatever [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump says or thinks, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=356.56s)]
*  that's not going to stop Putin at [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=358.64s)]
*  a certain point. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=360.88s)]
*  He'll let Trump criticize him. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=362.12s)]
*  He'll let Trump push back on it, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=364.08s)]
*  but he has his goals and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=365.88s)]
*  he won't be stopped from that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=367.23999999999995s)]
*  The other part of it is that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=369.32s)]
*  the whole idea, Trump will say [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=371.23999999999995s)]
*  anything to get to what he wants. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  And we've seen that and by the way, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=375.84s)]
*  it's worked, right? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=378.88s)]
*  I mean, he makes this stuff up, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=380.56s)]
*  he lies, and he's been president [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  and he's been reelected president. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  So something he does works with [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  the segment of people that it [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=387.23999999999995s)]
*  needs to work with. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=388.67999999999995s)]
*  It doesn't work with Europe. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=389.76s)]
*  It doesn't work with the nations [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=391.56s)]
*  that are on board now in helping [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=394.2s)]
*  Ukraine, but it's going to be [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  a big challenge and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=399.23999999999995s)]
*  his diplomacy is not their [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=400.64s)]
*  diplomacy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=402.44s)]
*  So this is a frail ceasefire and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=403.2s)]
*  it's one that nobody wants to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  see, one that nobody is going to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=408.06s)]
*  see endure as I mean, look at what [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=410.62s)]
*  we've seen between Israel and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=413.2s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=415.56s)]
*  There's ceasefires on paper, but [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=417.1s)]
*  ceasefires that don't endure or [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=419.54s)]
*  are announced to start at a certain [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=421.9s)]
*  time and end at a certain time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  It's very regressive ceasefire and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=426.58s)]
*  I think Ukraine knows what it [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=429.1s)]
*  wants and it's not going to just [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=431.3s)]
*  sign an agreement because Russia [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=433.68s)]
*  says one thing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=436.18s)]
*  He was trying to say that time [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=437.42s)]
*  when he was at the White House, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=438.98s)]
*  even if Russia agrees to a ceasefire, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  the Ukrainian people, they cannot [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=442.7s)]
*  trust that Russia is going to hold [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=444.58s)]
*  to that ceasefire because Russia, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=446.42s)]
*  they're the ones who invaded [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=448.42s)]
*  the Ukrainians in the first place, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=449.86s)]
*  right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=451.62s)]
*  They're the ones who carried out [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=452.14s)]
*  this 100 year old antiquated war [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=454.5s)]

*  territory. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=459.38s)]
*  And the 18% of territory that they [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=460.3s)]
*  want to retain that they say we get [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=462.74s)]
*  to keep because we earned it, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=465.1s)]
*  they're stealing land from [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=467.53999999999996s)]
*  the Ukrainian people. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=469.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, regardless of [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=470.14s)]
*  how just or legal this war in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=472.53999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine is deemed to be or however [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=474.29999999999995s)]
*  history is going to see this war, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=476.5s)]
*  it doesn't matter because that's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=478.58s)]
*  how war goes sometimes. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=480.7s)]
*  It's not fair, it's not fun, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=482.46s)]
*  people die, things are lost. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=484.14s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=486.02s)]
*  is it worth it for Ukraine to see [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=487.5s)]
*  nearly 20% of their territory just [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=489.46s)]
*  so that Russia will stop killing [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=491.82s)]
*  their people and trying to take [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=493.9s)]
*  more and more of their land? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=495.82s)]
*  I also thought it was interesting [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  the point about how Russia wants [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=499.42s)]
*  the right to influence [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=501.54s)]
*  the culture in Ukraine. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=502.82s)]
*  They want to spread that Russian [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=504.34s)]
*  culture and Russia is always kind [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=506.34s)]
*  of an interesting story to me. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=508.26s)]
*  Not just this story right now, but [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=510.7s)]
*  just historically looking at Russia [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=512.5s)]
*  because look at how big it is, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=514.42s)]
*  right? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=515.98s)]
*  You could also say this about [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=516.7s)]
*  China, you could also say this [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=517.74s)]
*  about the United States, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=518.78s)]
*  you can say this about any kind of [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=519.9s)]
*  imperial nation. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=521.26s)]
*  Whenever you grab land, right, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=522.74s)]
*  all that land wasn't all Russia. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=525.86s)]
*  But now all those little [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=527.66s)]
*  communities and groups and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=529.1s)]
*  little micro ethnicities that were [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=530.78s)]
*  once there, now they're just [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=532.98s)]
*  blanketed over and they live under [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=534.78s)]
*  this umbrella of Russianism. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=536.66s)]
*  So it is cultural erasure and [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=538.3000000000001s)]
*  that's what the Russians are trying [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=539.66s)]
*  to do in Ukraine right now. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=541.38s)]
*  There are a lot of similarities in [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=543.02s)]
*  their cultures already, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=544.7s)]
*  because they were a part of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=546.1800000000001s)]
*  the Soviet Union. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=547.66s)]
*  But the idea that you're trying to [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=548.82s)]
*  deny the Ukrainians the right to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=550.54s)]
*  just live their lives the way they [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=552.3000000000001s)]
*  want to live their lives is very, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=554.14s)]
*  very sad and very upsetting. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=555.9s)]
*  And yeah, Sharon, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=557.5s)]
*  it's like what you were saying, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=558.22s)]
*  I can't imagine what it's like to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=559.62s)]
*  be Ukrainian right now and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=561.02s)]
*  to be over there. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=562.26s)]
*  I know Ukrainian people and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=563.46s)]
*  it is very difficult for [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=564.82s)]
*  them right now. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and remember, they not only [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=567.38s)]
*  want to keep the 20% that they, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=569.5400000000001s)]
*  quote unquote, earn, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=571.62s)]
*  they want to keep the children too. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=573.02s)]
*  All those children that were [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=575.0600000000001s)]
*  frankly abducted and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=576.78s)]
*  they're going to be raised with [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=578.02s)]
*  the Russian values and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=579.9s)]
*  the Russian way of life. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=581.26s)]
*  It is just despicable. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=583.1s)]
*  And again, how much longer can [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=585.34s)]
*  a country hold on? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=587.1800000000001s)]
*  This isn't the first territory or [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=588.46s)]
*  loss of life that they've had at [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=590.5400000000001s)]
*  the hands of Putin, and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=592.34s)]
*  he will stop at nothing. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=593.74s)]
*  The rest of Europe most seem to get [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=595.7s)]
*  it and we unfortunately have [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=598.1s)]
*  a president who thinks he can [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=600.1s)]
*  rubber stamp something and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=601.94s)]
*  then make backdoor deals. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=603.82s)]
*  Certainly he's talking to Putin, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=605.78s)]
*  backdoor and it's not on the up and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=607.98s)]
*  up as if anything has been with [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=610.3000000000001s)]
*  this horrific war. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpIlPxqH4hc&t=612.42s)]
