"Fox News host Will Cain said Jeffrey Goldberg, who had the scoop of a lifetime fall into his lap, had an obligation to extricate himself from the situation.

On Monday, Goldberg published a bombshell story in The Atlantic in which National Security Advisor Mike Waltz had inadvertently added him to a Signal group chat of top Trump administration officials. Goldberg soon observed the officials ‚Äì including Waltz, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth discussing forthcoming airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen."*

# Fox News Host's BIZARRE Take on Signalgate: It Was The Reporters Fault!!!
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc)
*  It's worth returning to the center of the story, the center of the matter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=0.0s)]
*  And at the center of the story is a person. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=4.64s)]
*  It's Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Is there not some ethical obligation on Jeffrey Goldberg to announce himself and to leave? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=8.6s)]
*  He literally is the story. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=13.76s)]
*  But for his presence, it's not a story. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=15.92s)]
*  It's not as though he uncovered Watergate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=18.8s)]
*  He overheard something through a wall that happened to matter to national security. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=20.64s)]
*  His presence is the story. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=24.64s)]
*  What obligation does Jeffrey Goldberg have to make himself not the story? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=27.9s)]
*  Finally, someone is speaking common sense into this Signalgate controversy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=33.1s)]
*  Because the entire blame falls on the reporter. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=39.78s)]
*  The reporter who somehow decided to add himself to a group chat on an unauthorized messaging [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=42.9s)]
*  app by the national security advisor. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=48.78s)]
*  The again national security advisor or the Secretary of Defense because why would it? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=52.1s)]
*  You just heard from Fox News host Will Kane, who did his best to try to make us think that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=61.7s)]
*  the sky is green or something. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=67.74000000000001s)]
*  It's his turn to run cover for the Trump administration, I suppose, put the blame onto anyone else. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=70.34s)]
*  Not Pete Hegseth or Tim Walls, the ones who were so reckless in this situation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=76.56s)]
*  Cenk, I guess we'll start with this, your initial reaction to Kane's logic there because [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=82.44s)]
*  he really was full throated with it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=87.76s)]
*  He put his heart and soul into it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=90.08s)]
*  You almost think he actually believes this? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=91.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, the story isn't that a bunch of dumbasses who work at the highest levels of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  government put classified information on a signal chat and accidentally invited a reporter. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=102.84s)]
*  They're not at fault at all. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=110.12s)]
*  It's the reporter who got added. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=112.72s)]
*  It's all his fault. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  Does anyone believe that? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, actually we have a little bit of the answer later in the story. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=118.12s)]
*  What percentage of Republicans think that this is a serious problem? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  You might be surprised at the answer, but back to you, Sharon. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=125.98s)]
*  All right, let's give you a little bit more of the argument and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=129.52s)]
*  then we'll get into more of the severity of signal gate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=132.52s)]
*  I mean, this was serious stuff, listen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  What is the role of Jeffrey Goldberg? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=139.24s)]
*  He literally is the center of the story. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=141.76s)]
*  He got invited, apparently, perhaps, maybe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=144.32s)]
*  He got included in a private group deliberation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=148.12s)]
*  Now, if you or I get invited to a party, brought into a party that we really just [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=153.0s)]
*  weren't supposed to be at, we didn't get an invitation, we politely excuse ourselves. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  Maybe that makes light of the situation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=161.2s)]
*  Improper disclosures are always made in the legal world. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  Private filings, information you shouldn't receive is sometimes sent over email to the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=167.16s)]
*  wrong person. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=171.64s)]
*  Lawyers bow out, announce their presence, and say it's time to move on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  We saw none of that here with Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  Instead, he sat around under the implausible rationale that he wanted to find out if it [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=179.76s)]
*  was real. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  He never bowed out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=186.44s)]
*  He never announced himself. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=187.8s)]
*  Instead, the first the world heard of it is when he published what he claimed to be classified [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=189.04s)]
*  documents and overhyped and oversold as war plans. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=194.72s)]
*  Is there not some ethical obligation on Jeffrey Goldberg to announce himself and to leave? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=198.24s)]
*  And by the way, who do you know that gets into a party uninvited and leaves? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  No one, okay? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=209.16s)]
*  So none of this makes any sense. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=210.16s)]
*  This was a scoop of a lifetime. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=212.52s)]
*  If this were a Democratic administration and it was Will Kane instead of Goldberg, would [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=214.36s)]
*  he have the same opinion? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  Of course not, okay? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=219.24s)]
*  But this also shows how much Republicans are downplaying the matter. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=221.0s)]
*  But according to a recent YouGov poll published earlier this week, a majority of Americans [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=224.24s)]
*  believe this is a serious problem. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  Let's look at it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  74% of voters believe this to be at least a serious issue. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  And notably, when you break it down by political party, 60% of Republicans responded that the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  chat was serious. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=246.72s)]
*  So people do get it, okay? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=249.2s)]
*  Very serious, somewhat serious. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=253.68s)]
*  I mean, look at the numbers there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=255.0s)]
*  They get it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  Those people are right. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=259.2s)]
*  This is a serious issue because it's putting not only our soldiers at risk, but our allies [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=260.76s)]
*  too, and they're weighing in. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=264.24s)]
*  According to the Daily Mail, during the day of the March 15th strikes, a British Voyager [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=265.88000000000005s)]
*  plane was used to refuel American jets that defended the carrier that launched the strikes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  The former head of the British Army, Lord Dennett, told the Telegraph this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  As US officials gave away classified information about future operations in which the Royal [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  Air Force were involved, this undoubtedly placed British personnel at higher risk. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  I hope the White House will tighten its security rapidly and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  considerably will continue to operate with the US, but [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=298.8s)]
*  need to be confident about their operational security. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  The hypocrisy here is just incredible, okay? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=309.16s)]
*  The allies aren't even weighing whether this was somewhat classified, somewhat serious. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=313.68s)]
*  They say this is classified and you put our people at risk. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=318.44s)]
*  While we can't and won't pull out right now, we're not going to dis America. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=322.04s)]
*  We're going to continue to support you, but we're not too confident. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=327.08s)]
*  We don't trust you right now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=329.76s)]
*  Cenk, you start and then Ramesh. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=331.44s)]
*  Yeah, so 60% of Republicans saying that it's a serious mistake and a problem. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=333.56s)]
*  Hey, a little bit of hope in the world. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=342.4s)]
*  Okay, that's a significant majority of his party saying, yeah, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=345.12s)]
*  that was definitely wrong. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, a lot of folks also online including a lot of right wing hosts and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=353.32s)]
*  host the middle, Portnoy and Tommy Lauren, but Piers Morgan as well, etc. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=358.08s)]
*  All saying, admit the mistake, pretending that it wasn't your fault and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=362.96s)]
*  it was no big deal and it didn't involve national security are all absurd, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=367.88s)]
*  totally utterly absurd. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=373.72s)]
*  And so and when you get to the hypocrisy, we'll get to that in a second actually [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=375.44s)]
*  because others have made similar mistakes. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=380.32s)]
*  How were they treated? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  We'll tell you that but back to Wil Cain's excuses. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=384.36s)]
*  Get look, I got a friend who adds me to a lot of text threads. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=388.32000000000005s)]
*  And so that like, we probably all have one friend like this. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=391.76s)]
*  So he keeps adding us and it's a bunch of guys and we're joking around and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=396.36s)]
*  then he added me to a new one this a couple years ago. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=399.32000000000005s)]
*  And then I responded with a pretty coarse story about a hookup and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=402.16s)]
*  I'd forgotten to check who's in the text thread. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=406.68s)]
*  It turns out there was over 30 people, half of them women that I don't even know. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=411.0s)]
*  It was like his other group of friends and he had added me to it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=416.12s)]
*  I'm like, my God, what have you done? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=418.84s)]
*  Okay, you know whose fault that was? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=421.28s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=423.92s)]
*  Of course, on this story, I'm going to go digest for [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=425.6s)]
*  but I have several thoughts on the larger sort of story of Jeff Goldberg and so on. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=429.04s)]
*  First of all, as you all covered, everyone knows he's the editor in chief of the Atlantic. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  The Atlantic tends to follow and Goldberg himself, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=439.88000000000005s)]
*  particular sort of strand of coverage that rarely questions American exceptionalism. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=442.92s)]
*  And certainly Goldberg himself has been a very, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=449.24s)]
*  if at all questions the genocide in Gaza, which now we're apparently being gagged [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=452.32s)]
*  about by the administration as well. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=457.28s)]
*  So in many ways, I think it's the story of a supposedly secure chat on signal, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=459.44s)]
*  which is never secure, not being secure, masks the reality that Goldberg and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  the Atlantic have had a lot of complaints about. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=469.79999999999995s)]
*  And so I think that's the story of Jeff Goldberg and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=473.67999999999995s)]
*  the reality that Goldberg and the Atlantic have had a lot of complicity in [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=477.68s)]
*  the normalization of the genocide and ongoing brutal violence [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  against the Palestinian peoples in the West Bank as well. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=488.76s)]
*  Everyone knows that a signal chat is not actually secure. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=493.88s)]
*  Signal is actually branded as the secure kind of peer to peer messaging, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  texting, messaging app. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  But WhatsApp is also branded as similarly end to end encrypted. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=504.68s)]
*  Signal does have more levels of encryption, but I think we should all recognize [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=508.68s)]
*  that pretty much any corporate or commercial platform that we exchange [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=513.96s)]
*  communications on is open for surveillance and the grabbing of data. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=518.12s)]
*  Or idiotic mistakes such as this where you add the editor in chief of the Atlantic [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=522.64s)]
*  to the very chat thread. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=527.6s)]
*  I do want to note that Trump is just incredible at avoiding the criticism that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=529.6s)]
*  he should deserve in this situation and just notice the comparison with his [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=534.28s)]
*  very successful, brutal and mean attacks on Hillary Clinton [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=539.24s)]
*  dating back to the 2016 era. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=544.44s)]
*  So I mean, it's really as far as Republicans being unhappy with this [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=547.52s)]
*  occurring and seeing it as a serious issue, I think Americans are unhappy with [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=553.64s)]
*  pretty much almost every politician. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=559.04s)]
*  I'm unhappy with almost every member of the United States Congress and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=561.04s)]
*  certainly the President, except a few progressives in mainly in the House at [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=564.8s)]
*  this point, and certainly Bernie. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=570.56s)]
*  But so people being unhappy with the status quo is the new normal. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=573.08s)]
*  Goldberg is definitely one who would shield if not support US brutal attacks on [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=579.2s)]
*  these who are in my opinion, at least trying to stand up and show some resistance to [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=585.24s)]
*  what is going on, which is everyone just saying, hey, it's okay to just do this to [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=592.12s)]
*  these Palestinian peoples because there's no leverage and now many of us are afraid [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=597.84s)]
*  of acting up. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=602.36s)]
*  I mean, as a professor at a university, I just see this issue constantly. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=604.24s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=608.36s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rui9dVpKerc&t=611.44s)]
