The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Ana DEFENDS Megyn Kelly From Triggered Conservative Women
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw)
*  Some conservative women are big math at Megyn Kelly for encouraging them to be financially [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=0.0s)]
*  independent while also pursuing marriage, children, a family if that's what they want. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=6.4s)]
*  Now, let me just pause and say I totally acknowledge the insane challenges of being a woman who has it [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=12.56s)]
*  all. I do think that for far too long, the propaganda made it seem as though women can do [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  it all. It's not a big deal. They could have a career and raise a family. Obviously, that is an [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=27.2s)]
*  incredibly difficult thing to do, but some women have accomplished that. Some women who really want [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=32.96s)]
*  that can do it. And so Megyn Kelly says, ladies, it is possible to make your own money, have your [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=38.8s)]
*  own career, pay for your own swanky New York City apartment, that part I disagree with, and find a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=45.68s)]
*  man who loves you, wants to have and raise children with you, and wants to be with you, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=51.76s)]
*  and only you. The only thing stopping you, your decision to settle for less. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=57.76s)]
*  So I'm sure in her mind, this was her way of putting out an encouraging, inspiring message [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=62.96s)]
*  to women who might be interested in having it all. But people didn't take it that way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=67.84s)]
*  Okay, a lot of women were upset about this, which is depressing, but let me just weigh in on one [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=73.84s)]
*  part of her tweet. Look, I mean, unless you're working for a Wall Street firm, hedge fund manager, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=79.6s)]
*  you're literally working in the financial sector, you're not gonna be able to afford a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=88.16s)]
*  swanky New York City apartment alone, okay? You need to make a lot of money to afford that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=92.32s)]
*  But the rest of her post, I think, is totally fine. Now, some people absolutely lost it, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=97.44s)]
*  John, including one American news anchor, so that's OAN, Stephanie Hamill, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  who responded with this little nugget. This may be one of the most toxic and delusional posts [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=110.24s)]
*  I've seen all week. Wait, on X? Okay, but here's the rest. I'm a month out from giving birth, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  and I have a toddler. I can assure you, I'm not in boss babe mode. I'm surviving, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=126.32s)]
*  even with house help. It would be interesting to know more about Megan's child care support system, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=132.4s)]
*  especially when her kids were babies. Did her family help? How many hours a day did she have [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=138.4s)]
*  a nanny or daycare? How much house help? Now, let's just address the elephant in the room, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=144.32s)]
*  which is the fact that Stephanie Hamill is an anchor, meaning she has a career, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=152.72s)]
*  and clearly she has children as well. It's hard, it's challenging. Megan Kelly didn't [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=159.04s)]
*  allege that it would be easy, but she is having it all, right? She's got a family, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=164.4s)]
*  and she has a career. So I don't know why this is such a big deal. Did they want Megan Kelly to also [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=169.6s)]
*  include that it's gonna be challenging? Because I feel like that doesn't need to be said. I think [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=176.88s)]
*  people know that. But what do you think, John? Yeah, I'm trying to just respond to this message [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  and tell myself I don't know anything about what Megan Kelly has said about women or feminism or [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  anything like that in the past. And unfortunately, I do. I'm clearly not drinking as much as I need [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=193.12s)]
*  to or will soon be. I think that to be able to forget what I know about Megan Kelly, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=198.0s)]
*  the statement itself is fine. It's a little shallow, a little vapid, but it could be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=206.32s)]
*  encouraging, I think. Yes, your decisions do matter. I think that it's also, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=213.52s)]
*  it's kind of like, I don't know, for people's career, for their life outcome, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  it's like telling people save the environment just by using the right straws. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=224.72s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you can make that decision, and you should, but a lot of stuff affects [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=229.44s)]
*  your outcome. It's not purely based on you not settling for nothing. I think that's what some [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=234.24s)]
*  people are responding with. Now, you could also respond by saying, well, it's Twitter. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=238.08s)]
*  She can't put everything that she's thinking about this topic into one tweet. Then her tweets [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=242.72s)]
*  will look like Marjorie Taylor Greene's, and I don't wanna see those. And so, I think it's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=247.2s)]
*  fine encouragement. I've seen a lot of people implying that it's actually like a response to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=251.84s)]
*  the whole Elon Musk conservative journalist thing or whatever. It's fine. Yeah, sure. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=256.16s)]
*  That's my thought. It's fine. I don't think it's a particularly insightful thing. Hopefully, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=263.6s)]
*  people already know that. I don't know. It's Twitter. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=267.2s)]
*  I just think it's like, I can't believe that post turned into like this big story. It's X, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  where people say some of the most ridiculous, unfounded, toxic garbage imaginable. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=276.0s)]
*  But I wanna just give you one more statement from Hamill, the OAN news anchor who also decides to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=282.32000000000005s)]
*  get super judgy about whether Megyn Kelly is a good enough homemaker. She says, I remember [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=290.0s)]
*  Megyn admitting she doesn't cook during a Thanksgiving show episode. So what do they eat? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=294.56s)]
*  Does her husband cook? Do they eat takeout frequently? Private chef? This type of post [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=300.88s)]
*  puts very unrealistic pressures on most mothers. I don't know. I don't know. A lot of people don't [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=307.52s)]
*  cook. A lot of women don't cook. Who cares? I don't think that's that big of a deal. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=313.68s)]
*  But others like CS Johnson, who's an author, accused Kelly of being a feminist. That was the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=318.88s)]
*  real offense here. Ladies, it's also possible you'll win the lottery. Adjust your expectations [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=325.04s)]
*  and enthusiasm and drive accordingly. Realistic expectations are better here than engagement [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=331.12s)]
*  farming feminist talking points. Okay, all right. I think we should live in a society where women [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=336.56s)]
*  get to decide. So if you do wanna have it all, I would like a better economic situation that would [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=345.76s)]
*  make it possible for more women to have it all for sure. I didn't wanna have it all. I didn't [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=352.32s)]
*  wanna have kids. I pursued the career instead. And I'm not really sure that makes me happier, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=356.8s)]
*  but it doesn't matter. You get to decide. You get to decide. That's the whole point. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=362.4s)]
*  By the way, I don't see it as settling if someone decides they wanna be a homemaker and mother. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  In fact, I think that's a harder job than any other job. And I mean that, okay? It's incredibly [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=372.56s)]
*  difficult to raise children, to dedicate your life, to give up any aspirations you might have [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=378.8s)]
*  on a career, to instead focus all of your attention on having children. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=385.44s)]
*  And by the way, the sense I get, John, is that they're more upset about the fact [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  that she's encouraging women to pursue careers. Because conservative women don't want that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  They want women to be stay at home mothers, which is great. If you wanna be a stay at home mother, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  do you boo. But you should also be advocating for a better economic system [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=405.36s)]
*  that allows for a single family household to thrive. Because right now, we don't have that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=410.0s)]
*  John- Not at all. Yeah, and in particular, I think that there's an unspoken agreement [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=415.36s)]
*  that obviously the right wants to have some women in media. For PR, it's good for them or whatever. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  They are probably generally annoyed by them, but they want a few. But they're all supposed to imply [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  that what they're doing, a focus on career, being ambitious, wanting power and influence, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=433.6s)]
*  women generally are not supposed to do that. I know I'm talking to you through the TV or [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=439.28s)]
*  whatever, but you're not supposed to aspire to this. That's why you'll have people like Ann Coulter, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=442.96s)]
*  who they obviously are wildly ambitious career-focused people that then tell other [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=448.0s)]
*  women they shouldn't have the right to vote. You get to have the nice house and the nice car, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=453.12s)]
*  but you're not supposed to lift other women up with you. That's the covenant. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=458.08s)]
*  And Megyn Kelly, I don't even think that she really is violating that, but she seems to be [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=461.76s)]
*  in a tweet. And so that's enough to really anger them, I think. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=466.64s)]
*  Ann Coulter- Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. Now, she did address this whole debacle on her [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=469.92s)]
*  show recently. So today, Megyn Kelly addressed it and also made clear that her post was in part a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=476.96s)]
*  reference to Ashley St. Clair, a conservative influencer who has stated that she recently gave [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  birth to Elon Musk's 13th child. Musk has not responded to the claim. Let's take a look. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=490.08s)]
*  Ann Coulter- This is her in this swanky New York apartment, which is described as lavish. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  I posted on Twitter, you can have a swanky New York apartment. You could earn money and actually [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  wind up renting one yourself. You could also find a man who wants to marry you and raise children [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=509.36s)]
*  with you. You do not have to make a choice where you try to bang the billionaire to get his baby [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=515.2s)]
*  so that he'll put you up in some lavish New York City apartment and take care of you for the rest [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=520.4000000000001s)]
*  of his life and then be shocked, shocked when he doesn't actually wanna have a relationship with you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  Ann Coulter- You heard it here first, folks. Don't bang the billionaire unless you're married or if [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=528.88s)]
*  you're doing it simply to afford a swanky New York City apartment. So I guess that's what spurred her [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  post on social media. Do you buy it, John? John- Yeah, I mean, I buy that that's what she was [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=541.92s)]
*  going for. I think that that complicates the message that she's saying a little bit. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhToL7kmAw&t=547.36s)]
