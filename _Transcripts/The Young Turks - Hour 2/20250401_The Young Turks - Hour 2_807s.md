"Sen. Cory Booker spent all of Monday night and into Tuesday evening on the Senate floor, delivering an impassioned speech in protest of the Trump administration's policies. This effort, which also involves numerous other Democrats, is inching closer to a record by the hour.

The New Jersey Democrat took the podium at 7 p.m. ET on Monday, vowing to speak "for as long as I am physically able." He was still standing ‚Äî with glasses on and papers in hand ‚Äî as of 6:20 p.m. Tuesday, taking periodic breaks from speaking by yielding to questions and statements from his colleagues."

# Cory Booker's BLOCKBUSTER Daylong Speech Makes History
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI)
*  I'm about to go to the Senate floor where I intend to be recognized and when I am, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=0.0s)]
*  I am not gonna stop speaking. I'm gonna not stop standing. I'm gonna go for as long as I'm [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=4.88s)]
*  physically able to go. I've been hearing from people all over my state and indeed all over [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=10.4s)]
*  the nation calling upon folks in Congress to do more, to do things that recognize the urgency, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=15.76s)]
*  the crisis of the moment. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=23.84s)]
*  Democratic Senator Cory Booker has attracted tens of thousands of viewers on the live stream [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=25.2s)]
*  of his filibuster speech in which he's filibustering no legislation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=33.36s)]
*  But you seem to have had some experience with this change. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=40.0s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, I'm gonna tell you in a second how many likes he got on TikTok, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=43.36s)]
*  which is amazing. But I also wanna tell you a little bit about the history of the filibuster. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=47.28s)]
*  The guy whose record he's about to break did something amazing and something terrible, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=52.080000000000005s)]
*  but I'll get to all that. And by the way- [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  And gross. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  And gross, yes. And Booker has a buddy throughout this entire thing and why is he his filibuster [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=60.32000000000001s)]
*  buddy? I'll explain that too. So it's a really interesting story. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=67.12s)]
*  Okay, so as I mentioned, Cory Booker isn't filibustering a bill. There's no legislation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  or specific legislation that he's filibustering. He's essentially giving this impassioned speech. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=75.04s)]
*  And by the way, as we speak right now, the speech is continuing. He's still doing it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=81.12s)]
*  It's been going on for 23 hours. He's basically doing this in protest of President Donald Trump [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  and his administration's policies. So Booker began this filibuster speech at 7 PM Eastern time on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=92.4s)]
*  Monday night and vowed to speak continuously for as long as he can, as long as his body can handle [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  it. So as of 2 PM Eastern time today, Tuesday, he was taking breaks by essentially yielding to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=105.28s)]
*  questions, questions from his colleagues. Around 52,000 people were actually watching his [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  live stream by early afternoon today. Now Booker's speech took aim at President Trump, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=118.88s)]
*  White House senior advisor Elon Musk, and policies he says show a complete disregard for the rule of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=123.84s)]
*  law, the Constitution, and the needs of the American people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=129.92s)]
*  And he covered a wide range of topics as well, including healthcare, social security, immigration, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=133.92s)]
*  the economy, public education, free speech, and foreign policy. So based on the reporting so far, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=139.2s)]
*  and based on what I've seen from his speech, it seems as though he is in fact focusing on [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=145.2s)]
*  political issues, things that the Trump administration has done. In previous filibusters, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=149.2s)]
*  because of how long it takes, you kind of run out of things to talk about. So you literally have [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=154.16s)]
*  examples of members of Congress reading from a child's book or stuff like that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=158.72s)]
*  Now in his intro, Booker declared that in just 71 days, the president has inflicted harm after harm [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=163.28s)]
*  on America's or American safety, financial stability, the foundations of our democracy, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=169.76s)]
*  and any sense of common decency. These are not normal times in our nation, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=175.6s)]
*  and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=180.8s)]
*  So in the 15th hour, he said that he still had fuel in the tank. He was still going strong, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=185.04s)]
*  and to be sure, he's now in his 23rd hour and he's still going strong. About 16 hours and 24 [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=190.56s)]
*  minutes in, Booker looked at the time and said, we are way behind the schedule of where we wanted [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=196.56s)]
*  to be at this point, but he didn't immediately move to wrap things up. And so to obey my staff, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=202.96s)]
*  as senators are told to do, I want to move quickly to housing issues. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=209.36s)]
*  So filibusters, by the way, I'm sure you all know, are supposed to essentially block or delay [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=214.16s)]
*  legislation. And this is how traditional filibusters are done. In the Senate, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=221.6s)]
*  they have the legislative filibuster, which requires 60 out of 100 senators to vote in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=226.64s)]
*  favor of legislation in order for it to pass. That's called a legislative filibuster. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=232.08s)]
*  The old school filibuster is what Cory Booker is doing here, where he's just speaking endlessly. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=236.08s)]
*  In this case, not to block any legislation, but in order to get some attention as he's protesting [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=242.96s)]
*  some of what the Trump administration has been up to. So look, unless special rules are in effect, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=249.44s)]
*  and in this case they're not, the Senate rules for filibuster are as follows. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=255.52s)]
*  So a senator who has been recognized by the presiding officer can speak for as long as they [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  wish. And they cannot be forced to cede the floor or interrupted without the speaker's consent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=264.4s)]
*  But there are some rules for the speaker as well. The senator must remain standing at all times. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=271.12s)]
*  And they must speak continuously more or less. So Booker took some questions from more than a dozen [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  Democratic senators who participated in the proceedings throughout the day. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  And we're gonna get to the record holder in just a minute, but I wanna stop [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=287.2s)]
*  for you to chime in, Cenk. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=290.64s)]
*  Yeah, so first on his filibuster buddy, it's Chris Murphy from Connecticut. Chris Murphy did [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  a 15 hour filibuster earlier, not in this administration, but in our first one. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=297.2s)]
*  And Booker stayed with him throughout. So just as support in the chamber. And this time Murphy has [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=303.28s)]
*  stayed with Booker throughout to ask my question every once in a while to provide support. Okay, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  I love that. That's really nice. They should do a buddy cop movie later. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=316.96s)]
*  Okay, but it's sweet. It's a beautiful thing. Okay, I like that he's fighting back. That's a [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=321.76s)]
*  good thing. So let me give you the upsides and downsides, right? And I like that he's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=326.96s)]
*  at least getting media attention for these problematic things that the Trump administration [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  and Elon Musk are doing. So if you wanted them to get media attention and fight back, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=335.52s)]
*  at least you've got that, right? So definitely better than nothing, way, way better than nothing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=339.67999999999995s)]
*  Okay, now having said that, it really is about nothing. It's about everything and nothing at [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=345.2s)]
*  the same time. So it's not about a bill. It's not trying to stop a bill. It's not trying to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=351.12s)]
*  stop a nomination. And I'll take it as long as when it's time to stop a bill, they also filibuster, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=355.68s)]
*  right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=364.24s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=364.56s)]
*  And so as we just saw a little while ago, there's a continuing resolution that's basically [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=365.44s)]
*  the, to continue the budget, right? And instead of stopping it, it had tons of egregious things we [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=370.48s)]
*  do not agree with. Nine Democrats voted with Trump. Not only did they not filibuster, they [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=376.88s)]
*  didn't block it, they voted with him, right? So when money's on the line, the Democrats [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  historically have said, golly gee, there was nothing we could do. A filibuster, I've never [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=388.16s)]
*  heard of it. Did they pass a multi-trillion dollar tax cut for the rich who are also our donors? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=395.04s)]
*  Again. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  There was nothing we could do. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=401.76000000000005s)]
*  There was nothing we could do. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  Right, and that's the Democrats. So look, they're getting caught though. Trump's getting [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=406.0s)]
*  caught by his own side. The Democrats are getting caught by their own side. We're in a different [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  media ecosystem now. So okay, you do this grandstanding and I'm with you and I'll support it [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  as long as you do it when things are on the line and it's real. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=421.12s)]
*  And I haven't seen that from Democrats. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=424.56s)]
*  Right, yeah, that's a really good point. I actually have the exact same take on you [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=426.48s)]
*  on this story because at first I was like, what is this? I mean, this is just theater [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=431.2s)]
*  and I'm sick of theater. However, you also kind of have to take into consideration that at this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=435.44s)]
*  current moment, Democrats really don't have much power in Congress, right? It's not like they're [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=440.32s)]
*  able to pass their preferred legislation. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  And so everything that they do to fight Trump is gonna be theater. But it could be very useful [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  in getting a message across. Now in this case, you're right. This filibuster is about nothing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=456.56s)]
*  and everything all at once. So there isn't really a narrow, clear message here. If he does this in [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  regard to legislation that is not at all what the Democrats want. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=469.12s)]
*  That you wanna fight back against the Trump administration over something that the most [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=474.4s)]
*  American people would be in favor of you fighting back against, like cuts to social security or [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=478.96s)]
*  Medicaid or something like that. Great, I think that would be far more effective. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=483.12s)]
*  But look, my whole point is this takes a lot of effort. This isn't something like a lazy [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=486.64s)]
*  politician would do. So I'm gonna give him credit because it's something, right? He's trying. He got [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  caught trying, okay? Well, yeah, that's true. That's true. Look, I'm super conflicted about [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=497.04s)]
*  it. Now I'll give you the opposite case again, which is since there's nothing on the line, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=501.20000000000005s)]
*  it is a classic Democratic symbolic move, right? And we've had a lot of symbols from the Democrats, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  tons and tons of symbols. I'm tired of the symbols. Give me the meat. Give me the actual substance, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=512.72s)]
*  right? Let me see you block Medicaid cuts. Let me see you block tax cuts for the rich. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  Let me see you block corporate tax cuts. So I haven't seen it yet. And the second problem [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=523.52s)]
*  with doing filibuster on everything and everything is that it dissipates your message. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=528.24s)]
*  So whereas if you're doing it to prevent them from cutting Medicaid, you can stay like a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=532.72s)]
*  laser beam on that. And you can focus on that. Or if you just picked something like, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=537.68s)]
*  hey, they're doing cuts to social security. We already authorized spending money on those offices. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  What he's doing is unconstitutional. And you find a way to make that this central issue [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  and focus on their cuts to social security. That'll be even better. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=552.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=556.32s)]
*  So it's a start, but there are ways to make it significantly better. But there is one place [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=556.96s)]
*  where he's gotten tremendous success. On TikTok, he has now accumulated 175 million likes. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=561.9200000000001s)]
*  It's China. China's doing this. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=569.84s)]
*  Yeah, but that's part of why he did it, right? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=571.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=574.08s)]
*  And as one of our members says, now he'll get to brag about it for the rest of his life. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=574.4s)]
*  He probably will, yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=578.48s)]
*  Yeah, and he's definitely gonna pass trauma therapy. He's not gonna come to 24 hours and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=579.28s)]
*  17 minutes and stop. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=582.56s)]
*  Hold, because I haven't even gotten to Strum Thurmond. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=583.76s)]
*  Okay, well, I've got thoughts on him too. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=586.8s)]
*  Well, so do I. So let's talk about the record holder for the longest filibuster. Because [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=588.64s)]
*  it's very likely that Cory Booker will pass the record, considering how far he's gone already. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=595.8399999999999s)]
*  But the record holder for the longest filibuster speech as we speak at this moment, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=602.56s)]
*  okay, in the Senate was Strum Thurmond of South Carolina back in 1957. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=607.6s)]
*  So he spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes in opposition of the Civil Rights Act. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=614.32s)]
*  Gross, but get a load of this. Thurmond sustained himself with diced pumpernickel [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=620.96s)]
*  and bits of cooked hamburger. But why? Why did he have to eat that? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=628.16s)]
*  Why do you have to eat chopped up little food when you're doing your filibuster? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=636.8s)]
*  No, I get it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=638.0799999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=638.88s)]
*  Because look, you're gonna get hungry. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=639.3599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=641.3599999999999s)]
*  But you're also gonna need to relieve yourself at some point. So you gotta keep a full stomach, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=642.16s)]
*  but an empty bladder. And so you eat little pieces of food so you don't get overly full, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=647.52s)]
*  hence the chopped burger and pumpernickel. And he also drank orange juice, okay? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=653.92s)]
*  Dude, the 50s were weird when it came to diet. I gotta keep it real, all right? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=658.0s)]
*  A lot of mayo, a lot of jello. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=662.24s)]
*  Because the thing about it, Cory Booker is now standing for almost 24 hours straight. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=664.0s)]
*  So can't go to the bathroom, etc. So he's in a different situation. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=668.72s)]
*  You want me to tell you the gross fact yet? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=672.88s)]
*  No, no, I'm not done. I'm not done. By the way, I like that they had to specify cooked hamburger. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=674.32s)]
*  Yeah, of course it was cooked hamburger. Anyway, and sips of orange juice, as Cenk mentions, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=679.2800000000001s)]
*  his aides set up a bucket- [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  That's, there you go. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=687.2800000000001s)]
*  In the cloakroom so he could keep a foot on the Senate floor if he needed to relieve himself. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=688.4000000000001s)]
*  But what's amazing is that no reporters told us, did he relieve himself? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=695.44s)]
*  I mean, he did it for, I mean, you're really gonna hold it for over 24 hours? That's impossible. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  And it was back in 1957, so no C-span at the time. So I guess we'll never know. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=706.0s)]
*  There's a second gross thing about Strom Thurman's filibuster there. It was to prevent voting rights [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  for African Americans. Yeah, super gross. By the way, did you know that they use the filibuster? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=718.16s)]
*  The cherished tradition of the Senate was in the beginning used almost exclusively for blocking [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  civil rights for African Americans and oftentimes used to block anti-lynching laws. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=730.0799999999999s)]
*  Gross. Okay, so the filibuster has an awful history. It's a terrible thing overall. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=736.7199999999999s)]
*  And I'm always principled and not gonna switch my mind based on the administration. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=742.8s)]
*  I don't think it should exist. I think that it should be a majority vote in the Senate. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  They can't get anything done because of it. And then at least the nonsense things about [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=752.88s)]
*  parliamentarians, etc. But if you're gonna have the filibuster rule, you should make them actually [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=756.64s)]
*  do it every time, whether it's a Democrat or a Republican. You wanna block the bill. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  Mitch McConnell started this way back in the day under Obama, where he was like, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  you know what, I don't wanna stand. I just wanna block hundreds of bills [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=770.56s)]
*  without actually going through the rigmarole. And Harry Reid was like, okay, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=774.8s)]
*  you can do whatever you want. And then they started blocking all of Obama's bills that way. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=778.24s)]
*  And so no, if you're gonna do a filibuster, you should do it just like this. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=782.64s)]
*  And Cory Booker just showed you how. Okay. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=786.0s)]
*  We wanna see you pee in a bucket, okay? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't really wanna see that. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  No, we don't. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=791.12s)]
*  But so I'll just end on the same thing, which is thank you, Cory Booker. Please do it when it counts. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRzgskz8uHI&t=792.8s)]
