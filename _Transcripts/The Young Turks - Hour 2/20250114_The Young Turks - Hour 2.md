"Mayor Adams stopped to get his eyebrows ‚Äúthreaded‚Äù Friday while on a tour of a notorious Queens street he aimed to show had been ‚Äúcleaned up‚Äù of rampant prostitution and illegal merchants.

‚ÄúI look even better looking than I did when I walked in,‚Äù Adams said, while glimpsing in a mirror at Manat beauty salon in Jackson Heights.

Hizzoner was doing a walk-through of the once-crime-infested stretch known as the ‚ÄúMarket of Sweethearts‚Äù on Roosevelt Avenue, between 95th and 103rd streets, when he popped into the salon for the hair-raising makeover."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Eric Adams' Most BIZARRE Press Conference
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs)
*  We got to talk about Eric Adams, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=0.0s)]
*  mayor of New York. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=1.76s)]
*  He's just a weird guy. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=3.68s)]
*  They are the reason why they're [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=4.88s)]
*  saying these bars are employing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=6.3s)]
*  them as they call it dollar girls. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=7.8s)]
*  So basically they're the ones [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=9.84s)]
*  who dance with them for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  a couple of dollars. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=12.32s)]
*  And then that's how they're. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=13.48s)]
*  You just watched footage of the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=17.68s)]
*  mayor of a major city, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=20.16s)]
*  New York City, taking interview [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=22.04s)]
*  questions from reporters as he's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=24.6s)]
*  getting his eyebrows threaded. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=27.2s)]
*  Now, Adams was apparently doing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=30.16s)]
*  a tour. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=32.16s)]
*  This is of course Mayor Eric Adams [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=32.72s)]
*  who's in battle, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=34.56s)]
*  who's facing serious criminal [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=35.56s)]
*  investigations, was apparently [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=37.24s)]
*  doing a tour of an area in Queens [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=39.32s)]
*  known as the Market of Sweethearts. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=41.24s)]
*  And it's known for that due to its [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=44.0s)]
*  rampant open air prostitution and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=45.92s)]
*  illegal vendors. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=47.92s)]
*  Now back in 2023, Adams promised [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=49.16s)]
*  that he was going to clean up that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=51.44s)]
*  area and he described that area as [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=53.6s)]
*  filthy, so a recent police crackdown [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=56.04s)]
*  in the area yielded a whopping [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=58.88s)]
*  891 arrests during a roughly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=60.92s)]
*  two month period, 118 of which [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  were prostitution related. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=65.68s)]
*  And that's according to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=68.12s)]
*  the mayor's office. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=69.48s)]
*  In October, Governor Kathy Hochul [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=70.72s)]
*  also deployed state troopers to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=73.0s)]
*  help take control of the area. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  I just feel like it would be way [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  better to legalize and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  regulate prostitution in my opinion. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=81.08s)]
*  It's never going to go away. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=84.2s)]
*  It's as old as it is, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=86.12s)]
*  it's as old as time that profession, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=87.68s)]
*  that line of work has been around [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=90.28s)]
*  forever. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  And so in order to keep people [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  safe, including the sex workers [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=95.16s)]
*  themselves, I think that it should [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=97.28s)]
*  be regulated, there should be [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=99.68s)]
*  designated areas and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=101.72s)]
*  places where people can go if [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=103.08s)]
*  that's what they're looking for. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=104.92s)]
*  But unfortunately, that is not [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=107.68s)]
*  the avenue that our policymakers [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  have gone in. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=112.12s)]
*  In fact, they just allow things to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=113.12s)]
*  fester and then they crack down by [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=115.76s)]
*  using police. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=118.4s)]
*  Now, during his trip there on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=119.4s)]
*  Friday to show off his alleged [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=121.36s)]
*  success, he decided to pop into [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=123.4s)]
*  Monop Beauty Salon in Jackson [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  Heights to get his eyebrows [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=127.76s)]
*  threaded. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=129.6s)]
*  So I don't know how familiar our [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=131.2s)]
*  largely male audience is with [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=133.16s)]
*  eyebrow threading, but it's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=135.0s)]
*  literally using a piece of thread [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=136.88s)]
*  to pluck unwanted eyebrow hair from [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=138.96s)]
*  someone's face, okay? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=141.12s)]
*  So that's what it is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=142.68s)]
*  Okay, so that's what it is. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=144.28s)]
*  Let's take a photo. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's look at a photo of it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  There it is. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  I find eyebrow threading to be [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  superfluous. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=152.44s)]
*  I just think that that method is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=153.44s)]
*  unnecessary. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=155.8s)]
*  People love it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=157.52s)]
*  Do you boo, I'm not going to ban [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=158.68s)]
*  it, I will allow it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  But I would rather if I'm going to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=161.56s)]
*  do that, I'm just going to pluck [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=162.96s)]
*  my hair or maybe do a little wax [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=164.24s)]
*  situation, but my eyebrows are [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  perfect on their own, so [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't really need to do much. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=168.24s)]
*  Anyway, Cenk, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=169.44s)]
*  what are your thoughts? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  Please, my eyebrows certainly could [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=171.16s)]
*  use it probably, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  plenty of things to pluck there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=175.76s)]
*  But I've literally never heard of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=179.4s)]
*  this thing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=181.76s)]
*  I went my whole life without ever [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  hearing of eyebrow threading. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=186.4s)]
*  And I'm still not sure how they use [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=189.0s)]
*  the floss to remove the hair. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=190.84s)]
*  I just don't- [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=192.84s)]
*  They use thread, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=193.44s)]
*  they don't use dental floss, Cenk. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=194.32s)]
*  Crazy, you crazy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=197.44s)]
*  Do you do anything to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=199.36s)]
*  your eyebrows? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=200.24s)]
*  Do you do a shave or [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=201.52s)]
*  anything like that? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=202.8s)]
*  Yeah, either my wife or the, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=204.16s)]
*  I was going to say the barber, and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=205.88s)]
*  oftentimes it is the barber, will, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=208.08s)]
*  they'll say, hey, do you want me to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=210.36s)]
*  do your eyebrows because they're [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=212.32s)]
*  usually out of control and up here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=214.16s)]
*  And I'll say, yeah, sure, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=216.12s)]
*  definitely, but they never use [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=217.72s)]
*  floss. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=219.76s)]
*  He also got a little head massage [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=222.52s)]
*  and some moisturization. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=225.0s)]
*  So I have two things here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=228.6s)]
*  Number one, I'm never going to say [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=229.88s)]
*  no to a head massage. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=232.24s)]
*  Head massage is God's gift to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=233.92s)]
*  humanity, and so [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=236.32s)]
*  can't criticize the brother for [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=237.44s)]
*  that one. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=239.96s)]
*  Let him go, let him go, okay? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=240.64s)]
*  And so second of all, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=244.28s)]
*  I can beat this story. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=245.68s)]
*  When I was out in Miami, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=249.0s)]
*  I was trying to get a job on air. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=250.76s)]
*  And I got kind of lucky, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  the guy reviewing my resume, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=255.64s)]
*  who was the head of the station, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=257.56s)]
*  got to my credentials on education. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=259.64000000000004s)]
*  And he's like, you went to Wharton [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  undergrad at Columbia Law School? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  No, you didn't, you're a liar. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=265.0s)]
*  I was like, do people lie about [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=266.32000000000005s)]
*  that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  And so I was like, no, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm not a liar. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=269.8s)]
*  He said, if you could prove it, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=270.88s)]
*  I'll give you the job here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  And I was like, that's amazing, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  I'll see you tomorrow, and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=275.32000000000005s)]
*  I'll bring you the transcripts, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=276.56s)]
*  etc., right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=278.04s)]
*  He's like, sure you will, buddy, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  okay? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=280.6s)]
*  But if you can, bring it to me at [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=281.12s)]
*  such and such time, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  at such and such place, and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=283.88s)]
*  I didn't know what that was. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=285.32000000000005s)]
*  I grabbed the transcripts, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  I go over there the next day. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  The dude's getting a pedicure. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=289.32s)]
*  That's my next interview with him, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=293.04s)]
*  and that's how I got my first job [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=295.56s)]
*  on TV. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  While the executive was getting [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  a pedicure. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=301.88s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=303.08s)]
*  I've never seen that either. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=304.04s)]
*  First of all, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=305.44s)]
*  I'm such a barbarian. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=306.12s)]
*  At that point, I didn't even know [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=307.84s)]
*  dudes got pedicures. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=309.56s)]
*  They totally do. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=311.28s)]
*  Look, not only will I allow it, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=312.32s)]
*  I recommend it, I encourage it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=314.6s)]
*  That is a good thing, Cenk, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=317.68s)]
*  that is a good thing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  I just don't want to see a dude's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=320.12s)]
*  feet as I'm about to be [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=322.24s)]
*  interviewed by him. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=323.64s)]
*  That's super strange. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=324.76s)]
*  But enough of you, let's go back to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=326.88s)]
*  me and this story. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=329.0s)]
*  Because apparently, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=330.24s)]
*  according to a free press reporter, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=331.68s)]
*  Olivia Reingold, he was taking [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=334.0s)]
*  questions from reporters. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=336.12s)]
*  And this is when the mayor closed [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=338.0s)]
*  his eyes, got really zen, and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=339.96s)]
*  started responding to questions [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=341.79999999999995s)]
*  with just, mm-hm. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=343.96s)]
*  And then, he paid $4. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=345.36s)]
*  He paid $4 for the treatment, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=348.35999999999996s)]
*  which is, man, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=350.4s)]
*  that is quite a deal. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=351.52s)]
*  That is quite a deal, and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=353.52s)]
*  he paid a nice tip considering [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  the $4 that the treatment cost. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  He paid a $2 tip. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  But look, Adams is kind of known [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=360.44s)]
*  for doing strange, bizarre things. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=362.28s)]
*  And here's what I'm talking about. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=364.55999999999995s)]
*  All I know is all my haters [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=367.15999999999997s)]

*  child carrying in addition to a book. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=390.8s)]
*  Something simple as a crack pipe, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=393.8s)]
*  something simple as a baby doll. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=395.52000000000004s)]
*  Could be just a baby doll, but [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=398.76s)]
*  also it could be a place where you [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55_c45t6IEs&t=400.16s)]
