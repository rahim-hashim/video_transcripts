# THIS IS WHY YOU CAN'T BAN ABORTION
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80)
*  Waller County District Attorney says that abortion happened here at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=0.0s)]
*  Cl√≠nica Waller Latinoamericana. Neighbors were surprised to hear the news. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  You told me they were doing abortions without a license. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=7.44s)]
*  I did not know that. That is why you have to be careful. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=11.6s)]
*  Well, when you have an effective abortion ban in states like Texas, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=16.96s)]
*  people who are unlicensed are going to carry out abortions. Unsafe abortions are gonna happen, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=21.68s)]
*  which is why it's important to keep legal abortions intact so women don't risk their [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=28.0s)]
*  lives to end a pregnancy that they really don't want. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=34.4s)]
*  Now, almost four years after Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a near total abortion ban in the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=37.2s)]
*  state, the state has now filed the first criminal charges against a healthcare provider for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=42.64s)]
*  illegally terminating pregnancies. Now, according to a press release from the Texas Attorney General [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=48.72s)]
*  Ken Paxton, Maria Margarita Rojas, 49-year-old, is alleged to have owned and operated three health [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=53.52s)]
*  clinics in the northwest area of Houston. Paxton accused Rojas of performing abortions in the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  clinics, which are, of course, banned by law in Texas. In court documents, Rojas was accused of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=65.68s)]
*  having attempted an abortion on a woman identified as EG on two separate occasions in March, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  and that she was known by law enforcement to have performed an abortion on another [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=80.64s)]
*  individual earlier this year. Now, in addition to that charge, Rojas, also known as Dr. Maria, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=85.12s)]
*  is also being charged with practicing medicine without a license. She is merely a certified [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=92.88s)]
*  midwife, so she is not licensed to perform abortions. This could have been [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=99.12s)]
*  a complete and utter disaster. Obviously, this is an unsafe situation, but this is what happens [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=103.44s)]
*  when women are desperate and they're living in a state that doesn't allow them to make decisions [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=108.88s)]
*  about their own body. According to the Houston Birth House, a birthing center located in Cyprus, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  she became a certified midwife in the United States back in 2018 and has attended more than 700 [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=119.6s)]
*  births. Now, to be clear, she was a doctor, but a doctor in Peru, which doesn't really qualify here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=127.36s)]
*  Look, I just wanna emphasize, what Rojas did is wrong, not only because of the laws that exist [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=134.48s)]
*  in Texas pertaining to abortion bans, but also because she's not licensed. And so I do think [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=142.08s)]
*  that anyone practicing medicine without a license should be prosecuted. You can't let that stand. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=148.88s)]
*  But again, Waz, I wanna emphasize, you ban abortions. That doesn't mean that women aren't [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=155.36s)]
*  gonna attempt to get abortions anyway, especially poor women who don't have the funds to travel out [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=161.84s)]
*  of state to get an abortion. So women living in poverty are gonna resort to unsafe measures [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=166.24s)]
*  like this in order to terminate a pregnancy. Yeah, this is the key. That's the key point. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=171.52s)]
*  That's why we put abortion laws on the books in the first place. That is the whole point of Roe v [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=177.04s)]
*  Wade. It's the idea that women are going to try to terminate pregnancies. It's important to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=185.28s)]
*  provide an infrastructure where they can do so safely. That's the entire point of the ban, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=194.8s)]
*  I mean, excuse me, of the previous law. Again, in the past, there were people literally [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=201.84s)]
*  in back alleys getting abortions with coat hangers, y'all. I'm not making this up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=208.88s)]
*  This was the paradigm before we, you know what I mean? Basically, the Supreme Court made Roe the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=215.28s)]
*  law of the land. This is why. It's not because people just frivolously wanna do abortions or [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=222.72s)]
*  whatever. There are going to be people that need to or desperately want to terminate their [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=228.72s)]
*  pregnancies, and they're gonna do it by any means necessary. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=234.8s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right about that. Because it's not just about giving birth to a child that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=238.56s)]
*  a mother did not intend to have. It's also about the economic component of bringing a child that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=246.72s)]
*  you're not ready to have into the world. And so these attempts to terminate a pregnancy [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=254.72000000000003s)]
*  in unsafe ways will continue, and there are significant consequences to that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=260.8s)]
*  I wanna go to the very last graphic here, because it notes that the number of women in Texas who [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=264.4s)]
*  died while pregnant during labor or soon after childbirth skyrocketed following the state's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=269.35999999999996s)]
*  2021 ban on abortion care, far outpacing a slower rise in maternal mortality across the nation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=275.44s)]
*  From 2019 to 2022, the rate of maternal mortality cases in Texas rose by 56% [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=282.56s)]
*  compared with just 11% nationwide during the same period. And my guess is the increase nationwide [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=289.52s)]
*  has to do with the fact that there are other red states that have effectively banned abortion as [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=296.16s)]
*  well. And so this is just absolutely disastrous. But of course, Ken Paxton and the other officials [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=300.8s)]
*  in Texas are learning all the wrong lessons from this. Pursuing prosecution of the providers as [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=307.6s)]
*  opposed to maybe rethinking the damage that's being done by their draconian laws pertaining [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=313.6s)]
*  to abortion. Now, Rojas wasn't the only person who was arrested. Someone working with her, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  a Cuban national who allegedly is in the country illegally, was also arrested. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=325.12s)]
*  She faces potentially 20 years behind bars for performing illegal abortions, allegedly. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  And so that has to be adjudicated through court. We'll see how that plays out, but not a good story. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=337.6s)]
*  And it really does draw attention to the extreme measures that some women will go to in order to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=342.56s)]
*  terminate a pregnancy in a state that has banned it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaq3Eo3ul80&t=347.68s)]
