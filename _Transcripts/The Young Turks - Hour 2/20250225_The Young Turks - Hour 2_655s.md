The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Kash Patel's FBI Launches Investigation Into Trump's Number One Enemy
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw)
*  FBI Director Cash Patel has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=0.0s)]
*  officially launched an investigation [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=2.24s)]
*  into former head of the FBI, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=5.28s)]
*  James Comey, over the bureau's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=7.54s)]
*  alleged surveillance of the 2016 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=10.28s)]
*  Trump campaign. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=13.18s)]
*  Now this was a story that broke [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=15.84s)]
*  over at the Washington Times. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=17.66s)]
*  This is a conservative publication, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=19.5s)]
*  but they found that apparently [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=22.36s)]
*  there was some sort of FBI whistle [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=24.6s)]
*  blower who blew the whistle on [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=27.12s)]
*  launching a separate investigation, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  meaning separate from the Russia [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=33.0s)]
*  collusion investigation, having to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=35.32s)]
*  do with honeypots, two honeypots, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  who were allegedly attempting to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=40.86s)]
*  entrap Donald Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=43.52s)]
*  Yeah, super skeptical, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=46.24s)]
*  red flag, red flag. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  I'm not skeptical. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=53.44s)]
*  I'm open to hearing what [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=54.36s)]
*  the evidence is. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=56.32s)]
*  I think the bigger issue is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=58.72s)]
*  politicizing government agencies [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=60.18s)]
*  against political opponents. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=62.12s)]
*  No, I think it's a disaster. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=64.16s)]
*  So look, you're telling me the guy [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=65.96s)]
*  that Trump hates the most, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=68.52s)]
*  James Comey, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=70.6s)]
*  Why does he hate James Comey? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=72.56s)]
*  Because James Comey started [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=73.72s)]
*  the Russia investigation against [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=74.92s)]
*  him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=76.4s)]
*  True. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=76.92s)]
*  So he's never going to let that go. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=77.48s)]
*  But he also kind of screwed over [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=81.08s)]
*  But he doesn't care about that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=81.88s)]
*  And he just cares, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=83.56s)]
*  good to Trump, not good to Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=84.8s)]
*  He was not good to Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=87.24s)]
*  He didn't let me do this, okay? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  And so he hates James Comey. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=90.48s)]
*  Look, if you're MAGA and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=93.2s)]
*  you don't like me saying, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=94.52s)]
*  doing Trump's voice, and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=95.84s)]
*  you think Comey's a bad guy and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=97.2s)]
*  Trump's a good guy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=98.64s)]
*  But can we at least acknowledge [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=100.0s)]
*  Trump hates James Comey, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=101.84s)]
*  obviously, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  He does. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  Has a giant, giant vendetta against [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  James Comey. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=107.12s)]
*  What did Cash Patel, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=108.28s)]
*  what was he famous for? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=109.4s)]
*  For having an enemies list that he [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=110.56s)]
*  would target. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  Of course, he goes to his [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  confirmation hearings, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  lies through his ass, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=116.14s)]
*  otherwise known as his mouth. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  And yeah, I won't do an enemies [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=119.08s)]
*  list, I won't go after our [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  political enemies and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  the people that Donald Trump hates. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  What's the very first thing he does? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  Goes after one of, not one of the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  person that Donald Trump hates the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=130.68s)]
*  most, and then comes to me with [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=132.92s)]
*  some absurd plot of honeypot [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  agents trying to what, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=137.24s)]
*  sleep with Donald Trump? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=139.0s)]
*  FBI agents were sent to sleep with [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=141.2s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=143.4s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=144.6s)]
*  Get out of here, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=145.24s)]
*  there's no chance that's true. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=146.0s)]
*  I'd be shocked, I'll fall out of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=147.44s)]
*  this chair if that story's true. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=148.92s)]
*  There's no, first of all, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=150.68s)]
*  they're not even that competent. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=151.68s)]
*  Second of all, you're going to tell [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=153.04s)]
*  an FBI agent to go sleep with [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=154.52s)]
*  a candidate? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=155.8s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=156.64s)]
*  That doesn't happen in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=157.48s)]
*  America these days. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=158.28s)]
*  Guys, you're thinking 1950s, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=159.36s)]
*  60s, whatever, like done, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=161.12s)]
*  James Bond crap. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=162.72s)]
*  This isn't it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=164.28s)]
*  They're largely bureaucrats. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=165.28s)]
*  If you told a female FBI agent to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=167.32s)]
*  go sleep with someone, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=169.56s)]
*  you'd get fired and sued. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=171.12s)]
*  Okay, let me give you the details [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=173.12s)]
*  as they are currently reported by [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  the Washington Times. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=177.56s)]
*  And then we'll talk a little bit [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=178.92s)]
*  about whether it's even illegal to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=180.56s)]
*  use honeypots. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=182.32s)]
*  Okay, yeah, we'll talk about it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=183.12s)]
*  So, all right, so again, this was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=184.88s)]

*  I mean, that's all we know so far. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=290.76s)]
*  No chance it's true. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=294.24s)]
*  Okay, I don't know if it's true or [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=295.32s)]
*  not. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=297.0s)]
*  Honestly, I don't even care if it's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=297.5s)]
*  true or not. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=299.28s)]
*  What I care about is politicizing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=299.84s)]
*  government agencies to essentially [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=301.96s)]
*  serve as personal hit men to go [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=304.28s)]
*  after your political opponents. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=306.12s)]
*  You know what this tells me? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=307.96s)]
*  This story tells me that James Comey [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  is spick and span. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=310.48s)]
*  And I'll tell you why. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=311.92s)]
*  Because when you target someone, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=312.96s)]
*  what they do is they dig. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=315.36s)]
*  By the way, both sides do it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=317.64s)]
*  Democrats love to character [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  assassinate people. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  Just look, I can give you [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=322.2s)]
*  a laundry list. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=323.72s)]
*  But Republicans do it to their own, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=324.56s)]
*  Matt Gaetz, Cawthorn, etc. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  They do it to Eliot Spitzer. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=329.68s)]
*  We've went through this a million [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=332.6s)]
*  times about how they target people. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=334.08s)]
*  So when they targeted Comey, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  which obviously they did, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=337.76s)]
*  they must have gone through all of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=339.52s)]
*  this stuff. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=341.52s)]
*  Man, we can't find any sex on him [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=342.24s)]
*  because that's the number one thing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=343.68s)]
*  they look for. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=345.12s)]
*  Damn it, we can't find anything [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=345.92s)]
*  illegal on him. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=347.16s)]
*  I got an idea. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  Why don't we invent this fantastical [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=348.88s)]
*  story about undercover agents that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=351.0s)]
*  were so undercover, we'll never be [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  able to find them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=355.28s)]
*  But they were going to go and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=356.52s)]
*  seduce Donald Trump and say to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=357.88s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia to him or [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=359.52s)]
*  whatever nonsense that they're [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  making up here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=363.2s)]
*  So there's no chance this is true. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=364.32s)]
*  And it means James Comey [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=366.28s)]
*  apparently didn't do anything [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=367.44s)]
*  illegal his whole life. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  So congratulations, Comey, that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  they had to invent this crap to go [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=371.28s)]
*  after him. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=372.76s)]
*  So and by the way, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  if they arrest James Comey, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  that's it, it's begun. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=376.64s)]
*  Okay, and by the way, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=378.68s)]
*  if nobody says anything because [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=379.48s)]
*  the Democrats also hate James Comey, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=380.64s)]
*  because he did screw over Hillary [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  Clinton right before the election. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=383.56s)]
*  Well, then you're going to open [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=385.56s)]
*  the door. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=386.32s)]
*  Then you open the door, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=386.84s)]
*  they're going to say, yeah, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=387.56s)]
*  I found out that the next person, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=389.32s)]
*  Liz Cheney or whoever, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=391.36s)]
*  she was involved in something else [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=392.88s)]
*  where she found a literal honeypot [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  and took it from someone's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=397.12s)]
*  backyard. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=398.84s)]
*  Okay, so now we're just arresting [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=399.92s)]
*  political opponents. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=401.8s)]
*  So that's the era we're in. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=403.48s)]
*  No one's been arrested. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  And look, if Comey is indeed [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=406.64s)]
*  spick and span, then I mean, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=408.2s)]
*  he's, look, again, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=409.88s)]
*  let me reiterate. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=411.08s)]
*  The biggest problem here is [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=412.44s)]
*  weaponizing federal government [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  agencies to carry out these like [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=416.24s)]
*  hit jobs on political opponents. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  I have a huge problem with that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=420.28s)]
*  And if Republicans think it's [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  totally fine right now, because [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  it's happening on behalf of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=425.52s)]
*  a Republican president. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=427.0s)]
*  Well, Democrats are eventually [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=428.96s)]
*  going to be in power. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=430.28s)]
*  And are you going to be happy with [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=431.32s)]
*  them doing politically motivated [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=432.64s)]
*  investigations using federal [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=434.2s)]
*  government agencies in this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=435.76000000000005s)]
*  weaponized way? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=437.16s)]
*  That's wrong. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=438.0s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=438.92s)]
*  So I've taken tons of crap for [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  saying no, MAGA, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  huge portions of them are actually [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=443.0s)]
*  anti-war, are populist in different [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=445.04s)]
*  ways that I've explained. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=447.40000000000003s)]
*  In this case, I'm being honest with [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  you just as much. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=452.0s)]
*  They're off the charts. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=453.88000000000005s)]
*  They think, for sure, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=455.48s)]
*  Comey did it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't need any stinking evidence. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=457.92s)]
*  Comey targeted Trump, it's over. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=459.92s)]
*  We hate him. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=463.12s)]
*  I'm so glad. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  I hope they arrest him and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=464.92s)]
*  put him in Gitmo. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=466.08s)]
*  And I don't need any [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=467.44s)]
*  goddamn evidence. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=468.28s)]
*  I already know it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=469.24s)]
*  And then when you say to them, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=470.24s)]

*  by the way, okay, look, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=496.8s)]
*  we can get back into whether Biden [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=498.0s)]

*  Okay, we can get back into that. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=510.72s)]
*  But even if you believe Biden did [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=512.36s)]
*  it and it was terrible to Trump, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=514.28s)]
*  you think strike back is a thing [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlFnfTmmLAw&t=516.24s)]
