The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Judge Blocks The FIRST Immigration Change Trump Instituted
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A)
*  A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's move to essentially carry out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=0.0s)]
*  immigration raids at places of worship. Something that was announced early on in Trump's second [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=6.48s)]
*  term. In fact, a day after he was inaugurated, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden era [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=12.88s)]
*  directive that prevented immigration enforcement in places of worship. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=19.76s)]
*  However, there was a lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward in regard to that Department of Homeland [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  Security guidance and announcement that they would be doing immigration raids at places of worship. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=32.8s)]
*  And a federal judge has sided with the plaintiffs in this case. They're arguing that, look, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=39.68s)]
*  allowing federal agents to indiscriminately target migrants is in violation of religious [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=46.4s)]
*  freedom and expression rights. And in this case, the judge agreed. So let's hear from Theodore [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=52.56s)]
*  Chang. That is the US district judge who blocked DHS on this matter. Here's what he had to say [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=59.84s)]
*  in his decision. Armed law enforcement officers operating in or at places of worship pursuant to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=66.8s)]
*  the 2025 policy will adversely affect the ability of Quakers and seeks to follow their religious [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  beliefs or worship freely. He also argues that given that each of plaintiffs has religious beliefs [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=82.32s)]
*  that cause them to welcome and serve immigrants, has significant immigrant membership or operates [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  in communities with significant immigrant populations and has not disavowed that they [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=98.32s)]
*  will continue to serve immigrants both with and without legal status. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=105.44s)]
*  It is reasonable to expect the Department of Homeland Security will direct immigration [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=110.32s)]
*  enforcement toward plaintiffs specifically. And so the judge added that although the plaintiffs [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=115.27999999999999s)]
*  each had different religious views, that didn't really matter in this case because all were in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=121.28s)]
*  agreement that being welcoming to immigrants was a central part of their faith, central part of the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=126.8s)]
*  practice of their faith. Yeah, so I totally agree with this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=135.12s)]
*  And so I'm curious whether you were gonna think that my view is extreme. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=139.76s)]
*  I think that even if they have criminals in the church or religious building that the cops should [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=146.56s)]
*  not go in. And so look, I believe that we should not do mass deportations. I love when religious [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=156.16s)]
*  organizations protect immigrants that didn't do anything wrong. I do believe we should send [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=164.4s)]
*  criminal undocumented immigrants back. And I'm an atheist, so I've got no dog in that fight of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  between the religions and stuff. But I believe in the United States Constitution, and we protect [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=178.08s)]
*  religious freedom in these parts. And so if your religion says that you have to be welcoming to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=183.76s)]
*  immigrants and you protect those immigrants, I think the government should have a thou shall [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=188.8s)]
*  not pass at the door of the church, the temple, etc. And by the way, if you're a Christian, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  there is endless quotes in the Bible about Jesus and God being in favor of immigrants, often referred [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=201.28s)]
*  to as strangers. I'll give you one, but there's so many. Deuteronomy 10, 19 said, you shall also [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=207.28s)]
*  love the stranger for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. So that is a core tenet of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=212.16000000000003s)]
*  Christianity, let alone all the other religions. So you could say, hey, yeah, but I don't agree [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=218.16s)]
*  with that in terms of policy here in America, no problem. But when religious leaders do wanna [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=223.68s)]
*  protect people based on their religious faith and beliefs, we've got to let them do that here [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=228.32s)]
*  in America. Yeah, look, I'm also not a believer in institutions of religion, right? Anyway, but [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=233.6s)]
*  my point is that religious liberty is an important part of this country. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  And I deeply respect the religious people, people of faith in this country and want to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=246.4s)]
*  protect their ability to practice their faith. And so I think that this argument is a good [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=252.4s)]
*  argument to bring forward in regard to how what DHS is intending to do is wrong. Because [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  just think about what that would look like, right? You have places of worship being raided by [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=266.16s)]
*  ICE. That's going to interrupt the religious practices of everyone who's in that place of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=271.04s)]
*  worship, right? And so to your point about someone who might be an undocumented immigrant who was [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=279.68s)]
*  suspected of committing terrible crimes, like violent crimes or things like that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=286.16s)]
*  I don't think you need to necessarily raid a place of worship in order to arrest them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  I think ICE can either wait outside and arrest that individual after they have their religious [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=294.96s)]
*  practices or whatever service is done. Invading and interrupting religious [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=302.48s)]
*  church or whatever, it's just not the right way to go. I don't think it's a good way to go. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=312.48s)]
*  So I don't know if the Trump administration is going to appeal this decision or challenge it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=315.76s)]
*  But notice how DHS also said that schools might be raided. This has nothing to do with the schools. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=320.96s)]
*  They specifically block the order as it pertains to places of worship. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=328.56s)]
*  Yeah, so if you're on the side of protecting immigrants, don't get too excited. This is very [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  specific, right? And then if you're on the side of deporting folks, and this is not going to play [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=337.28s)]
*  well, raiding churches and other houses of worship. So if I was on that side, I'd say [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=344.24s)]
*  tread carefully. But it doesn't look like they're treading carefully on anything. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=351.2s)]
*  So if they start knocking down the doors, apparently as they have already to some degree, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=356.24s)]
*  that's why they went to court, knocking down the doors of churches to get in, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=360.88s)]
*  that is going to play awful with the American people. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCxXtZsy1A&t=365.44s)]
