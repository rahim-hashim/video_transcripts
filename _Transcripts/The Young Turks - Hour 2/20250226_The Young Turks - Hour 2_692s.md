The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

*  that any Republicans ever want [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=12.88s)]
*  a governor's race here in Florida. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  She would do better than me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=17.04s)]
*  Okay, look, it does appear like [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=21.28s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=23.68s)]
*  President Donald Trump who is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=26.64s)]
*  backing Byron Donalds in the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=29.06s)]
*  governor's race in Florida might [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=31.22s)]
*  get into another feud and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=33.78s)]
*  it might be delicious. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=35.78s)]
*  Okay, so let's get into the details [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=37.58s)]
*  of what could happen here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=39.62s)]
*  So what are they beefing about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=41.3s)]
*  this time? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=42.94s)]
*  Well, DeSantis' term as Florida's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=43.5s)]
*  governor is up, it ends in 2026. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=46.3s)]
*  So Trump preemptively endorsed [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=48.9s)]
*  Florida representative Byron [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  Donalds for the role before [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=53.14s)]
*  Donald had even announced that he [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  was running, and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=57.18s)]
*  he was running, but [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  he has announced, okay, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  the president wrote last week. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=61.14s)]
*  I am hearing that highly respected [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=63.54s)]
*  Congressman Byron Donalds is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=65.34s)]
*  considering running for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=66.8s)]
*  governor of Florida, a state that I [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=67.96s)]
*  love and one big in 2016, 2020, and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=69.97999999999999s)]
*  2024. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=72.46s)]
*  Byron Donalds would be a truly [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=72.97999999999999s)]
*  great and powerful governor for [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=75.1s)]
*  Florida and should he decide to run, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=77.34s)]
*  will have my complete and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=80.02s)]
*  total endorsement, run Byron, run. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=81.94s)]
*  Now yesterday, Byron Donalds made [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=85.02s)]
*  it official and he did announce [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=87.34s)]
*  that he will be running in that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=89.5s)]
*  gubernatorial race when Sean [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  Hannity asked what Donald's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=93.38000000000001s)]
*  priorities would be as governor. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=95.42s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=97.9s)]
*  First, we have an insurance [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=99.26s)]
*  problem in our state. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=101.14s)]
*  My career in banking insurance and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=102.62s)]
*  in financial services, I want to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=104.86000000000001s)]
*  make sure that we solve this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=106.94s)]
*  problem for the people of Florida. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=108.7s)]
*  And it's going to mean bringing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  every stakeholder to the table [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  because the people of Florida is [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=114.30000000000001s)]
*  what's going to matter. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=116.1s)]
*  We got to solve it, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=117.42s)]
*  we got to stabilize those costs. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=118.33999999999999s)]
*  I want to turn Florida into [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  the financial hub of the world. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=121.82s)]
*  Digital assets has made a home in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=124.06s)]
*  South Florida. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=126.06s)]
*  I want to make sure that we will [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=127.06s)]
*  become the most business friendly [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=128.74s)]
*  state in our country for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=130.74s)]
*  businesses to incorporate in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=132.06s)]
*  our state. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=133.74s)]
*  But then also for the state to take [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=134.46s)]
*  the lead on cryptocurrency and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=136.18s)]
*  digital assets. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=137.74s)]
*  I would even consider having [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  crypto be a part of the state's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=140.14s)]
*  financial portfolio. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=141.74s)]
*  That editorial brought to you by [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=142.9s)]
*  the Washington Post, okay. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it would be allowed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=146.34s)]
*  It would be allowed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  It would 100% be allowed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=148.82s)]
*  So your priority for [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=149.9s)]
*  Florida is crypto. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=151.02s)]
*  By the way, he started off with [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=152.3s)]
*  wanting to do something about [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=154.3s)]
*  the insurance crisis. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=156.06s)]
*  That is a very real crisis, and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm curious to hear what his ideas [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=159.34s)]
*  are. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=161.26s)]
*  But really crypto is the second [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=162.62s)]
*  thing you mentioned for Florida, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=164.22s)]
*  crypto. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=165.66s)]
*  It was the most of what he said, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=166.22s)]
*  just digital currency. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=168.1s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=169.54000000000002s)]
*  just digital currency. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=171.82s)]
*  Pump and dump schemes that rob [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=173.42s)]
*  Americans. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=175.18s)]
*  A new home for a coin. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=175.94s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=178.34s)]
*  Now look, John, whatever you think [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=180.38s)]
*  about Byron Donalds, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=183.06s)]
*  Ron DeSantis not a fan, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=184.7s)]
*  not a fan of Byron Donalds at all. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=186.45999999999998s)]
*  Here's what he said about [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=188.9s)]
*  the congressman on Monday. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=190.5s)]
*  Donald Trump just got into office. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=193.38s)]
*  I want these congressmen focused on [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=195.74s)]
*  enacting his agenda. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=197.78s)]
*  They haven't done very much yet. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=199.42s)]
*  They're not putting his executive [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  orders into place. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  We'll see what they do on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=204.42s)]
*  the spending. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=205.66s)]
*  But we have such a narrow majority [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=206.82s)]
*  that to be trying to campaign other [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=208.62s)]
*  places and missing these votes, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=210.42s)]
*  I think is not something that's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=212.18s)]
*  advisable at all. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=213.98s)]
*  And so the reality is, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=215.18s)]
*  we've achieved victories in Florida. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  We need to start achieving those [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=221.62s)]
*  victories up there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=223.38s)]
*  So I think people look at it and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  say, you got a guy like Byron, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=226.45999999999998s)]
*  he just hasn't been a part of any [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=228.5s)]
*  of the victories that we've had [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=230.5s)]
*  here over the left over [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=232.14s)]
*  these last years. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=233.14s)]
*  He's just not been a part of it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=233.86s)]
*  He's been in other states [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=235.82s)]
*  campaigning doing that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=237.02s)]
*  And that's fine, but okay, well [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=238.54s)]
*  then deliver results up there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=240.26s)]
*  That's what I want to see. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=242.22s)]
*  I want to see them delivering [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=243.18s)]
*  results for the people of Florida. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=244.74s)]
*  We deliver it here all the time for [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=246.62s)]
*  the people of Florida. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=248.7s)]
*  Trump is not going to like that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=252.34s)]
*  He's not going to like that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=254.14s)]
*  Now Byron Donalds was asked to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=255.26s)]
*  respond and he declined to do so. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=256.98s)]
*  And instead talked about Trump's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=259.86s)]
*  endorsement. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=261.7s)]
*  And look, according to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=262.98s)]
*  the New York Times, Ron DeSantis [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=263.98s)]
*  and Byron Donalds used to have [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=265.66s)]
*  a warmer friendly relationship, but [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=267.26s)]
*  they had a falling out after Byron [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=269.38s)]
*  Donalds decided to endorse Donald [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  Trump over Ron DeSantis. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=273.38s)]
*  Now it looks like DeSantis has [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  another gubernatorial candidate in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=277.38s)]
*  mind and that's his wife, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=279.18s)]
*  Casey DeSantis. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=280.58000000000004s)]
*  We're going to get to that in just [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=281.82s)]
*  a minute, but I want to jump in and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=282.98s)]
*  have you respond. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=284.14s)]
*  Which he had referenced earlier. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=285.18s)]
*  I don't think, the things that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=286.86s)]
*  DeSantis says I'm sure will bother [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=289.22s)]
*  Trump, but Trump I'm sure was [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=290.98s)]
*  already ready to napalm DeSantis. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=292.5s)]
*  He didn't care about DeSantis [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=294.54s)]
*  literally at all. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=296.18s)]
*  And I think DeSantis knows that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  DeSantis I guess is in a tough spot [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=300.42s)]
*  because he's sort of like penned in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  between his obvious and I think [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=305.26s)]
*  foolhardy aspiration to once again [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=307.38s)]
*  run for president after Donald [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=309.86s)]
*  Trump's heart pops in his chest. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=311.94s)]
*  And then obviously the stuff with [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=314.26s)]
*  the wife, which we're going to talk [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=315.74s)]
*  about. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=317.18s)]
*  Imagine being like a Florida [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=318.42s)]
*  resident these days. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=320.02s)]
*  You got Byron Donalds who is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=321.3s)]
*  notable because he tried to rewrite [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=323.02s)]
*  the history of segregation and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  slavery or whatever. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=327.06s)]
*  I guess that was fun. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=328.46s)]
*  That was a fun little fantastical [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=329.46s)]
*  trip down memory lane. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=331.74s)]
*  And then DeSantis' wife, why? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  What does any of this have to do [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=336.98s)]
*  with the state and even DeSantis? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=338.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=340.78s)]
*  Yeah, and in fact, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=341.78s)]
*  I actually think her involvement in [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=343.26s)]
*  DeSantis' presidential bid didn't [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  work out so well for him. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=348.5s)]
*  Look, there were a lot of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=350.58000000000004s)]
*  accusations of that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  She wasn't really vocal publicly, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=353.14s)]
*  but apparently she was very engaged [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  behind the scenes and there were [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=356.58000000000004s)]
*  a lot of complaints about that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=357.94s)]
*  But nonetheless, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=359.3s)]
*  DeSantis clearly wants his wife to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=360.3s)]
*  be the victor here, wants his wife [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=362.18s)]
*  to run in that gubernatorial race. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=364.02000000000004s)]
*  Here's what he had to say about [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=365.98s)]
*  the idea of Casey DeSantis running [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=367.66s)]
*  for governor. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=369.62s)]
*  And keep in mind that she hasn't [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=370.62s)]
*  even announced her candidacy yet. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=372.3s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=374.38s)]
*  People ask me all the time about [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  our wonderful First Lady who has [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=378.38s)]
*  done a fantastic job as First Lady [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=380.58000000000004s)]
*  of Florida. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  And there's been a lot of people, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=384.06s)]
*  I was asked on it on Fox the other [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=386.18s)]
*  day about all these people are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=388.22s)]
*  chattering about her running. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=390.38s)]
*  And what I said was, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=393.34000000000003s)]
*  she's never angled for anything, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=394.58000000000004s)]
*  right? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=396.66s)]
*  Because that's just not who she is. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=397.66s)]
*  I mean, she kind of does what she [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=399.14s)]
*  does, but I will tell you this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=400.7s)]
*  You're talking about somebody like [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=403.38s)]
*  her, I won by the biggest margin [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=405.14s)]
*  that any Republicans ever want [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=407.02s)]
*  a governor's race here in Florida. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=408.78s)]
*  She would do better than me, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=411.3s)]
*  there's no question about that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=412.53999999999996s)]
*  That would happen. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=414.26s)]
*  And she's somebody that has, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=415.41999999999996s)]
*  I think, the intestinal fortitude [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=417.38s)]
*  and the dedication to conservative [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=419.86s)]
*  principles that you know anything [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=422.34s)]
*  we've accomplished she'd be able to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=424.86s)]
*  take to the next level. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=427.26s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=430.41999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so look, I'm going to be fair [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=431.06s)]
*  and just note, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=433.26s)]
*  it is very sweet how much he [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=434.26s)]
*  obviously loves his wife, he does. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=436.18s)]
*  But why, what's her vision for [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=439.74s)]
*  Florida, why would she be better? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  There was nothing there to really [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=446.34s)]
*  sell her vision for Floridians, but [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=448.5s)]
*  nonetheless, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=451.02s)]
*  what do Floridians think? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=452.02s)]
*  Well, according to a recent survey [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=454.34s)]
*  by the Public Opinion Research Lab [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=456.3s)]
*  at the University of North Florida, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=458.3s)]
*  the first lady had a 30% favorable [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=460.46s)]
*  rating compared to 22% unfavorable. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=462.58s)]
*  33% though, say that they've never [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  heard of her, which makes sense. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=469.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and Donald's has a 15% [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=471.18s)]
*  approval rating and a 9% disapproval [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=473.7s)]
*  rating with 66% of respondents [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=476.86s)]
*  saying they had never heard of him. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=479.38s)]
*  That is strange. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=483.5s)]
*  strange. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=484.53999999999996s)]
*  During the last primary, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=485.09999999999997s)]
*  he was going on Fox News, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=486.62s)]
*  he was like stumping for Trump. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  And he wasn't one of the highest [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=490.46s)]
*  profile surrogates, but [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=491.7s)]
*  he was definitely a surrogate. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=492.62s)]
*  Well, look, I think everyone who [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  works in political media or [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=495.82s)]
*  is super engaged and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=497.53999999999996s)]
*  paying close attention to what's [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=498.7s)]
*  happening politically in the country [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=500.62s)]
*  makes the mistake of overestimating [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=502.74s)]
*  how most Americans inform themselves [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=504.82s)]
*  on political happenings. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=507.06s)]
*  Most people aren't paying close [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=509.14s)]
*  attention to this stuff. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=510.3s)]
*  They've got mouths to feed, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=511.14s)]
*  jobs to do, they're super busy, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=512.62s)]
*  super overwhelmed, so [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=514.26s)]
*  I don't begrudge them. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=515.38s)]
*  I'm not saying they need to be [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=516.5s)]
*  watching C-SPAN, it's just Byron [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=517.54s)]
*  Donalds goes on Fox News [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=518.74s)]
*  constantly. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=519.62s)]
*  He does, he does. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=520.18s)]
*  He's doing all the culture, war, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=521.18s)]
*  identity politics stuff, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=523.06s)]
*  the same stuff that DeSantis is 100% [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=524.54s)]
*  focused on. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=526.58s)]
*  I felt like that would have bought [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=528.38s)]
*  him something. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=529.42s)]
*  I mean, look, when they say they [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  know who Casey DeSantis is, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=531.58s)]
*  it could be that it's just [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=532.86s)]
*  the last name that's triggered him [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=533.98s)]
*  to be like, I guess it's DeSantis. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=535.26s)]
*  Maybe if it was, hey, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=536.6999999999999s)]
*  what about Casey? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=537.8199999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't know, maybe they [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=538.98s)]
*  wouldn't place it at that point. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=540.26s)]
*  And look, it's easier to have [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=541.78s)]
*  a high favorable rating when, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=543.58s)]
*  why would it be low for most people? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=545.66s)]
*  She's a first lady, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=548.62s)]
*  she hasn't done anything. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=549.5s)]
*  Why would it be [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=551.14s)]
*  a controversial figure? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=551.74s)]
*  So it's a little bit easier for [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=552.7s)]
*  her than for a congressperson. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=554.22s)]
*  That said, I don't understand [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=556.46s)]
*  these people who, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=558.9s)]
*  she's not angling or anything. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=560.5s)]
*  That's what DeSantis says. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=563.22s)]
*  Yeah, right, she's obviously [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=564.58s)]
*  insanely ambitious. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=566.62s)]
*  And the first step, I'm governor. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=568.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm in charge of the entire damn [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=571.54s)]
*  state, one of the biggest states [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=572.9s)]
*  of the country. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=574.1800000000001s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=574.82s)]
*  I don't got time to do any of those [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=575.94s)]
*  lower things, other people who [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=577.3000000000001s)]
*  work their way up and [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=578.7s)]
*  serve the community. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=579.62s)]
*  I don't got time for that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=580.9s)]
*  I want to be governor. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=582.0600000000001s)]
*  Maybe I'll run for [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=582.82s)]
*  president instead, but [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=583.34s)]
*  if not that governor. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=584.1800000000001s)]
*  That's insane to me. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=585.5s)]
*  And why does DeSantis assume that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=586.9s)]
*  just because you're married to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=588.26s)]
*  the person, they're qualified to be [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=589.5s)]
*  governor? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=590.74s)]
*  It's just like with Laura Trump, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=591.62s)]
*  all these people are just trying to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=593.38s)]
*  create these dynasties instantly [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=595.1s)]
*  just based on last name. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=596.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=599.0600000000001s)]
*  So I don't know, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=600.98s)]
*  it's up to Floridians to decide, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=602.3s)]
*  but we'll see what happens. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=604.82s)]
*  And look, several people told [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=607.3s)]
*  Insider that Casey DeSantis is [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=609.54s)]
*  an equal partner, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=612.42s)]
*  a masterful image maker, and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=614.34s)]
*  a powerful confidant to a man at [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=617.22s)]
*  the forefront of GOP politics. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=620.14s)]
*  If there were no Casey, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=623.58s)]
*  there would be no Ron. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=624.9s)]
*  Okay, I'll put some of the blame [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=626.78s)]
*  on her then. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=627.66s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=628.86s)]
*  Also, all that stuff was she's [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=629.62s)]
*  a confidant, an image maker. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=631.54s)]
*  What the hell does any of that have [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=633.86s)]
*  to do with public policy in Florida? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=635.34s)]
*  Yeah, she tells him, hey, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=638.0600000000001s)]
*  here's the thing that they're [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=639.1800000000001s)]
*  really focused on in 4chan. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=640.34s)]
*  You should make this the centerpiece [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=641.74s)]
*  of your campaign. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=642.9s)]
*  Okay, that's good politics. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=643.5400000000001s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=644.34s)]
*  Let's talk the words in her mouth, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=644.84s)]
*  but I agree with you. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=645.86s)]
*  Look, I agree with you. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=646.38s)]
*  Well, if she's driving what he [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=647.4200000000001s)]
*  does and what he does is a bunch of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=648.74s)]
*  identity politics BS, then I guess [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=650.3000000000001s)]
*  I can't give him all the credit for [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=651.9s)]
*  that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=653.38s)]
*  Some of it has to go to her. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=653.88s)]
*  Let's be fair, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=655.0600000000001s)]
*  it's not all he does, but [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=655.7s)]
*  that is what got him the most [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=656.86s)]
*  attention nationally for sure, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=658.14s)]
*  right? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=659.9s)]
*  And that was intentionally done. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=660.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, he went after the so-called [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=662.22s)]
*  blind virus to increase his ability [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=664.66s)]
*  to get recognized nationally ahead [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=667.54s)]
*  of his presidential run. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=670.26s)]
*  Which went very well. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=672.2199999999999s)]
*  Did not go well at all. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=673.5s)]
*  It turns out if you go to woke or [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=675.02s)]
*  to hyper focused on woke, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=677.38s)]
*  you might lose your presidential [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=679.3399999999999s)]
*  bid. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=681.66s)]
*  That's exactly what happened here. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=682.18s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=683.9s)]
*  an angel gets his swings. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aY287Gakcc&t=685.62s)]
