The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# The AP Hurt Trump's FEE-FEES, So He Banished Them
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw)
*  If we feel that there are lies [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=0.0s)]
*  being pushed by outlets in this [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=1.7s)]
*  room, we are going to hold those [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=3.5s)]
*  lies accountable. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=5.32s)]
*  And it is a fact that the body of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  water off the coast of Louisiana [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=8.58s)]
*  is called the Gulf of America. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=10.52s)]
*  And I'm not sure why news outlets [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=12.36s)]
*  don't want to call it that, but [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=14.24s)]
*  that is what it is. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=16.06s)]
*  The Secretary of Interior has made [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=17.26s)]
*  that the official designation in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  the geographical identification name [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  server. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=23.64s)]
*  And Apple has recognized that, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=24.32s)]
*  Google has recognized that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=25.96s)]
*  Pretty much every other outlet in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=27.52s)]
*  the world has recognized that body [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  of water as the Gulf of America. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=30.88s)]
*  And it's very important to this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  administration that we get that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=33.96s)]
*  right, not just for people here at [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  home, but also for [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=37.32s)]
*  the rest of the world. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=38.2s)]
*  Well, the Associated Press isn't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=39.44s)]
*  buying it, and they're now being [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=41.68s)]
*  retaliated against by the Trump [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=43.8s)]
*  administration. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Trump is not allowing the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=47.16s)]
*  Associated Press to appear or [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=49.16s)]
*  attend various White House [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  briefings and White House events [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=53.64s)]
*  because of their unwillingness to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=56.12s)]
*  rename the Gulf of Mexico as [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=58.88s)]
*  the Gulf of America, which Donald [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=60.96s)]
*  Trump signed an executive order [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  renaming. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=65.68s)]
*  But the thing is, Trump doesn't [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=66.56s)]
*  really have the power to rename [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=68.64s)]
*  the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  America. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  And the Associated Press made that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=73.72s)]
*  clear in their reporting. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  They write that President Donald [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=77.72s)]
*  Trump has signed an executive order [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=79.4s)]
*  to rename the Gulf of Mexico to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=81.16s)]
*  the Gulf of America. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=82.68s)]
*  Trump's order only carries [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=83.92s)]
*  authority within the United States, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=85.36s)]
*  Mexico, as well as other countries [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  and international bodies do not [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  have to recognize the name change. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=91.12s)]
*  The Gulf of Mexico has carried that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=93.12s)]
*  name for more than 400 years. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=95.28s)]
*  The Associated Press will refer to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=97.2s)]
*  it by its original name while [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=99.56s)]
*  acknowledging the new name Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  has chosen as a global news agency [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=104.0s)]
*  that disseminates news around [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=108.56s)]
*  The Associated Press must ensure [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  that place names and geography are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  easily recognizable to all [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  audiences. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=116.84s)]
*  And guys, I want to be clear about [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=118.08s)]
*  one other thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=119.56s)]
*  The Associated Press is a little [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=120.24s)]
*  different from, let's say, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=122.0s)]
*  the New York Times or [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=123.52s)]
*  Washington Post in that it is [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  a wire service. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  So a lot of newsrooms across [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=128.16s)]
*  the country and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=129.92s)]
*  around the world rely on the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=131.0s)]
*  reporting, the original reporting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=132.96s)]
*  from the Associated Press in order [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=135.12s)]
*  to carry out their own reporting. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=137.16s)]
*  But they did note that they will go [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=139.24s)]
*  along with Donald Trump's decision [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=142.0s)]
*  to rename Alaska's Mount Denali [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=145.56s)]
*  back to what it was originally [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=148.08s)]
*  named, which was Mount McKinley. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=150.72s)]
*  The Associated Press will use [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=154.12s)]
*  the original name change to Mount [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=156.04s)]
*  McKinley. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=158.32s)]
*  The area lies solely in the United [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=159.76s)]
*  States, and as President, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump has the authority to change [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=163.72s)]
*  federal geographical names within [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=165.84s)]
*  the country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=168.08s)]
*  Now, there is a lot of backlash in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=169.68s)]
*  regard to what the Trump [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=171.6s)]
*  administration is doing by [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=172.96s)]
*  barring the Associated Press from [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=174.72s)]
*  attending White House briefings and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=176.72s)]
*  things like that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=179.0s)]
*  Brit Hume, who's a conservative, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=180.12s)]
*  has even called that out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=182.0s)]
*  I'm curious what you think, Cenk. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=183.56s)]
*  Yeah, my favorite part of that was [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=185.24s)]
*  when Levitt was like, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=186.88s)]
*  it's a fact that it's [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Gulf of America. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=188.96s)]
*  It's been a fact in your mind for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  about a couple of weeks, right? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Look, I get what Trump's doing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  He's doing like jingoism. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=195.24s)]
*  It's good politics. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  As a strategy, I get it, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  We do too, Gulf of America now, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=199.56s)]
*  and people love it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=201.0s)]
*  They get riled up and stuff. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  So, leader of Mexico, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=203.32s)]
*  Scheinbaum, I love her. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=204.72s)]
*  She's like, if you want to name 12 [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=206.44s)]
*  miles off the coast, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=208.6s)]
*  Gulf of America, have at it, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=209.88s)]
*  Hoss, because that's what every [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  country gets to control, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=213.44s)]
*  is 12 miles off their coast, okay? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  But the rest of the world has been [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=217.32s)]
*  calling it Gulf of Mexico for [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  400 years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=220.84s)]
*  So, Associated Press is 100%, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=224.32s)]
*  And they're right about calling it [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=224.84s)]
*  Mount McKinley, because the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  president does have the authority [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=228.64s)]
*  to do that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=230.64s)]
*  He doesn't have the authority to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  call it Gulf of Mexico. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=233.08s)]
*  So, I agree with the Associated [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=234.32s)]
*  Press, but that's not the important [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=235.76s)]
*  part here, guys. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=237.64s)]
*  The important part is the president [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=238.6s)]
*  saying that a press organization [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=240.72s)]
*  should be banned from certain [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=242.64s)]
*  events, because they're not going [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=244.24s)]
*  along with this propaganda. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=246.2s)]
*  What if he named it the Gulf of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=247.68s)]
*  Trump, and they didn't go along [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=249.52s)]
*  with that, would they then be, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=251.52s)]
*  is it okay to ban them? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=253.44s)]
*  No, it's a core First Amendment [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=254.84s)]
*  violation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=256.92s)]
*  So- Don't give him any ideas, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=258.6s)]
*  Cenk, don't give him any ideas. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=259.88s)]
*  But I will say, if I ever get [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=261.12s)]
*  an elected president, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=262.6s)]
*  I might rename Turkey, and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=263.88s)]
*  you know what I would rename it to. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=265.24s)]
*  The best? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=266.8s)]
*  No, Armenia. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=269.04s)]
*  That'll get you in trouble. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  All right, I'm going to give [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrSkAvZSXCw&t=274.28000000000003s)]
