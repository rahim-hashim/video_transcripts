The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Apparently, Republicans Didn't Realize Trump Would Freeze THEIR Federal Funds
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4)
*  For 200 years under our system of government, it was undisputed that the president had the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=0.0s)]
*  constitutional power to stop unnecessary spending through what is known as impoundment. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=6.16s)]
*  This policy is anti-inflation, anti-swamp, anti-globalist, and it's pro-growth, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=12.72s)]
*  pro-taxpayer, pro-American, and pro-freedom. I alone can get that done. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=18.96s)]
*  Now, I'm pretty sure people who supported Donald Trump didn't expect him to drain the cops on the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=24.32s)]
*  beat as it pertains to Wall Street financiers and big banks, which is exactly what happened with the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=34.72s)]
*  dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But nonetheless, Trump has been able to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=40.32s)]
*  do this without so much as a peep from Republicans in Congress. Republicans who are supposed to be a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=45.04s)]
*  part of a system of checks and balances, a check on the executive branch, if you will. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=50.88s)]
*  But now that they've made their bed, they don't wanna lay in it because with Trump cutting spending, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=56.72s)]
*  freezing federal grants and funds, Republicans are really struggling in their states and their [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=61.84s)]
*  districts. So the Washington Post is reporting that senators have in recent days made the case [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=69.76s)]
*  to cabinet secretaries and other Trump officials to let money flow back into their states. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=75.6s)]
*  Please, please, please let our states have the money that we allocated, please. Now, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=82.96s)]
*  let's stop and laugh with them. John, take it away. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=90.24s)]
*  John, yeah, so I mean, it's frustrating. I guess it's really just an evolution of what we've always [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  seen, which is like when Biden will do like a spending bill and Lauren Vought will be like, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  that's terrible tyranny, tyranny. Give me the money, give me the money, give me the money, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=102.88s)]
*  give me the money. Vote against it, vote against it, then give me the money, give me the money, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  give me the money. And so it's the same thing. And if you're a conservative, you're watching this, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=109.36s)]
*  the lesson from both of those is government spending can be awesome for your area, for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=114.32s)]
*  your district, for your state. They just don't want other people to have it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  And maybe you agree with them on that. Maybe you think it's awesome that you get stuff, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  but other people don't. I personally am one of the now scarce number of Americans who believe [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  that we should have principles that apply across the board. There are some people who believe it's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=132.56s)]
*  just me, me, me, me, me, and that's what we're seeing here. And I'm glad that there are at least [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  some journalists still around to actually reveal it. So one of the consequences of what has happened [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=141.68s)]
*  as a result of Trump freezing federal funds is some of the healthcare clinics in rural parts of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=149.2s)]
*  West Virginia have shuttered because they don't have the funding to operate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=156.08s)]
*  And while I am certain the people who are impacted by this are in fact, Republican voters, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=161.84s)]
*  Trump supporters, I find this disgusting because these people need access to healthcare. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=168.0s)]
*  And right now they don't have access to that. So you're right, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=174.96s)]
*  sometimes federal spending is awesome. Sometimes it literally saves people's lives. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, let's get to more of what is being reported here. So the Republicans are trying to finagle [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=184.48s)]
*  expectations to President Donald Trump's sweeping executive orders or cuts made by billionaire Elon [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Musk's US Doge service that frees hundreds of billions of dollars, including money for farmers [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  and infrastructure projects. But we don't need infrastructure projects. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, everything in America is all hunky dory. Our bridges are fine. Our roads are totally [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=209.2s)]
*  okay. We don't need to work on infrastructure at all, even though during Trump's first term, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=213.76s)]
*  infrastructure week was literally every week, okay? But let's continue. So we're gonna come back to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=219.04s)]
*  the sad Republicans pleading with Trump in just a moment. But first, we do need a better understanding [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=225.84s)]
*  of what Trump is actually doing, right? There's a lot of reporting out there. A lot of it is vague. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=231.04s)]
*  We're gonna get more specific, a little more granular. So he's aggressively using what is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=235.92s)]
*  referred to as the impoundment authority or the president's right to stop certain spending [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=240.8s)]
*  programs. So during the Watergate era, Richard Nixon, for instance, didn't want to spend money [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  that Congress had already appropriated. So he impounded the money. There is precedent for this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  in the past. Now, here's what former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich explains happen next. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=258.16s)]
*  Congress the next year, in 1974, passed what's called the Impoundment Control Act, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=264.64000000000004s)]
*  which said, no, a president cannot simply impound, decide what he's gonna spend money on. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  No, this is Congress's prerogative. And then the Supreme Court in 1975, the next year, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=280.32s)]
*  there was a test case. And the Supreme Court unanimously said, yes, the Impoundment Control [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=286.8s)]
*  Act is constitutional and a president cannot make up his mind about what is going to be spent [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=292.48s)]
*  and how it's gonna be spent. Now, considering Donald Trump's diet, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  it is a little bit surprising how easily he's able to impound the country. But nonetheless, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=306.16s)]
*  he did promise during the campaign that he was going to do everything he could to seize spending [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  power from Congress or seize, I should say, take a look. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=318.32s)]
*  When I return to the White House, I will do everything I can to challenge the Impoundment [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=321.04s)]
*  Control Act in court. And if necessary, get Congress to overturn it. We will overturn it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=327.04s)]
*  I will then use the president's long recognized impoundment power to squeeze the bloated federal [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=333.12s)]
*  bureaucracy for massive savings. This will be in the form of tax reductions for you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=339.28s)]
*  This will help quickly to stop inflation and slash the deficit. To prepare for this eventuality, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  on day one, I will order every federal agency to begin identifying large chunks of their budgets [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=353.2s)]
*  that can be saved through efficiencies and waste reduction using impoundment. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=360.0s)]
*  Of course, this will not include national defense. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  And look, as promised, go ahead. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=368.8s)]
*  Just to be clear, this will not include military contractors. You guys are fine. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=374.0s)]
*  Don't stop me from getting elected, please. Yeah, so by the way, Trump was touting the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  House budget bill today, encouraging its passage. It includes $100 billion in additional defense [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  spending. So you are right to point that out. But let's get back to the topic at hand. So look, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=390.16s)]
*  as promised, Donald Trump has gone on a frenzy, an executive order signing spree. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=396.32s)]
*  And he did, in fact, freeze federal funding as part of his executive order. So a laundry list [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=402.8s)]
*  of constitutional law experts and judges, including conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=410.32s)]
*  has rejected the notion that the president has a constitutional power to essentially ignore Congress [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=417.44s)]
*  and the money that it's allocated, ignore spending laws. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=424.08s)]
*  But Republican lawmakers fell in line anyway, because what would congressional lawmakers be [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  if they weren't pathetic little pricks? And I'm talking about members of both sides of the aisle, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  to be honest with you, but nonetheless. Now, they're kind of regretting their decision a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=439.2s)]
*  little bit here because they have to live with the consequences of allowing the president to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=445.44s)]
*  seize their power and the money that they themselves allocated as part of previous [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=449.68s)]
*  spending bills, right? So a slew of congressional Republicans are now begging Trump and his cabinet [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=455.04s)]
*  members to allow money that they had already appropriated to flow into their states. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=460.16s)]
*  Senator Tommy Tuberville, a close Trump ally and arguably the dumbest man on Capitol Hill, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=466.4s)]
*  suggested last week that pleading with the president for funds could be the new normal [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=472.8s)]
*  as if that's okay. He says, if we have to lobby for, hey, wait a minute, what about the bridge [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=478.88s)]
*  in Birmingham or there's a bridge in Mobile or whatever, I think that could be very possible. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=486.08s)]
*  Congratulations, and it's not just possible, it's already happening. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=494.23999999999995s)]
*  Senator Lisa Murkowski said she's been lobbying pretty much all the departments [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  restore frozen funding that's affecting her state, including the Environmental Protection Agency, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=502.88s)]
*  Interior Department, and Agriculture Department. She has also asked the Trump administration to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=509.36s)]
*  exempt Native American tribes from freezes affected by an executive action targeting [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=514.8s)]
*  programs that promote diversity. There's more than you have another Republican, Senator Katie Britt. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=521.6s)]
*  She says that she talked to Health and Human Services Secretary [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=528.72s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the administration's drastic cuts to funding provided by the National [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=534.08s)]
*  Institutes of Health to universities for indirect costs related to scientific research. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=539.2s)]
*  Look, I'm annoyed by these people because they have done this, right? They've, I mean, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  honestly, you've facilitated this, Katie Britt. But at least she understands the importance of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  the indirect costs related to scientific research. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  Because honestly, if you had asked me whether or not she does, I would probably say no based [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  on what her public statements are. But just understand, this is what she's saying behind [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=567.6s)]
*  closed doors. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, said she's been [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=571.12s)]
*  aggressively working with the EPA and its secretary, Lee Zeldin, to unfreeze grants [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  for green school buses that are manufactured in her state. Capito said she has been bombarded [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=582.64s)]
*  by questions about the freezes, but has faith overall that good programs will eventually be [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=589.84s)]
*  unfrozen. We're still not done yet. We're about to get to Senator Jerry Moran. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=595.68s)]
*  It's pronounced Moran, not moron. But John, before we get to him, your thoughts. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=601.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, this system of government is, I guess, the most predictable one that could have ended up [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=606.8s)]
*  being considering where Donald Trump comes from and what sort of business he was involved in back [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=611.12s)]
*  in the 70s, 80s and 90s. I've seen Godfather. I know how this works. I have no interest in it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=614.88s)]
*  I don't think we have any interest in any of this. That's why the Constitution is not set up this [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=619.52s)]
*  way. That's why we elect Congress people to pass laws that fund programs. And it is not up to the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=623.36s)]
*  president to decide, no, no, no, no, all your representatives, you're not representative anymore. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  All the hundreds of millions of people that voted for you, screw off, you don't count anymore. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=633.84s)]
*  The simple response to this is, could Joe Biden have done this? No, obviously the Republicans [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  don't believe that. Ten years from now, can President Ocasio-Cortez do this? No, obviously, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  she couldn't do this, so he can't do this. That's the simple version. The more complex version [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  is the last time that a king tried to rule Americans, we kicked his ass and we did it so [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=652.96s)]
*  bad that for two and a half centuries, none ever tried again. And he's trying to set himself up as [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=657.6s)]
*  a king. And it's particularly pathetic that he's doing that now when he could just go to the Senate [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=662.32s)]
*  in the House. He could have him pass a bill to do all of this stuff. He doesn't even have the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=668.08s)]
*  confidence himself, the sheer testicular fortitude to go get his pathetic toties in Congress to do [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  his bidding. He thinks he'll lose that. That's why he's not even trying. Can you imagine how [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=679.84s)]
*  much he'd wilt if there was an actual opposition in Congress right now? People did not vote for [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=684.24s)]
*  this. They were desperate. They wanted some help with inflation. I think they're already realizing [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=689.52s)]
*  that they're gonna get the exact opposite of that, but they're not interested in this at all. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=692.96s)]
*  They didn't want a king. They didn't want an authoritarian government. They didn't want to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=696.72s)]
*  nullify Congress. We don't want a House of Lords. We want a House of Representatives. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=701.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again, having a system of checks and balances is incredibly important. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=705.04s)]
*  I'm disgusted with Congress for ceding their power to the executive branch over the last few decades. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=710.8s)]
*  And it kind of went on overdrive after the 9-11 attacks. And look, it's just laughable to see what [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=719.28s)]
*  Republicans are up to behind closed doors when publicly, again and again, they only enable [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=727.1999999999999s)]
*  anything and everything the Trump administration wants to do. So let's get back to Senator Jerry [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=733.04s)]
*  Moran, who actually decided to do some of this publicly. He took to X to ask Secretary of State [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  Marco Rubio to help unfreeze food aid that has been stalled in US ports after the administration [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=744.8s)]
*  decided to dismantle USAID. Here's what he wrote. He says, I urge [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=752.4s)]
*  Secretary Rubio to distribute the $340 million in American grown food currently stalled in US ports [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=758.0s)]
*  to reach those in need. Time is running out before this life-saving aid parishes. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=767.12s)]
*  Now, a day after he posted on X, he thanked Secretary of State Marco Rubio for releasing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=773.04s)]
*  $560 million in food aid. So that's how this is working out. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=780.16s)]
*  Right. And it's just so incredibly gross. So the ramifications of Trump's power grab [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=785.6s)]
*  do go far beyond these embarrassing submissive Republicans. And look, you're into that kind of [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=791.28s)]
*  thing. Keep it in your bedroom, okay? We don't need to see it. Just do your job, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  do what you were elected to do. For one, it's creating confusion and it's leaving communities [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=802.08s)]
*  without necessary funding, including communities, rural communities in West Virginia who now don't [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  have access to the healthcare clinics that were funded by the federal government. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=813.9200000000001s)]
*  Plus, it also creates perverse incentives. So Matt Glassman, who's a former Hill staffer who [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=819.12s)]
*  worked for the Congressional Research Service, says this, quote, I think it's very indicative [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=824.48s)]
*  of why the impoundment power is so dangerous. It creates a sort of favor factory atmosphere [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=830.0s)]
*  where you've got to beg the president for your funding. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=837.04s)]
*  And I agree with him on that. And look, the one other thing that I'll say is, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=839.76s)]
*  I totally get the concerns about taxpayer money getting wasted because it does get wasted on all [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=844.56s)]
*  sorts of nonsense programs. But you wanna know why that happens? Because there are literally lobbyists [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=850.8s)]
*  who lobby for that pork barrel spending. You know how you can do away with that? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=857.04s)]
*  Get rid of money in politics, get rid of the corruption that's baked into our system. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=863.68s)]
*  But we're not gonna do that, are we? Instead, we're going to victimize the [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  most powerless people in the country who rely on certain programs that are, in fact, funded by [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=875.04s)]
*  the federal government. And I think that's gross. And by the way, in terms of the negative [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=880.24s)]
*  ramifications, that is totally nonpartisan. And so it makes me so sad to see this. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=884.64s)]
*  Any final words, John? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=892.96s)]
*  Yeah, no, I 100% agree. And I'm glad that there's shows like this that on a daily basis, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=894.08s)]
*  you're revealing all of the different people and organizations and communities that are being hurt [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=899.68s)]
*  by this. And many of them, maybe in the end, most of them might end up being conservative, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=903.6s)]
*  might be MAGA. We already know that conservatives draw more money from the federal government than [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=908.96s)]
*  they give the red states. So when you cut it, you're probably going to do more than 50% of the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=913.36s)]
*  damage to the people that voted for Donald Trump. Now, I don't care about the partisan side. I think [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=918.48s)]
*  a lot of this is stupid and awful. It's incredibly dumb. I think the way he's going about it, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  refusing to go through Congress is deeply un-American. I don't think it's gonna be [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=927.76s)]
*  popular at all. And maybe most importantly, for the people who genuinely do wanna see [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=931.6800000000001s)]
*  cuts to the government or savings or whatever, I need you to understand [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=937.52s)]
*  that even if they do end up making big cuts, and so far what Doggie has announced is basically [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=942.4s)]
*  nothing, it's not going to you. It's gonna pay off 10% of the tax cuts to the richest people [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=947.84s)]
*  in the country and that's it, which is still going to jack up the deficit and the national debt. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=954.0799999999999s)]
*  These checks are not going to you. Please understand that. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=958.56s)]
*  You got emojis of me, Anna, John, JR. So those are super fun. But you also get [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgq7Yo9VSX4&t=972.56s)]
