"BEN SHAPIRO (HOST): The Trump administration is going up against the Associated Press. So the Associated Press has now sued the Trump administration because the administration said that they can't come on Air Force One. And the reason for that is because the Trump administration is mad at the AP for not renaming the Gulf Of Mexico the Gulf Of America. So they've barred AP reporters from the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other official White House events. And now the AP is filing a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia against Trump administration officials, including the White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich, the White House press secretary Caroline Leavitt, and the White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. The complaint objects to the White House ordering the wire service to use specific words in its reporting and stated it had filed suit to quote vindicate its rights to the editorial independence guaranteed by The US constitution."*

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Ben Shapiro is REAL ANGRY at the Trump Admin
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE)
*  Yesterday, Edward Martin is the US attorney for the District of Columbia. He put out a statement [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=0.0s)]
*  quote, as President Trump's lawyers, we are proud to fight to protect his leadership as our president. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=3.84s)]
*  And we are vigilant in standing against entities like the AP that refuse to put America first. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=7.68s)]
*  Sounds rather tyrannical and stupid. There is no reason to do that sort of stuff. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=11.52s)]
*  Agree, totally agree with Ben Shapiro, who called out the Trump administration for a move that he [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=15.52s)]
*  believes went too far and did call tyrannical and stupid. So what exactly did the Trump [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=24.88s)]
*  administration do? Well, as we have covered previously on this show, the Trump administration [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  is feuding with the Associated Press over the dumbest thing imaginable. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=37.12s)]
*  Remember, the Associated Press isn't just a news agency here in the United States. It is a wire [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=42.72s)]
*  service, meaning they provide coverage of events worldwide, okay? It's a wire service [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=49.92s)]
*  internationally speaking. So when it comes to something like renaming the Gulf of Mexico, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=58.32s)]
*  the Gulf of America, well, Trump doesn't have the ability to just unilaterally change the name. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=63.84s)]
*  And so the Associated Press, being an international news wire service, is gonna stick to the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=71.36s)]
*  internationally recognized name, which is the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=78.32s)]
*  Trump doesn't like that. He's whining about it. And in response, the Trump administration has banned [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=82.32s)]
*  the Associated Press from the White House, the Oval Office, and Air Force One, essentially [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=88.08s)]
*  punishing them for doing their jobs accurately as an international news wire service. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=94.16s)]
*  The AP, by the way, is now suing the Trump administration, including [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=101.52s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt. Now let's watch Ben Shapiro as he admits that the Trump [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=104.96s)]
*  administration might not come out on top in this legal battle. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=110.55999999999999s)]
*  The reality is that if the White House said the reason that you're ousted is because you won't [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=114.96s)]
*  say the things we want you to say, probably the White House loses in court on that because that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  would presumably be a First Amendment violation. What they actually should just say is, listen, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=126.16s)]
*  we're not even gonna give you a reason, right? The White House under Joe Biden didn't include [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=131.04s)]
*  any of the alternative media at all. And we're gonna treat all media equally, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=136.56s)]
*  which means the AP does not get a leg up on, say, the Daily Wire or Breitbart or Daily Caller or [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  anybody else in the online media. However, if you want to lose the sort of momentum that Trump has, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=145.6s)]
*  and this is again, I'm concerned with this because I want to see President Trump victorious. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  Distractions are the enemy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=156.72s)]
*  Yeah, but this isn't just a distraction, Ben, and he knows that. He knows. I mean, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=157.92s)]
*  Trump can't stand any media that doesn't go along with whatever narrative he's trying to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  push out there. And if AP is unwilling to play ball with his unilateral renaming of the Gulf [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=170.64s)]
*  of Mexico, he does want to be a tyrant and essentially punish them for that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  And that's wrong. We're supposed to have freedom of speech. And by the way, I also agree that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=182.32s)]
*  the White House is not obligated to give everyone access to White House press briefings, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=186.48s)]
*  the Oval Office and all of that. I agree with that. However, don't downplay this as [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  something less concerning than what it really is. This is tyrannical and this is wrong. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=198.16s)]
*  Punishing the Associated Press and going after them viciously because they're not [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=204.0s)]
*  playing ball with Trump is wrong. Yeah, with your bizarre propaganda. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. That Trump is obviously using to distract [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  people from other things that he's doing. Nobody thinks he actually deeply wants it to be called [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=215.44s)]
*  the Gulf of America. It is deeply disrespectful to his voters. It's disrespectful to people that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=220.48s)]
*  will think this is stupid, but it's more disrespectful to the people who will think it's a good idea. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=226.24s)]
*  Because he's playing them. You do not do stuff like this to people you actually care about and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=232.4s)]
*  respect. And Ben, of course, is not acknowledging that. I agree with most of what you said. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=237.52s)]
*  I think that I'm glad that he is calling it out for being looking tyrannical and covering it all. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=241.04s)]
*  He doesn't have to cover it all. I think he loses credit when he frames the entire thing as [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  this is only bad because it could be distracting. I agree with you. That is not the only reason [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=251.76s)]
*  that it's bad. And it's super weird that the only thing that bothers you is that this looks [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=257.36s)]
*  tyrannical, not that he's doing tyrannical things. That he is not respecting the Constitution, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=261.68s)]
*  the separation of powers. He's defying what the judges have already ruled. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=267.2s)]
*  These are not things that look tyrannical. These things are tyrannical, and that's the issue. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=271.2s)]
*  And then pretending that the AP and Breitbart are the same thing, that's ridiculous. Look, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=275.84s)]
*  I would love for Joe Biden to have let TYT in or whatever. But I also don't think that's the exact [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  same thing as having, again, an internationally very necessary wire service that provides news [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=286.0s)]
*  that's picked up and used by literally thousands of our new services. It's obviously not the same [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=290.8s)]
*  thing. Stop playing games like that. Yes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=295.52s)]
*  And so- Well, maybe, maybe, maybe Ben Shapiro can redeem himself because it's not all he said. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=297.44s)]
*  So the Trump administration then tripled down, which led to Shapiro stating that they would [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=305.44s)]
*  absolutely lose a court battle. On Monday, Ed Martin, the interim US attorney for Washington, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=312.88s)]
*  DC, posted the statement that we played in our video at the start of this segment. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=318.96s)]
*  So here it is again, it reads, as President Trump's lawyers, we are proud to fight to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=325.04s)]
*  protect his leadership as our president. And we are vigilant in standing against entities [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=330.32s)]
*  like the Associated Press that refuse to put America first. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so that is not what his role in the federal government is supposed to be, essentially [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  providing cover for Trump, protecting Trump. That's not what their role is supposed to be, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=349.04s)]
*  number one. But even more concerning is this announcement that they're going along with Trump [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=353.6s)]
*  in wanting to essentially punish the Associated Press. And that, by the way, got hit with the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=359.6s)]
*  following community note. The duties of each US attorney's office, as defined by 28 US Code 547R, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=365.6s)]
*  prosecute federal crimes, present the United States in civil actions, and collect debts owed [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  to the federal government, which are administratively uncollectible. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=382.64s)]
*  Here's Ben Shapiro explaining how that statement could actually [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=387.28s)]
*  sink the Trump administration's case in court. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  That is just conceding the actual legal case. Because if the case that you are making is that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=393.52s)]
*  the media have to reflect the perspective of the President of the United States to be given access, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=399.36s)]
*  you're gonna lose in court. Also, it sounds rather tyrannical and stupid. There is no reason [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=403.12s)]
*  to do that sort of stuff. But they're gonna do it anyway. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  Because there are no brakes on this car. And so any of our norms, any of our separations of powers, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=413.28s)]
*  all of that stuff has been thrown out the window under this new Trump administration. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=422.08s)]
*  And by the way, we wouldn't put money on Trump or anyone on his team listening to Shapiro. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=426.64s)]
*  In fact, today Trump stated that media outlets that use anonymous sources should be sued. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=432.08s)]
*  So how's that for press freedom? He says as a president who is being given credit for having [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=440.23999999999995s)]
*  the best opening month of any president, and okay, all right. Anyway, I'm not gonna read all that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=445.76s)]
*  You get the point. He doesn't like that sometimes anonymous sources provide statements to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=451.52s)]
*  journalists anonymously because they're fearful of retaliation from their bosses or from government [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=458.4s)]
*  agencies, from Donald Trump specifically. So he's now going to go after [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=465.92s)]
*  reporters who use anonymous sources. Okay, yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  Can we bring up that tweet for one sec? Cuz I think there's an interesting thing [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  in there where he's like you can't use anonymous sources. But he does start off by saying as a [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=479.68s)]
*  president who's being given credit for having the best opening month of any president in history, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  sorry buddy, you didn't cite your sources. Who said that? I'm gonna sue you unless you divulge [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  who said you had the best month ever. And then he also says in the middle of that, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=492.96s)]
*  I'm going to at some point I'm gonna sue some of these dishonest authors and book publishers [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=497.36s)]
*  or even media in general. I'm just gonna sue media in general for doing this sort of thing. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=502.32s)]
*  And again, Ben Shapiro doesn't get to be surprised by this. Donald Trump has been [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=509.6s)]
*  utterly hostile to the press this entire time. He has no respect for the First Amendment. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=512.32s)]
*  This is not new. Yeah, I totally agree with you. Look, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=516.16s)]
*  Trump has hated the media consistently. He has tried to punish the media consistently. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=519.12s)]
*  He has succeeded in getting some of the billionaire media owners like Jeff Bezos to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=525.68s)]
*  heal before him like a little bitch. But any thought that we're talking about a guy who [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=533.52s)]
*  actually values constitutional protections like freedom of speech and freedom of press, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=540.72s)]
*  he doesn't. He's made that clear. And now he's got a cabinet full of all sorts of individuals [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6qNLX3sNE&t=544.64s)]
