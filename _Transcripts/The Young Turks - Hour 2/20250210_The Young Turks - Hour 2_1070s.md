"Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries quietly met with more than 150 Silicon Valley-based donors last week in California ‚Äî an early step in Democrats‚Äô efforts to repair relationships with a once-deep blue constituency.

The meet-and-greet, in tony Los Altos Hills, came at a precarious moment for Democrats in the tech world, which has lurched rightward in the second Donald Trump era. The world‚Äôs wealthiest tech mogul is upending Washington, and Democratic leaders are facing criticism from their own base for their halting response. Jeffries, meanwhile, was on the West Coast seemingly trying to avoid the next Elon Musk."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

*  But isn't it amazing that when [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=201.24s)]
*  Republicans want something, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=202.74s)]
*  they usually find a way to get [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=204.34s)]
*  what they want? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=205.68s)]
*  Anyway, he doubled down later in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=207.16s)]
*  the same press conference. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's hear what the House Minority [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  Leader has to say. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=211.6s)]
*  We've made clear from the beginning [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=213.04s)]
*  is a season to govern and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=215.12s)]
*  a season to campaign. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=216.92s)]
*  We are in the governing season. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=218.96s)]
*  And so we're ready to work [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=222.84s)]
*  together on any issue. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=225.24s)]
*  But I'm also confused about the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=227.72s)]
*  leverage that we allegedly have in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=230.3s)]

*  mandate that was given to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=235.1s)]
*  Republicans by the American people [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=236.98s)]
*  according to them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=239.62s)]
*  Listen, no one is stupid enough to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=241.5s)]
*  think that Democrats have a modicum [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=243.76s)]
*  of power right now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=246.06s)]
*  They don't, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=247.38s)]
*  they have no power right now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=247.98s)]
*  We all understand that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=249.46s)]
*  But how about take a look at [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=250.62s)]
*  the behavior of Republicans when [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=252.42s)]
*  they were in power? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  Behavior of Republicans when they [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  are not in power, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=257.72s)]
*  you want to know what they do? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=258.6s)]
*  They don't shut up, okay? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  They're doing press conferences, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  they're doing congressional [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=264.64s)]
*  hearings, they're repetitive. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=266.04s)]
*  Again, and again, I mean, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=268.0s)]
*  the Hillary Benghazi thing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=269.32s)]
*  Every single day, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=270.8s)]
*  Hillary Benghazi, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=271.72s)]
*  Hillary Benghazi, Hillary Benghazi. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=272.68s)]
*  Democrats though, they cower, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=275.2s)]
*  they cower and then they tell their [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  own supporters, shut up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=279.32s)]
*  There's nothing we can do because [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=281.8s)]
*  we don't have enough power. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=283.12s)]
*  And then what they'll say is, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=284.38s)]
*  we need to have control of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=285.82s)]
*  Congress. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  And then everyone will get out [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=287.94s)]
*  the vote, they'll organize, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=289.42s)]
*  they'll canvass, they'll fight real [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=291.06s)]
*  hard to ensure Democrats have [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=292.94s)]
*  the majority in Congress and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=294.36s)]
*  both the lower chamber, Senate. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  And guess what they do with [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  that power, nothing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=299.06s)]
*  That's what Biden had. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=300.38s)]
*  And then it was excuse after [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=301.42s)]
*  excuse after excuse for [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  why they can't get their own [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=303.5s)]
*  agenda accomplished. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=304.82s)]
*  Even when they had controlled [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=306.3s)]
*  the executive branch and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=307.7s)]
*  they had control of Congress. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=308.90000000000003s)]
*  But don't worry, don't fret, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=310.74s)]
*  because there's another Democratic [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=312.22s)]
*  leader who's going to fight for us. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=314.12s)]
*  And she's going to explain how in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  this next clip. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  My whole passion about being in [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  politics is for the children. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=319.64s)]
*  So what is it that we're doing for [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  the children? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  I think that it would have been [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  important for the children to not [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=326.44s)]
*  have Donald Trump be president of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=328.44s)]
*  the United States. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=330.4s)]
*  And that is, I would take every [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=332.08s)]
*  step necessary to make sure that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  didn't happen, but it did. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=336.0s)]
*  And now we have to deal with it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  And in about six or seven months, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  you're going to see such a change [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=342.41999999999996s)]
*  by the time we start our campaigns [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  in this fall for next fall. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  You're going to see a very [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=349.14s)]
*  different picture about the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=351.18s)]
*  Democrats vis-a-vis Donald Trump. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=353.5s)]
*  Retire. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=356.5s)]
*  She's sitting there and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=357.5s)]
*  talking about like, don't worry. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=358.78s)]
*  In six months, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=360.9s)]
*  we might start fighting back. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=361.9s)]
*  And yeah, and I want to explain why [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=364.29999999999995s)]
*  she says six to seven months. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=366.29999999999995s)]
*  First, let me go through all this [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=368.29999999999995s)]
*  and we're going to be constructive. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=369.62s)]
*  I'm going to tell you what they [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=370.68s)]
*  actually should do, okay? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=372.12s)]
*  Because I think we're the only [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  show that ever does that, right? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=374.86s)]
*  So first of all, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  on Hakeem Jeffries, he says, well, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  there's nothing we do in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=379.6s)]
*  the minority. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=380.76000000000005s)]
*  But wait a minute, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=381.88000000000005s)]
*  when you were in the majority and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  Biden had the House, the Senate, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=383.76000000000005s)]
*  and the White House, you also said [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=385.24s)]
*  there was nothing you could do. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=386.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=388.04s)]
*  Because the GOP was blocking all [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=389.12s)]
*  your bills even though they were [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=390.48s)]
*  in the minority because of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  the filibuster. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=392.76000000000005s)]
*  So why don't you do the same thing [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=394.12s)]
*  and then there would be something [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  you could do? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=397.16s)]
*  Why don't you just do exactly what [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=398.44000000000005s)]
*  the Republicans did to you that you [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=399.97999999999996s)]
*  complained about when Biden was [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=401.62s)]

*  Because when you were in charge, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  you couldn't stop talking about [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=407.97999999999996s)]
*  the filibuster and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  the parliamentarian. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=409.73999999999995s)]

*  the parliamentarian. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=412.38s)]

*  I mean, at a bare minimum, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=415.14s)]
*  can't you do that? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=416.53999999999996s)]
*  For him to pretend that he has no [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=418.34s)]

*  And what is the most important [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=440.36s)]
*  thing for the children, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=441.4s)]
*  according to her? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=442.24s)]
*  That Donald Trump not win. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=443.44s)]
*  In other words, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=444.68s)]
*  that the Democrats win. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=445.2s)]
*  Yeah, I was talking to a kid the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=446.6s)]
*  other day, he's like, man, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=447.8s)]
*  if more Democrats won, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=448.88s)]
*  I'd be so happy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=449.84s)]
*  Okay, I mean, this is just such [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=451.2s)]
*  infantile way of trying to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=453.4s)]
*  manipulate people. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=455.32s)]
*  If you care about your kids, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=457.46s)]
*  you vote Democrat. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=458.58s)]
*  So why does six to seven months [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=460.02s)]
*  from now? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=461.21999999999997s)]
*  Because as she said, that's when [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=461.86s)]
*  our campaign is going to start. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  They're not going to fight back [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=465.14s)]
*  when you're in trouble. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=466.34s)]
*  They're not fighting back right [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=467.74s)]
*  now when the Trump team is saying [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=469.1s)]
*  we're not listening to the courts. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=470.54s)]
*  That's the giant, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=472.74s)]
*  unbelievable constitutional crisis, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=473.62s)]
*  right? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=475.5s)]
*  No, they're going to wait until [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=476.38s)]
*  their self-interest is affected. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=478.22s)]
*  Six to seven months from now, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=480.02s)]
*  when their campaigns start. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=482.22s)]
*  And look at the speed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=485.02s)]
*  Biden gets in, Trump, boom, boom, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  boom, boom, boom, boom, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=489.52s)]
*  doing a thousand actions. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=491.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon is laughing his ass [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=492.52s)]
*  off today talking about, yeah, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=494.12s)]
*  we flooded the zone. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=495.64s)]
*  And we're stunned at how little the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  Democrats did in return. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  It looks like they had three months [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  to prepare and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=501.08s)]
*  didn't prepare a single thing. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=501.64s)]
*  He's rubbing our face in it, and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=502.76s)]
*  he's right about it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=504.44s)]
*  He's right, he's totally right. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  And so, I mean, God, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  they're so pathetic, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=508.79999999999995s)]
*  they can't plan anything. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  No, they have something up their [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=511.96s)]
*  sleeve, though. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=513.6s)]
*  Let's be fair, let's be fair to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=514.56s)]
*  the Democrats because they do have [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=516.26s)]
*  something up their sleeve. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=517.98s)]
*  I wrote about this over the weekend. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=519.5s)]
*  They're relying on a super PAC [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=522.0600000000001s)]
*  that's funded by the good [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=523.98s)]
*  billionaires, don't worry. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=525.54s)]
*  It's not the bad billionaires, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=527.1s)]
*  according to Democrats, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=528.9s)]
*  the good billionaires who are going [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=530.38s)]
*  to help them connect with [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=532.38s)]
*  the working class. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=533.74s)]
*  So the New York Times wrote about [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=534.9s)]
*  this as well. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=537.3s)]
*  They write that the win them back [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=538.42s)]
*  fund will begin by spending [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=541.42s)]
*  extensively on research before [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=543.92s)]
*  eventually mounting advertising [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  campaigns in key districts, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=548.52s)]
*  as well as potentially investing [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=550.6s)]
*  in influencers to spread the party's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=552.56s)]
*  message to less engaged voters. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=554.64s)]
*  So how is this different from their [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=556.56s)]
*  campaign strategy, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=558.8s)]
*  which failed miserably? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=560.24s)]
*  And why do you need to do [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=562.0s)]
*  extensive research that's funded [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=563.72s)]
*  by billionaires to understand [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=566.28s)]
*  working class voters and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=568.4399999999999s)]
*  how to appeal to them? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=570.0799999999999s)]
*  And think of, I mean, come on, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=571.48s)]
*  guys, think about how hilarious. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=572.8s)]
*  That is, we're going to ask [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=573.9s)]
*  the billionaires how much we can [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  help the middle class and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=577.3s)]
*  let come up with a genius strategy. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=578.76s)]
*  Now I know that their billionaires [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=581.22s)]
*  are funding the pollsters, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=583.14s)]
*  the consultants, etc. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=584.72s)]
*  But do you see what they're doing? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=585.9399999999999s)]
*  A, they have no actual ideology. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=587.3s)]
*  They're going to do focus groups to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=591.02s)]
*  figure out what would resonate. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=593.42s)]
*  Now to actually do those things, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=596.3s)]
*  if the focus group comes back and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=597.78s)]
*  says, yeah, do $15 minimum wage [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=599.3s)]
*  like we told you. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=600.74s)]
*  Do paid family leave like we told [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=602.02s)]
*  you a hundred times, right? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=603.54s)]
*  Are they going to actually do [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=605.28s)]
*  those things? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  No, the focus group and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=607.04s)]
*  the study funded by the billionaires [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=608.4s)]
*  is so they can tell you what [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=610.5999999999999s)]
*  they're going to pretend to do. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=612.12s)]
*  And then when they get into office, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=614.0s)]
*  they'll say there was nothing we [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=615.7199999999999s)]
*  could do, okay? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  So that's why we need a strong [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=618.48s)]
*  Democratic party so [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=620.48s)]
*  desperately right now, and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=621.9599999999999s)]
*  they're still doing the same game. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=624.12s)]
*  No, it's the same game. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=626.5999999999999s)]
*  The issue with the Democrats in [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=628.12s)]
*  this last election cycle, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=630.4s)]
*  wasn't the lack of money and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=632.98s)]
*  it wasn't the lack of advertising [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=635.1s)]
*  either. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=637.84s)]

*  Kamala Harris raised a lot more [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=648.98s)]
*  money than Donald Trump did, okay? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=650.5s)]
*  That could have paid for [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=652.78s)]

*  The top donor is Michael Bloomberg [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=685.18s)]
*  to the tune of $13 million. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=687.0600000000001s)]
*  And this is just in the last [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=688.66s)]
*  election cycle in 2023 through 2024. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=690.26s)]
*  If anyone knows how to win back [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=692.66s)]
*  the middle classes, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=694.26s)]
*  Michael freaking Bloomberg. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=695.26s)]
*  Yeah, there's more. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=697.16s)]
*  Tom Steyer donated $2 million to [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=698.84s)]
*  it, real estate developer John Fish. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=700.92s)]
*  So I looked through all the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=704.16s)]
*  documents to see he donated [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=705.76s)]
*  multiple times and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=707.52s)]
*  it all amounted to $2.27 million. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=708.68s)]
*  He's known for fighting against [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=711.3199999999999s)]
*  progressive tax policies in his [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=713.92s)]
*  state, Massachusetts, I believe. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=716.56s)]
*  So yeah, he would really know a lot [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=720.56s)]
*  about connecting with [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=722.36s)]
*  the working class. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  LinkedIn co-founder Reed Hoffman, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=724.64s)]
*  $25 million. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=726.9s)]
*  But look at all the Bain Capital [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=727.9399999999999s)]
*  executives. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=729.7s)]
*  Bain Capital, a private equity [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=730.9s)]
*  firm, really concerned about [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=732.48s)]
*  appealing to the working class. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=733.9s)]
*  Do you think that that group might [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=735.62s)]
*  come up with a policy that says, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=737.9s)]
*  hey, you know what, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=740.02s)]
*  it turns out private equity buying [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=741.26s)]
*  up all the residential homes is [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=743.32s)]
*  super unpopular. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=745.04s)]
*  If you fight back against that, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=746.42s)]
*  American people will love it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=747.9399999999999s)]
*  You're funded by Bain, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=750.58s)]
*  that's a private equity company. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=751.42s)]
*  They're not going to come up with [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=752.86s)]
*  that conclusion. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=753.9s)]
*  They're going to come up with [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=754.66s)]
*  smokes and mirrors like [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=756.0s)]
*  the Democrats always do. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=757.08s)]
*  And I'm going to end on this. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=758.44s)]
*  So one of the people who kind of [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=759.28s)]
*  participated in this meeting that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=761.76s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries had with 150 [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=764.6s)]
*  Silicon Valley based donors in [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=767.4s)]
*  California to mend fences, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=770.36s)]
*  was a gentleman I'm about to read [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=772.82s)]
*  a comment from or a message from. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=775.38s)]
*  So he says that the singular focus [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  of that meeting was how do we [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=780.0s)]
*  ensure Silicon Valley remains with [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=782.0s)]
*  Democrats because right now Silicon [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=784.5s)]
*  Valley is feeling very purple. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=786.7s)]
*  Because that's the main concern of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=788.54s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=790.62s)]
*  It's not really about appealing to [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=792.34s)]
*  working class voters. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=793.78s)]
*  It's about ensuring that they don't [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=794.66s)]
*  lose their precious precious [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=796.4200000000001s)]
*  Silicon Valley donors, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=797.86s)]
*  some of whom have already defected [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=799.22s)]
*  and support Trump. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=801.02s)]
*  Alex Hoffman, a Democratic donor [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=802.4200000000001s)]
*  advisor who works with donors [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=804.5s)]
*  across the country, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=806.3000000000001s)]
*  made this incredible statement. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=807.58s)]
*  There is a significant fear that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=810.02s)]
*  the tech folks who have been with [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=812.52s)]
*  us for a long time will say, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=815.08s)]
*  we're going with the other guys. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=817.28s)]
*  These donors are also pissed [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=820.16s)]
*  watching former and current [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=821.96s)]
*  colleagues have unlimited unchecked [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=823.7s)]
*  power and getting richer off of [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=826.16s)]
*  this and they're not. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=828.2s)]
*  Meaning the Silicon Valley [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=829.72s)]
*  executives who supported Trump, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=831.6s)]
*  they're getting everything they [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=833.84s)]
*  want. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=835.96s)]
*  And the ones who decided to stick [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=836.48s)]
*  with Democrats aren't and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=838.36s)]
*  they're very jealous. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=839.76s)]
*  Guys, that last quote was [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=841.9s)]
*  devastating. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=843.26s)]
*  Because the last part is the worst [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=844.78s)]
*  part. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=846.26s)]
*  If they had just left it at, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=846.66s)]
*  they're very frustrated because [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=847.9s)]
*  all these guys who gave to Donald [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=849.4599999999999s)]
*  Trump are getting everything they [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=850.98s)]
*  want. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=852.3399999999999s)]
*  Okay, that sounds fair. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=852.86s)]
*  But they gratuitously added, but [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=855.54s)]
*  we're not. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=857.6999999999999s)]
*  We wanted all the goodies and now [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=859.06s)]
*  it turns out backing Trump would [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=860.66s)]
*  have gotten us the goodies. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=862.2199999999999s)]
*  You guys didn't deliver enough for [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=863.86s)]
*  our bribes, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=865.3s)]
*  I mean campaign contributions. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=865.9s)]
*  And that's why we're going to give [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=867.74s)]
*  you more so that you can come up [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=869.14s)]
*  with a new strategy to trick people [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=870.56s)]
*  into supporting private equity. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=872.4s)]
*  I mean, connect with [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=874.12s)]
*  the working class. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=875.0s)]
*  Okay, so now let's be constructive [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=876.48s)]
*  because if all we do is tear down [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=879.12s)]
*  these Democrats, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=881.4s)]
*  then what hope do we have? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=882.8399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so that's why I tried to help [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=884.64s)]
*  build a different portion of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=886.4399999999999s)]
*  the Democratic Party, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=888.04s)]
*  just Democrats, etc. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=889.28s)]
*  That had its upsides, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=890.5999999999999s)]
*  it's had its downsides. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=891.64s)]
*  But at some point somebody's got [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=893.1999999999999s)]
*  to do this, okay? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=894.8s)]
*  So first off, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=896.24s)]
*  you need leadership. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=896.92s)]
*  I don't care if you're an actual [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=898.56s)]
*  leader, Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=899.64s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, etc. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=900.64s)]
*  Somebody in the Senate in the House [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=901.62s)]
*  raise their hand and go, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=903.14s)]
*  I'm having a meeting. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=904.1s)]
*  Anyone who wants to fight back, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=905.14s)]
*  this is not public, come in, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=906.5s)]
*  we're doing a meeting. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=907.6999999999999s)]
*  Okay, hey, I don't need Hakeem [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=908.78s)]
*  Jeffries' permission. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=910.5s)]
*  Jamie, you're going on MSNBC. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=911.6999999999999s)]
*  Steve Cohen, you're going on Fox [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=914.22s)]
*  News, this guy, you're going there. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=916.26s)]
*  You're going on Joe Rogan's podcast [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=918.5s)]
*  if you can get on, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=920.26s)]
*  you're going on the other podcasts, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=921.06s)]
*  etc. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=922.54s)]
*  And okay, now, we're all doing that [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=923.18s)]
*  so we get our message out. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=925.7s)]
*  That is number one thing we can do. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=927.78s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries just said earlier [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=929.64s)]
*  in that what we showed you that [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=931.72s)]
*  the Republicans won by getting [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=933.52s)]
*  their message out. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=935.32s)]
*  So knucklehead, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=936.36s)]
*  you might want to do the same. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=937.64s)]
*  God, these keys nowhere near a [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=940.16s)]
*  leader. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=942.16s)]
*  Okay, then secondly, you have to [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=943.32s)]
*  agree on what the messaging is. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=944.52s)]
*  What is a powerful message that you [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=945.96s)]
*  could deliver? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=947.6s)]
*  So for example, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=948.2s)]
*  we covered a story and it might [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=949.24s)]
*  seem like a minor story to some, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=951.16s)]
*  but it's actually excellent moral [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=953.24s)]
*  high ground to fight from last week, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=955.4s)]
*  which was, they're getting rid of [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=957.66s)]
*  the lead cleaning in the water. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=959.9s)]
*  That means there's going to be more [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=962.58s)]
*  lead poisoning, that means it [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=964.26s)]
*  literally drops IQ points of kids. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=965.8199999999999s)]
*  It increases crime and cleaning up [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=968.22s)]
*  the lead out of the water has an [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=970.66s)]
*  over 90% approval rating. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=972.54s)]
*  So if you all went out on [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=975.42s)]
*  the Sunday shows, you all went on [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=976.54s)]
*  the podcast, you all went on online [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=977.98s)]
*  media and you said at the same time, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=979.62s)]
*  they're poisoning our kids. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=981.26s)]
*  And here's definitive proof, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=982.9399999999999s)]
*  why are they doing this? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=984.5s)]
*  Then you're fighting on moral high [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=985.8s)]
*  ground and you're doing damage. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=987.52s)]
*  Republicans do this all the time [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=989.3199999999999s)]
*  with tiny little issues that [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=990.8s)]
*  nobody's even ever freaking heard [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=992.12s)]
*  of, right? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=993.68s)]
*  This lead thing is an actual real [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=994.8399999999999s)]
*  important thing. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=996.12s)]
*  And by the way, he's like, well, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=996.64s)]
*  we're trying to work with them. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=998.28s)]
*  Look, if you say, hey, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1000.3199999999999s)]
*  there's some things I would like to [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1001.52s)]
*  work with them on, good, no problem. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1003.36s)]
*  I say, for example, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1005.64s)]
*  you want to cut the Pentagon? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1006.68s)]
*  That's a Democratic priority. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1008.24s)]
*  If the Republicans agree, it was. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1009.8399999999999s)]
*  If the Republicans agree, great, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1011.8s)]
*  then by the way, what do you do? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1013.64s)]
*  You look reasonable for [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1015.54s)]
*  working with them on an issue [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1016.98s)]
*  that's popular and [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1018.78s)]
*  was yours to begin with, right? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1020.02s)]
*  So there's ways to agree on a small [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1023.14s)]
*  number of things and fight back on [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1025.3s)]
*  the other parts and do it right. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1027.3799999999999s)]
*  But are they going to figure out [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1029.74s)]
*  any of that? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1031.34s)]
*  No, and that's why it's hard not to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1031.98s)]
*  be despondent. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1034.62s)]
*  The Democratic Party is so [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1036.34s)]
*  pathetic. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1038.1s)]
*  There isn't one freaking leader [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1039.26s)]
*  that could do any of this [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1041.18s)]
*  messaging. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMBhL7x-fPE&t=1042.3799999999999s)]
