The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump Admin Panics After "Accidentally" Firing Scientists Working on Bird Flu
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU)
*  President Biden didn't really have a plan for avian flu. Well, Brooke Rollins and I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=0.0s)]
*  have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=3.72s)]
*  the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=7.18s)]
*  what we're gonna do with avian flu. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Having a smart perimeter is what we're working on and we're finalizing the ideas about how [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=12.5s)]
*  to do that with the best scientists in government. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=16.12s)]
*  Well, the Trump administration accidentally fired some of those best scientists. NBC News [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=19.92s)]
*  has reported that the USDA admitted that it had accidentally fired several agency employees [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=27.88s)]
*  that were working on a response to the avian flu outbreak, the bird flu outbreak, which, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=37.2s)]
*  by the way, Trump might wanna get a handle on because that is one of the main reasons [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=43.04s)]
*  why there's so much inflation in grocery stores, grocery prices. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=48.22s)]
*  So when there's testing for avian flu among chickens, if one chicken, for instance, tests [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=53.68s)]
*  positive, they end up having to kill all the chickens in that group. And that's led to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=61.72s)]
*  a shortage of eggs, that has led to inflation as it pertains to egg prices. Now, the agency [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=67.02s)]
*  is scrambling to reverse the firings. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=73.66s)]
*  A USDA spokesperson said in a statement, although several positions supporting bird flu efforts [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=76.56s)]
*  were notified of their terminations over the weekend, we are working to swiftly rectify [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=82.44s)]
*  the situation and rescind those letters. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service frontline [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  positions are considered public safety positions, and we are continuing to hire the workforce [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=93.38s)]
*  necessary to ensure the safety and adequate supply of food to fulfill our statutory mission. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=99.42s)]
*  But look, this is something that I'll say, some might argue, whatever. I mean, their [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=106.6s)]
*  termination letters were rescinded. Why are you freaking out? What's the big deal? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=111.96s)]
*  I'm just gonna say, if I were in their position, I wouldn't feel comfortable taking a federal job [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=115.56s)]
*  knowing how unstable the situation is. These are human beings. Many of them have children, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=124.52s)]
*  families to take care of, food to put on the table. Why would you wanna deal with the constant fear [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=131.56s)]
*  of potentially losing your job at any moment because of Elon Musk and Doge? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=137.16s)]
*  So I don't know if these people are gonna go back to their post after the decision to rescind the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=142.84s)]
*  termination letters, but this isn't the way you do things. Again, this is the federal government. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=147.96s)]
*  This isn't Twitter. This isn't a social media platform. It's far more serious than that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=153.24s)]
*  So maybe have a bit of a process rather than just coming in and taking a wrecking ball to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=158.04s)]
*  every federal agency, John. Yeah, and even if they do go back, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=164.2s)]
*  what, is it gonna be the same? You don't think they're gonna do the job a little bit differently, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  maybe go look for some other work? But they don't think about that because [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=173.64s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk, they don't think of workers as full people. They've never been [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=180.2s)]
*  that thing. They're just inconveniences. Workers are just a necessary evil until they're replaced [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=185.48s)]
*  by AI. In the case of Elon Musk, maybe engineers imported from India or whatever. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=191.48s)]
*  He's okay with that, I guess. But AI and robots. And until now, it's like, well, fire you and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=196.04s)]
*  you'll come back. You need it, right? You eat bread and soup or something and you need to pay [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=201.32s)]
*  for that. Okay, well, then you'll obviously take your job back and you'll be totally loyal. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=204.44s)]
*  It's just they don't have natural humanity and so they don't understand how humans work. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=207.64s)]
*  And my fear with something like Bird Flu, first of all, I'm surprised, I guess, that they did hire [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=214.6s)]
*  them back. I don't see why he'd be particularly worried about presiding over a terrible pandemic. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=219.32s)]
*  He got reelected after the first one. Why would we expect that he'd take the next one more serious? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=224.12s)]
*  You think Fox is gonna take it serious? You think MAGA is gonna do what's necessary to stay safe? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=228.44s)]
*  But with nuclear safety and stuff, it's like we're already seeing so many of these. FAA, they fired [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=232.44s)]
*  a bunch of people. USDA just lost a bunch of their food inspectors. We already didn't have nearly [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=237.0s)]
*  enough. Ocean inspectors, that's gonna be gone. That's not gonna exist in a year. And so Bird Flu [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=242.04s)]
*  that's the tragedy of the moment. But they're not gonna get to the sort of cuts that they want [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  without cutting a lot of people with truly critical roles, safeguarding us in a thousand [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=252.44s)]
*  different ways. And by the way, look, I know I keep harping on the price of eggs, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=257.24s)]
*  mostly because that's already impacted my household. So that's top of mind. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=263.0s)]
*  But the avian flu is a lot more serious than that, okay? Look at the beautiful eggs, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=266.6s)]
*  big beautiful eggs. Anyway, no, there's now evidence showing that avian flu is spreading [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=271.8s)]
*  among human beings. So the latest CDC tracking data suggests that the virus could be spreading [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=280.04s)]
*  among humans without even being detected. They've confirmed 68 cases among humans in the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=286.36s)]
*  United States so far. And within the past 10 days alone, three different states have reported new, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  known and likely bird flu infections in humans. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=299.0s)]
*  So this is a really big deal. And it's important to maintain the federal workers who are [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=302.52s)]
*  working really hard to find a solution to this. Not only to keep egg prices low or get them lower [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=309.32s)]
*  again, but also to protect actual human beings. And by the way, Doge's accidental firings are so [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=316.28s)]
*  egregious that even some Republicans remember that they might have a little bit of courage, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=321.88s)]
*  maybe a tiny little schmidge of testicular fortitude. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=328.52s)]
*  So Representative Don Bacon, a member of the Agriculture Committee, called them out saying [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  that they need to be more cautious. There's an old saying, measure twice, cut once. Well, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  they are measuring once, they're not even measuring in my opinion. And having to cut twice, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=345.88s)]
*  some of this stuff they're going to have to return back. I just wish they'd make a better [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=350.68s)]
*  decision upfront. Here, here, I totally agree with you on that. But will they? Probably not. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=356.68s)]
*  Similar mistake was made last week when the administration fired some nuclear safety [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=362.6s)]
*  employees. They tried to notify those staffers that they are actually going to be reinstated, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=367.16s)]
*  but struggled to find them because they didn't have their new contact information. So winning. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA20ED9JPjU&t=373.08s)]
