The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump Hits JD Vance With A DEVASTATING Blow
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI)
*  Do you view Vice President JD Vance as your successor? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, so that might seem like a layup, right? I mean, that's the President of the United States [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  getting asked a question about his vice president, the man he chose himself to be his vice president. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=10.08s)]
*  But you should never expect anything with Donald Trump. You should never predict anything because [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=17.6s)]
*  it's a little bit unpredictable. So let's hear how he answered that question from Brett Baer. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=22.72s)]
*  No, but he's very capable. I mean, I don't think that it, I think you have a lot of very capable [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=26.0s)]
*  people. So far, I think he's doing a fantastic job. It's too early, we're just starting. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=33.44s)]
*  But by the time you get to the midterms, he's gonna be looking for an endorsement. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=38.56s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people have said that this has been the greatest opening, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  almost three weeks in the history of the president. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=45.28s)]
*  That's what I've been the fastest and the most stuff. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=47.68s)]
*  I've done so much so fast. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=50.0s)]
*  So it's interesting that he answered that way. It's also fascinating that he answered that way, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  considering how Trump's base feels about JD Vance. They actually really like JD Vance. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=60.88s)]
*  He is very popular. I got news from the front. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=66.56s)]
*  Tell me. I talked to some right wingers who are not big fans of JD Vance. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=70.88s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=75.84s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't get into too much detail, but just a little bit of like, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=76.72s)]
*  I don't know that he's really one of us. He's kind of been, remember he went to Yale and he [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=82.88s)]
*  got funded by Silicon Valley donors like Peter Thiel, etc. So some of them know that. And so, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=88.48s)]
*  is he really a populist? Whereas when I mentioned, we got a poll on who do you think is actually [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=96.64s)]
*  gonna be Trump's successor. I'd probably vote someone else, it's in the live chat. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=101.28s)]
*  Because whenever I mentioned Josh Hawley, they're like, yes, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=105.76s)]
*  Hawley, yes. I mentioned JD Vance, like, jury's out. Interesting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  Hawley has been doing some good things in the Senate, pertaining to credit card, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  interest rate caps and things like that. He and Bernie Sanders worked together on a bipartisan [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=120.72s)]
*  bill. I don't think that bill is gonna pass with this Congress. But still, I mean, it is signaling [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  to the American people that Hawley is looking out for the economic interests of Americans to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=131.12s)]
*  some extent. But let's actually get to some of these polls, okay? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  So look, the good news for JD Vance is that he is actually popular with the Republican base, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=142.24s)]
*  based on some of the polling. So one recent poll found that 28% of Republican voters [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=147.52s)]
*  chose JD Vance as the successor to Donald Trump, or would prefer him to be the successor to Donald [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=154.16s)]
*  Trump. Coming in second place at 21%, Don Jr., which is concerning. But look at poor, poor Ronnie. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=160.24s)]
*  Ronnie D, only 8% of Republican voters chose Ronnie D. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  Take him to D. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  Some other candidates like Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy and Tim Scott only got a small number [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=178.56s)]
*  of votes. And then 24% of respondents said that they were undecided. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with Trump. And I think that it was a bold thing that he said. And I'm gonna give you [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  a little bit of context too against Trump in a second. But why? Why does he have to say that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  there's vice presidents definitely going to be a successor? That makes sense, I get it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=200.48s)]
*  I would have added more detail to soften the blow. I would have said, it's way too early for that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  And it's not my place to tell the voters who they should pick among so many great options, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=210.0s)]
*  That's the political and look diplomatic way of saying it. And I think the right way to say [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=216.72s)]
*  Trump, of course, is funny. He's like, no. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=221.52s)]
*  It a little less diplomatic for JD Vance, but interesting nonetheless. Now, of course, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=223.2s)]
*  now the criticism of Trump, when he wanted his last vice president murdered, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=230.64s)]
*  he probably doesn't have a great affinity or attachment to his vice presidents. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=237.44s)]
*  So his view of his partner is not quite the same as other past presidents. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=242.8s)]
*  True, and that is the antithesis of how Joe Biden treated his vice president. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=248.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, there's so many parallels. Real quick side note on this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=253.92s)]
*  between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump, massive, massive narcissist. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=258.32s)]
*  On the other hand, Joe Biden thinking that Donald Trump is a Nazi and is a threat to democracy, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=262.48s)]
*  but won't step aside even though he knows he has dementia. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=267.36s)]
*  I could argue that he's a bigger narcissist. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=271.12s)]
*  I don't wanna get into a long discussion about how much I despise Joe Biden, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  but I despise Joe Biden. Okay, very selfish, egotistical, narcissistic, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=281.04s)]
*  and played with everyone's lives. I mean, disgusting. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=287.12s)]
*  Absolutely, and then on this issue, Trump's worse, but Biden threw Kamala Harris under the bus. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=290.24s)]
*  She's in charge of the border, kind of whatever that means. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=296.56s)]
*  Borders are. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=298.88s)]
*  Yeah, borders, and I'm not giving her any, or whether he actually said that or not. But everybody [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  knew he put her in charge of don't come anymore, right? And then he knew that he wasn't giving her [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  any power, and they were gonna still come. Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  He threw her under the bus on purpose. And then by the way, if you guys don't know this, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=312.0s)]
*  Obama and Pelosi didn't want to annoy Kamala Harris, cuz they knew that she had issues. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=316.8s)]
*  And Biden screwed them over by half an hour after he dropped out. Yeah, I think it should [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=322.48s)]
*  be Kamala, cuz he thought Kamala would lose so he can go ha ha. He's such a terrible guy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=328.0s)]
*  Another in Trump when his chief of staff told him they're chanting, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=334.56s)]
*  hang Mike Pence, hang Mike Pence. Trump said he deserves it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=339.04s)]
*  You can't beat that, that's as bad as it gets. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=344.8s)]
*  That's all because of you guys. We love doing the show with our members. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZPClQ95HI&t=358.0s)]
