TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Dana White Warmly Welcoming Andrew Tate at UFC Event
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4)
*  Well, that's unfortunate UFC President Dana White gave Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=0.0s)]
*  a big warm welcome at a cage fighting event in Las Vegas over the weekend. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=16.56s)]
*  I say it's unfortunate, I like UFC, I'm entertained by it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=22.36s)]
*  I just don't like the toxicity of welcoming someone like Andrew Tate, but nonetheless, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  the Tate brothers, as some of you may already know, are under criminal investigation in Florida, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=33.92s)]
*  and have been charged with human trafficking in Romania. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=39.28s)]
*  Now, they were not supposed to travel outside of Romania until someone from the Trump [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=43.28s)]
*  administration pressured the Romanian government to allow the Tate brothers to travel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  They immediately traveled here to the United States where they thought that they would find [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  safe refuge, but turns out there's been a lot of backlash from some conservatives. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=56.96s)]
*  And I love to see that because to be quite honest with you, why would you want to support a guy [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=62.32s)]
*  who's on record over and over again, talking about victimizing women, beating women, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=69.6s)]
*  treating women the way he treats women allegedly. Now he's been charged with very serious charges [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=75.12s)]
*  like rape, human trafficking, and forming a criminal gang to exploit women. He has not been [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=81.68s)]
*  convicted of any of these charges, I want to be clear about that. And the UK was looking to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=86.88s)]
*  investigate him as well. Now, after the Tates return to the United States, Florida Governor [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Ron DeSantis said the brothers were not welcome in the Sunshine State. Let's take a look at that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=98.24s)]
*  Is he welcome here with the station? Is that back where I'm at here or whatever? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  The reality is, is no, Florida is not a place where you're welcome [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=108.48s)]
*  with that type of conduct in the air. And I don't know how it came to this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=115.12s)]
*  We were not involved, we were not notified. I found out through the media [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=119.44s)]
*  that this was something that was happening. Now, Andrew Tate responded to that by saying, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  DeSantis is just salty because I decided to endorse Byron Donalds, a Republican congressman, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=127.92s)]
*  to be the next governor of Florida. Rather than endorsing Casey DeSantis, Ron DeSantis' wife, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=135.52s)]
*  who apparently is going to run for governor and to try to be the successor to her husband. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=142.24s)]
*  We'll see how that plays out. But Byron Donalds was asked about this and I thought [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=147.36s)]
*  his take was fascinating to say the least. The current attorney general of Florida has [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=152.0s)]
*  announced he's opened a criminal investigation against Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=156.16s)]
*  Because in Romania, where they just came to Florida from, there were charges of rape, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=161.12s)]
*  sex with minor and trafficking, human trafficking. Do you support the attorney general's actions here? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  I do. I think those allegations have to be fully investigated and then we go from there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  The key thing is we don't tolerate the trafficking of women or frankly, the abuse of women. We do not [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=178.56s)]
*  tolerate that. So if the attorney general finds cause under Florida law to investigate that, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=185.36s)]
*  then I wish him the best and I support whatever he's gonna do on that matter. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  Are Andrew and Tristan Tate welcome in Florida? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  No, quite frankly not. Because if you listen to some of the dialogue, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=197.84s)]
*  I find it to be demeaning and disgusting. That's not about being an alpha male. It's not about [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  being a strong man. What they stand for, in my view, is something totally different. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=206.56s)]
*  Others who reacted with criticism toward Tate and the Tate brothers being in the United States [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  were Ben Shapiro, Megyn Kelly. So I'm glad that they're able to come out and say what needs to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  be said about the Tate brothers. They're awful. But now they're saying, the Tate brothers are saying [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  that we're gonna go back to Romania. After Florida's attorney general announced that the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=232.08s)]
*  state will be investigating the brothers, they claim that they're now going to leave and go back [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=237.36s)]
*  to Romania. Although honestly, I'm skeptical about that. But we'll see. We'll see what happens. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=242.0s)]
*  I'm curious what your take is, Was. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=246.8s)]
*  I'm amused every time a flare up happens within what is now a kind of broad coalition [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=249.84s)]
*  of MAGA supporters, right? You have these traditional Republicans and I think Ben Shapiro [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=256.8s)]
*  would count himself amongst them. These family values kind of guys and gals. This idea that the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=264.08s)]
*  left is so depraved and they're so sex crazed. And then you have this portion of people who [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=271.28s)]
*  are obsessed with the Epstein files and this concept of human trafficking and blah, blah, blah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=277.52s)]
*  But then you do have this new group of younger, disaffected male audience who are the Tate [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  audience. And I think what these Florida politicians are making a bet on is that there's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=289.76s)]
*  no actual political constituency for the Andrew Tates of the world. And also they know that no [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=294.4s)]
*  Democrats actually supporting this. So who are they actually fighting against on this? Nobody, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=301.68s)]
*  for real. And so I don't think they're taking some brave stance. I just think they know there's no [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=306.96s)]
*  actual constituency for this. But the fact that Tate feels like he's part of the coalition shows [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=311.36s)]
*  you how they've broadened this thing from traditional family values, God-bothering, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=316.72s)]
*  Jesus freak, conservative movement, conservative people to what it's become now into Donald Trump's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  era. Yeah, I think that's actually a really good point. It's easy to condemn the Tate brothers [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  when there's already a faction of the conservatives that don't like them. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=334.8s)]
*  But at the same time, I mean, you have Andrew Tate saying, I endorse Byron Donalds. Byron [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=340.48s)]
*  Donalds came out and was like, he's not welcome here. That's a good stance to take. He didn't [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=344.56s)]
*  melt over the idea that he got an endorsement from the Tates. But we'll see if he actually leaves [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=349.52s)]
*  the United States. Again, I'm skeptical of that because he's facing serious charges in Romania. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=355.68s)]
*  We'll fill you in as we learn more. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=361.2s)]
*  it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZtY5xPZ_H4&t=370.32s)]
