The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump Goes on BIZARRE Shark Rant During Signing Ceremony For Plastic Straw Executive Order
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A)
*  Next, this is an executive order [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=0.0s)]
*  relating to the use of paper [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=1.8s)]
*  straws. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=3.24s)]
*  As you've consistently identified, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=4.36s)]
*  nobody really likes paper straws. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=6.36s)]
*  Number one trending, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=8.08s)]
*  it's a ridiculous situation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=9.44s)]
*  So we're going back to plastic [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=11.68s)]
*  straws, I think it's okay. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=13.92s)]
*  And I don't think that plastic's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=16.2s)]
*  going to affect a shark very much [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=18.2s)]
*  as they're eating, as they're [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=20.16s)]
*  munching their way through [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=21.96s)]
*  the ocean. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=23.44s)]
*  I was going to say based until he [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=26.2s)]
*  made that shark statement. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=28.04s)]
*  I was like, why'd you have to ruin [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=29.8s)]
*  it? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=31.76s)]
*  Why'd you have to ruin it? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=32.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=33.76s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to get to the shark [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=34.28s)]
*  statement in a second. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  I'm only kind of kidding about [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=37.76s)]
*  the base part, although I really, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=39.68s)]
*  really, really, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=41.96s)]
*  really hate the paper straws. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=43.04s)]
*  We live in California, so [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  we've been dealing with the paper [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=45.56s)]
*  straws for a while now, Cenk. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=47.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm going to get to my [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=48.88s)]
*  opinions on paper straws in a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=50.64s)]
*  second because this is what [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=52.32s)]
*  the whole country is talking about. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=53.84s)]
*  Okay, that executive order was [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=55.8s)]
*  super important. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=57.36s)]
*  But we're asking you guys, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=58.16s)]
*  this one is so important. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=59.64s)]
*  We also put it up on tyt.com. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=61.4s)]
*  We put it up everywhere, but [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  it's also in the live chat. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=64.84s)]
*  So do you hate paper straws? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  Simple question, forget Trump, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  forget whether the executive order [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=70.72s)]
*  should happen, just do you hate [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  paper straws? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=73.72s)]
*  That's the only question, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=74.6s)]
*  yes or no, okay? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=75.44s)]
*  I'll get to my answer in a sec. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=76.56s)]
*  So let's get to the important [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=78.08s)]
*  details on this critical story that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=79.72s)]
*  everyone must know about. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=81.72s)]
*  So he, yes, he made that bizarre [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=83.2s)]
*  remark about sharks and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=85.6s)]
*  how they won't mind a little more [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  plastic pollution in their food. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=90.0s)]
*  And I'm going to address that in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  a second, but this is one of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  the lighter reversals from the Biden [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  administration that Trump is now [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=96.72s)]
*  doing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=98.68s)]
*  Obviously, he has reversed some of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=100.28s)]
*  the good things that Biden did [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=101.92s)]
*  through executive order. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  But this is how executive orders [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=104.44s)]
*  work, Democratic President does [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  something through executive order, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=107.56s)]
*  Republican President gets elected [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  next, he reverses it, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=110.92s)]
*  And it goes on and on and on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=112.84s)]
*  Congress is broken, they're the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=114.2s)]
*  ones who are supposed to legislate. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  But they can't be bothered to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=117.12s)]
*  legislate, they're too busy [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  fundraising and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=119.6s)]
*  screwing over the American people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=120.36s)]
*  Anyway, so the Biden [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=121.72s)]
*  administration last year had [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=123.44s)]
*  announced that it would gradually [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=125.84s)]
*  phase out single use plastics from [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=128.72s)]
*  food packaging, food packaging [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=131.6s)]
*  operations and events by 2027. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=134.6s)]
*  And from all federal operations by [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=137.68s)]
*  2035. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=140.76s)]
*  Now multiple US cities and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=141.68s)]
*  states have also adopted paper [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  straws or anti plastic straws as [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=146.66s)]
*  part of their policies to help [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=149.38s)]
*  the environment. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=151.62s)]
*  That includes the usual suspects, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=153.42s)]
*  right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=155.38s)]
*  So Seattle, California, Oregon, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  New Jersey, and this reversal from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=157.78s)]
*  Trump really isn't surprising. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=159.78s)]
*  Now Trump has been a very vocal [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  paper straw hater going as far as [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=164.14s)]
*  to sell Trump branded plastic [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=166.94s)]
*  straws during his 2020 presidential [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  campaign. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=173.14s)]
*  And it was really a deal, it was, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=174.48s)]
*  I mean only $15 for [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  a pack of 10 cheap red plastic [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=177.98s)]
*  straws. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  This brother, I mean, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=180.62s)]
*  he just cannot stop selling. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=182.18s)]
*  He's like a SNL character. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=184.82s)]
*  I mean, say I got straws here, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=186.9s)]
*  straws, 10 of them, plastic, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=188.82s)]
*  better than paper, $15. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=190.98s)]
*  For 10, over a dollar. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=193.66s)]
*  15 cents would be overpaying. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=195.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=197.9s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=199.34s)]
*  So look, he's very excited about [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=200.66s)]
*  his big straw win, it seems. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=202.66s)]
*  Posting this on X. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=204.98s)]
*  All right, it's a diet Coke with [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=207.14s)]
*  a red straw sticking out of it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=209.24s)]
*  Okay, but can't say the same for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=211.46s)]
*  America's number one straw hater, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=213.5s)]
*  though. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=215.78s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=216.34s)]
*  Women love masculinity and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  women do not love Tim Walls. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=219.98s)]
*  So that should just tell you about [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=222.46s)]
*  how masculine Tim Walls is. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=224.46s)]
*  The other day you saw him with [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=226.22s)]
*  a vanilla ice cream shake, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  had a straw in it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=229.66s)]
*  Again, that tells you everything. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=231.5s)]
*  On Monday, I covered Joe Biden's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  Thanksgiving trip to Nantucket. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=235.3s)]
*  He polar plunged at a little [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=237.02s)]
*  Black Friday shopping with Hunter [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=238.38000000000002s)]
*  and he called one of our [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=240.22s)]
*  correspondents stupid. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=241.34s)]
*  And we're willing to look past that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=243.38s)]
*  little outburst, but some things we [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=245.38s)]
*  just can't let slide. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=247.62s)]
*  Joe Biden used a straw. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=248.74s)]
*  Now if you've seen me on the five [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=251.46s)]
*  or on prime time, you know I [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=253.06s)]
*  recommend that all men refrain from [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=254.5s)]
*  using straws. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=256.3s)]
*  It's unbecoming, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=257.54s)]
*  the man's lips purse, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=259.02000000000004s)]
*  the size of the straw is just too [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=260.38s)]
*  dainty, the way your fingers [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=262.42s)]
*  clasp on it, no. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=264.48s)]
*  I'm sure Trump would agree that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=266.3s)]
*  wasn't a good look. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=267.5s)]
*  He's better than that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=268.58000000000004s)]
*  Is he better than that? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=271.42s)]
*  No, I mean, there's something [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=273.06s)]
*  slightly amusing by how mental [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=275.14000000000004s)]
*  Jesse Waters is. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=277.38s)]

*  men do X or all men shouldn't do Y, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  we apparently shouldn't drink [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  soup in public. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=284.5s)]
*  You have to do that in the closet. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, literally. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=287.1s)]
*  He picked out French onion soup in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  particular. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=291.58s)]
*  How often do you eat French onion [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=292.58s)]
*  soup at home? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  Because you mainly eat it at [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=294.94s)]
*  Bennegan's. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=296.58s)]
*  That's an old school reference. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  Okay, so anyways, this straw thing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=299.38s)]
*  and look, this guy, okay, look, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=301.73999999999995s)]
*  I shouldn't say it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=303.73999999999995s)]
*  I shouldn't say it, okay. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=304.85999999999996s)]
*  But when you're like, all men do [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  this and all men should be doing [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=308.26s)]
*  that instead, I'm like, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't know about your all men [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=311.85999999999996s)]
*  quotes, but anyways, look to each [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  is own. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=315.78s)]
*  So on the plastic issue, look, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=316.34s)]
*  Trump does some regular, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  gets rid of regulations that are [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=320.78s)]
*  really, really necessary. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=322.82s)]
*  He got to keep it real and serious. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=324.7s)]
*  He got rid of cleaning up lead in [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  the water. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=329.7s)]
*  That's a disaster, totally horrible, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=330.3s)]
*  right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=333.34s)]
*  But then he picked something like [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=334.78s)]
*  this that the whole country, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=336.34s)]
*  almost the whole country, well, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  we're going to find out in our [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  lecture, but they agrees on. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=340.38s)]
*  And he makes this the face of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=342.53999999999996s)]
*  over regulation. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=344.26s)]
*  And you got to confess, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=345.82s)]
*  confess, that's smart, okay? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=347.58s)]
*  So then he makes it look like all [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  regulation is not meant to protect [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=352.14s)]
*  you from bankers and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=354.21999999999997s)]
*  the lead industry, etc. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=355.5s)]
*  It's meant to protect you from [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=357.06s)]
*  paper straws. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  And so then he gets in the sharks [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=359.86s)]
*  for no reason, right? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=361.5s)]
*  But- Yeah, look, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=362.9s)]
*  the thing about the sharks, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  actually, it ruined it for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=364.98s)]
*  me a little bit. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  I do hate paper straws, but [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=367.82s)]
*  I understand why those types of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  bans were implemented because [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=371.82s)]
*  straws, plastic straws specifically [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=373.86s)]
*  are hurting marine life. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=376.34s)]
*  And so I get the reasoning and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=378.41999999999996s)]
*  rationale and the goody two shoe [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=380.61999999999995s)]
*  side of me wants to keep the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=383.2s)]
*  plastic straw ban in place in [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  places like California. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=387.41999999999996s)]
*  But then I thought about this, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=389.38s)]
*  Cenk, the reason why plastic ends [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=390.94s)]
*  up in the ocean is because we do [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=393.05999999999995s)]
*  have a culture problem in America [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=394.94s)]
*  and that culture problem is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=397.17999999999995s)]
*  littering, okay? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=399.09999999999997s)]
*  We just litter everywhere, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=400.94s)]
*  all the time. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=402.73999999999995s)]
*  You go to a country like Japan, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=404.26s)]
*  they don't have that problem. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=405.74s)]
*  In fact, they don't even have [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=406.86s)]
*  public trash cans in Japan. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=408.14s)]
*  Which is ironic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=409.86s)]
*  No, no, hold on, listen. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=410.78s)]
*  Because you would think at least [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=411.62s)]
*  some more littering. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  They literally, let's say they're [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=413.21999999999997s)]
*  eating something that was packaged [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=415.18s)]
*  in whatever, paper, plastic. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=417.09999999999997s)]
*  They keep the trash to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=418.78s)]
*  throw away at home. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=420.06s)]
*  They have a superior culture, Cenk. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=421.3s)]
*  They do when it comes to this. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=424.38s)]
*  Not overall. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=425.26s)]
*  Not overall. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=425.9s)]
*  On this. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=426.5s)]
*  So why, we could have plastic [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=427.26s)]
*  straws or at least we could keep [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=429.3s)]
*  them a little longer until we find [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=431.58s)]
*  a better solution than paper [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=433.98s)]
*  straws to replace them with. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=435.74s)]
*  And how about we just stop [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=437.74s)]
*  littering? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=438.58s)]
*  Isn't that a better option? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=439.08s)]
*  Yeah, look, I hear you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=440.82s)]
*  But so look, and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=442.42s)]
*  we've talked about this in the past. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=443.34s)]
*  Whenever the government says, now [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=445.42s)]
*  you should throw away your Coke [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=447.38s)]
*  cans, etc, etc. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=448.98s)]
*  We're not going to do anything as [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=449.98s)]
*  the government, but [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=451.62s)]
*  you chip away at it and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=452.74s)]
*  that'll affect 0.01% or whatever, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=454.06s)]
*  right? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=456.3s)]
*  I get a little annoyed. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=456.78s)]
*  The government should take big [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=458.9s)]
*  action on climate change. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=460.14s)]
*  But here, to be fair, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  they are taking big action on [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=462.70000000000005s)]
*  plastic and plastic is a giant [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=464.06s)]

*  It is. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=465.98s)]
*  And so they should. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=466.54s)]
*  But if I was president, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=468.02000000000004s)]
*  I'd handle this one because I know [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=468.98s)]
*  how much people hate paper straws. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=470.5s)]
*  Look, even in the live chat of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=472.1s)]
*  a progressive show, 57% saying they [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=473.90000000000003s)]

*  Only 52. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=478.46000000000004s)]
*  Okay, again, guys, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=479.98s)]
*  I'm not asking about the policy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=481.06s)]
*  I'm not asking you if you love [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=482.66s)]
*  plastic in the water, okay? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=484.3s)]

*  or dislike paper straws? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=488.38s)]
*  Every time I use a paper straw, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=490.42s)]
*  it melts, it tastes bad. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=492.18s)]
*  It's useless, you might as well [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=493.46s)]
*  just not use the straw at all. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=494.74s)]
*  In fact, whenever they give me [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=496.41999999999996s)]
*  a paper straw, I'm like, no, no, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=497.46s)]
*  don't, don't, don't, don't. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=498.58s)]

*  So, but here's what I would do. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=502.62s)]
*  Guys, I'd do a press conference and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=506.09999999999997s)]
*  I'd say, guys, we've got to do [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=507.82s)]
*  something about plastic. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=509.3s)]
*  And I would list all the reasons [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=510.62s)]
*  why it's important that we do [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=512.62s)]
*  regulation on plastics. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=514.26s)]
*  And then I would say, but [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=516.1s)]
*  I'm going to exempt straws, okay? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=517.34s)]
*  And because the country hates [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=520.18s)]
*  paper straws, and I am the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=522.1s)]
*  representative of the people. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=523.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=525.74s)]
*  And the people have spoken, right? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=526.26s)]
*  I have to, I'm an idiot, so [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=527.26s)]
*  I got to do a fact check. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=529.3s)]
*  Japan ranks second in the world [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=532.3s)]
*  regarding plastic waste [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=534.22s)]

*  Okay, but you are- [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=537.82s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=539.22s)]
*  Why can't the Japanese be more [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=539.82s)]
*  like America? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=541.02s)]

*  you're right about litter, but [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=548.14s)]
*  that doesn't mean they don't throw, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=549.94s)]
*  they don't overuse plastic, etc. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=552.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=553.78s)]

*  there's answers too. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=558.58s)]
*  We just have to get to a place [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=559.7s)]

*  productive answers. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=562.7s)]
*  Because, so paper doesn't work, but [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=563.82s)]
*  it doesn't mean we have to go [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4fb8rLS3A&t=565.94s)]
