"The Israeli military this weekend deployed tanks to the occupied West Bank for the first time in two decades.

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Israeli Official Blatantly ADMITS They‚Äôre Ethnically Cleansing The West Bank
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM)
*  It's the first since 2002. Israeli tanks deployed in the occupied West Bank as part of an extensive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=0.0s)]
*  military operation launched on January the 21st. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=6.82s)]
*  says the operation, dubbed Iron Wall, aims to quote defeat terrorism. The fighting is [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  taking a heavy toll on the local population. According to the UN, some 40,000 people from [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=18.68s)]
*  several refugee camps have fled their homes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=24.5s)]
*  Two days after the Gaza ceasefire deal went into effect, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=27.84s)]
*  Netanyahu and the right wing Israeli government turned their focus and attention to the West [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=33.18s)]
*  Bank. And now for the first time in decades since 2002, tanks have been deployed to Jenin [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=39.68s)]
*  and other refugee camps to essentially drive Palestinians out. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=46.84s)]
*  And I wanna be clear, that is the whole objective here. They're not even trying to hide it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  So Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=56.12s)]
*  ordered the military to increase the intensity of the activity to thwart terrorism in all [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=61.8s)]
*  refugee camps in the West Bank. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  Now there has to be fair, and there's been an increase in Palestinian attacks coming [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=71.25999999999999s)]
*  from the West Bank. So for instance, on Thursday, three empty buses exploded in Israel in what [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=78.36s)]
*  police say was an attempted militant attack. However, let's also be clear in noting that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=84.92s)]
*  since the war began in Gaza after October 7th, there has been a lot of violence toward [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=91.8s)]
*  Palestinian civilians by Israeli settlers in the West Bank. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=99.36s)]
*  And so this has been going on since the beginning of the war. More than 800 Palestinians have [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=104.38s)]
*  been killed in the West Bank since the war in Gaza erupted on October 7th. Israel says [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=109.48s)]
*  most were militants, but stone throwing youths protesting Israeli raids as well as bystanders [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=115.28s)]
*  have also been killed, including by the way, an American citizen that we reported on last [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=121.88s)]
*  year. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=125.72s)]
*  In the most recent operation, a pregnant Palestinian woman was killed. Kind of hard to argue that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=126.72s)]
*  she's a militant. Now this weekend, the Israeli military also admitted its forces had killed [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=132.76s)]
*  two 13-year-old kids and that it was investigating the incident. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=138.88s)]
*  Sure, they'll get right on it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  Jenin's mayor says that Israel's military had also raised at least 120 residential buildings [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=146.52s)]
*  and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. Now, let's actually get to the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=153.8s)]
*  veil being lifted. They're flat out telling the truth here. Now, Israel Cats is outright [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  admitting that they intended to go beyond just killing people. They plan to ethnically [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  cleanse the territory as well. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  He says, quote, we will not allow the return of residents and we will not allow terrorism [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=175.24s)]
*  to return and grow. Earlier, Cats said he had instructed the military to prepare for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=180.8s)]
*  an extended stay in some of the West Bank's urban refugee camps from which about 40,000 [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=186.56s)]
*  Palestinians have fled, leaving them emptied of residence. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=193.6s)]
*  And I just wanna also note that he says that Israeli troops would stay for the coming year. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=198.04s)]
*  In addition to that, DropSite News is reporting that Israeli Deputy Knesset Speaker Nassim [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=204.24s)]
*  Vatturi, who's part of the Likud party, told radio station Kol Barama that all Palestinian [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=210.56s)]
*  men in Gaza should be wiped out. He says the following, and I'm quoting, who is innocent [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=217.96s)]
*  in Gaza? Civilians went out and slaughtered people in cold blood. We need to separate [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=226.0s)]
*  the children and women and kill the adults in Gaza. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=231.96s)]
*  We are being too considerate. He also says we will soon turn to Janine or we will soon [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  turn Janine into Gaza. He said, adding that the Palestinian captives released under the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=240.4s)]
*  Gaza ceasefire deal should be sent there so they can be eliminated by Israeli forces. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=245.48s)]
*  Erase Janine. Don't start looking for the terrorists. If there's a terrorist in a house, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=253.04s)]
*  take it out. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=258.12s)]
*  Yeah, because if you start looking for the terrorists, you run into Nassim Vatturi, who [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=258.72s)]
*  is clearly a terrorist. We're sending money to an Israeli government filled with terrorists. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=263.12s)]
*  Ben Gavir is a terrorist. This guy's obviously is celebrating terrorism. He's saying we should [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=268.52s)]
*  murder the citizens. That is the definition of terrorism. But in Israel, that's not remarkable. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=274.36s)]
*  The idea of killing innocent Palestinians seems to be widely accepted. No problem at [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=284.72s)]
*  all. There are tons of cabinet ministers constantly talking about killing them all, ethnically [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=290.32s)]
*  cleansing them, moving them out, driving them into the desert, etc. And they're still in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=295.24s)]
*  the desert. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=301.28s)]
*  We're sending money to a terrorist government. So look, let's talk about the different things [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  that Israel has done to violate the ceasefire in Gaza, because that's the second part of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=308.2s)]
*  the story. So they did not remove themselves from the Philadelphia corridor. That was one [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=313.08s)]
*  of the parts of the agreement. So they were supposed to, and when I saw that, I was like, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  really? They're going to leave some of the land that they're occupying in Gaza. I'd be [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=325.32s)]
*  very surprised by that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=329.84s)]
*  And of course, I was right. They're not gonna leave any of the land. The whole point is [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=331.11999999999995s)]
*  to steal land. It was never about self-defense. That's been a giant lie and abuse of propaganda [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  by Israel. Calling dead children collateral damage is propaganda by Israel. It's a vicious [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  form of terrorism that Israel does, that they not only kill the children, but then they [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=348.4s)]
*  smear them later as like, well, they were near terrorists, so they were collateral damage. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=353.4s)]
*  I was moral in the way that I slaughtered them. No, you weren't. You were despicably [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=358.48s)]
*  immoral. So they did not leave the land, of course. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  Number two, they were supposed to negotiate the second part of the ceasefire and a permanent [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=366.8s)]
*  truce. Netanyahu did not send a single negotiator and had never had any intention of negotiating [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=372.96s)]
*  for a long-term peace. Exactly what we told you on the show, because he's not interested [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=379.2s)]
*  in peace. He's interested in war, colonial expansion, land acquisition, and land theft. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=383.64s)]
*  And he's end slaughtering more innocent Palestinians, because he is one of the worst terrorists [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=392.36s)]
*  of our lifetimes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=397.32s)]
*  Okay, number three, the prisoner swap. That's supposed to be the heart of the agreement [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  here. Hamas returns the hostages, and Israel's supposed to return what they call prisoners, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=405.0s)]
*  but an overwhelming majority of them are just hostages, because they do these giant [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=411.18s)]
*  roundups. They don't even charge them with any crimes. And then they go, if you want [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=415.22s)]
*  your hostages back, the ones that we humiliated and took away their freedom and destroy their [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=419.54s)]
*  lives. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=424.5s)]
*  Or raped in some cases. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=425.5s)]
*  And some of them raped. Well, then you're gonna have to give me some hostages back or [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=427.3s)]
*  whatever else that I want. I hate hostage taking on either side. It's super easy for [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=431.98s)]
*  me to condemn what Hamas has done. And let's talk about the Bebas family. So that's the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=439.70000000000005s)]
*  two young kids who were killed by Hamas. They're returning the bodies. They're pretending to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=443.90000000000003s)]
*  return the body of their mom. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=450.02000000000004s)]
*  It turns out it's not their mom. So that's a violation of the ceasefire from Hamas's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=451.5s)]
*  side. And the way that they parade them around in front of the crowds, the coffins, was disgusting. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=456.18s)]
*  By the way, the idiots at Hamas, every time I see what they do, I think, God, you are [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=462.58000000000004s)]
*  so monumentally stupid. So everything they do makes it harder to get a Palestinian state. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=468.26s)]
*  So what do you think? The world is ready to have enormous sympathy for the Palestinians [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=475.58s)]
*  and does. And these morons at Hamas come and ruin that sympathy by acting in the most barbaric [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=480.12s)]
*  and immoral way. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=487.78s)]
*  So easy for me to condemn them. Now I'm gonna ask for those of you who are Israeli supporters, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=489.74s)]
*  do you do likewise for Israel? Do you condemn the 14,500 children that Israel has slaughtered? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=496.38s)]
*  Or do you make nonsense excuses about, well, they're just collateral damage. They were [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=507.06s)]
*  just human shields. Hamas had it coming. The Palestinians had it coming. They didn't agree [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  with Hamas anyway. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=514.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, you agree with your government. Does this justify slaughtering your children? No, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=515.86s)]
*  it doesn't. And it doesn't justify slaughtering Palestinian children. 14,500 kids is not a [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=520.86s)]
*  mistake that is done on purpose to terrorize the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BldMvBt2aM&t=527.9s)]
