TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Epstein Files Stunt Backfires In A BIG Way For Pam Bondi
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw)
*  Would you declassify the Epstein files? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I would. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=2.88s)]
*  The DOJ may be releasing the list of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=6.68s)]
*  Will that really happen? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=8.88s)]
*  It's sitting on my desk right now to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=10.48s)]
*  review. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=12.32s)]
*  I think the American people are very [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=12.92s)]
*  curious about who's on this list or [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=14.84s)]
*  these lists. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=16.76s)]
*  You have been doggedly trying to get [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=17.84s)]
*  all the information. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=20.32s)]
*  And now we learn thanks to you that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=21.96s)]
*  you've been stonewalled by people in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=24.8s)]
*  New York. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=27.96s)]
*  Do you want to explain that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  Do you want to explain that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=32.48s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=34.28s)]
*  Now she's certainly attempted to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=36.36s)]
*  after failing to deliver the goods [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=38.84s)]
*  in this highly publicized stunt. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=41.34s)]
*  Where conservative influencers were [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=44.24s)]
*  given binders full of pretty [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  much nothing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=48.8s)]
*  There were no Epstein files only [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=49.8s)]
*  publicly available information [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  about the Jeffrey Epstein case. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=54.76s)]
*  And now Attorney General Pam Bondi [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  is saying that she actually has [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  received a massive document dump. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=62.36s)]
*  They call them dumps, big dumps, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=64.8s)]
*  from the FBI and will in fact be [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=66.92s)]
*  releasing all of these dirty [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=68.84s)]
*  details very, very soon. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=70.64s)]
*  But look, before we get to those [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=72.28s)]
*  details, here's a refresher on what [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=74.08s)]
*  happened. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=76.28s)]
*  Pam Bondi was hyping up the release [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=76.84s)]
*  of Jeffrey Epstein's black book [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=79.0s)]
*  quite a bit last week. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=80.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=82.44s)]
*  I think tomorrow, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=84.12s)]
*  the personal information of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=85.16s)]
*  the victims, other than that, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  I think tomorrow, Jesse, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=88.64s)]
*  breaking news right now, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  you're going to see some Epstein [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=91.76s)]
*  information being released by my [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  office. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  What kind? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=96.36s)]
*  Are we going to see who was on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=96.92s)]
*  the flights? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Are we going to see any evidence [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=99.72s)]
*  from what he recorded because he [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=101.48s)]
*  had all of his homes wired with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  recording devices? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what you're going to see, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=106.64s)]
*  hopefully tomorrow, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=109.0s)]
*  is a lot of flight logs, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=110.72s)]
*  a lot of names, a lot of information. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=112.48s)]
*  But it's pretty sick what that man [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=115.44s)]
*  did. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  Now, literally the next day, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=121.0s)]
*  Bondi carried out this stunt with [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=123.36s)]
*  the conservative influencers, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=126.08s)]
*  gave them binders that were [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=128.8s)]
*  supposed to be part of the Epstein [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=130.88s)]
*  files release, part one. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=133.48s)]
*  But really, all they contained were [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=135.52s)]
*  things like his contact book, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=138.4s)]
*  a redacted masseuse list. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=140.84s)]
*  And much of this was already [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=143.92s)]
*  public, so [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=145.68s)]
*  there was nothing new involved. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  But what's crazy, Cenk, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=148.12s)]
*  is that now ABC News is reporting [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=150.4s)]
*  that Attorney General Bondi did [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=153.16s)]
*  this without communicating with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=155.84s)]
*  the White House at all. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=158.72s)]
*  She apparently thought that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  the Trump administration would love [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=162.72s)]
*  this, and I don't think they did. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=164.68s)]
*  So this is what ABC News reports, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=166.92s)]
*  ahead of the Justice Department's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=168.8s)]
*  public release, Bondi directed her [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=170.88s)]
*  to compile binders of the materials [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=173.12s)]
*  to distribute to the influencers at [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  the event, sources said. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=177.24s)]
*  She also instructed her team not to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  inform White House officials of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=181.08s)]
*  the plan, according to multiple [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=183.36s)]
*  sources, apparently thinking [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  the surprise would be well [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=188.0s)]
*  received inside the West Wing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=189.78s)]
*  It gets better though. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=192.0s)]
*  Behind the scenes, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=193.68s)]
*  Trump White House officials pointed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=194.94s)]
*  the finger at Bondi, who they say [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=197.24s)]
*  quietly arranged the release without [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=199.08s)]
*  notifying senior staff, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  multiple sources told ABC News. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=202.56s)]
*  If you're going to do a stunt, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  you got to actually carry it out [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=207.84s)]
*  and deliver the goods. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=209.44s)]
*  She didn't do that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  So why would you think the White [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=211.8s)]
*  House would be celebrating you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=213.44s)]
*  carrying this out without even [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  talking to them about it ahead of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  time? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=218.56s)]
*  But there's also the other [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=219.52s)]
*  possibility here, Cenk, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=221.0s)]
*  which is maybe the White House is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=222.56s)]
*  embarrassed by it and wants to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  distance themselves from Bondi. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=226.24s)]
*  So they're claiming that she did [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=228.56s)]
*  this unilaterally without [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=230.24s)]
*  consulting with the White House. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=231.64s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=233.27999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's possible and a lot of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=234.32s)]
*  people were mad at Pam Bondi when [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  she did this stunt and it turns [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=237.44s)]
*  out it's information we already [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=239.04s)]
*  knew. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  So they might be trying to distance [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=241.2s)]
*  themselves from it, but [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=242.92s)]
*  it doesn't really matter because [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  the bottom line is, are they going [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  to release the actual files or [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  are they not? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  And the answer is, of course not. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=249.76s)]
*  So first of all, I want everybody [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  to keep your eyes on the actual [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=254.0s)]
*  thing that people want because [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=256.24s)]
*  they're trying to do a switcheroo [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=258.4s)]
*  on you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=260.96s)]
*  So they went from saying, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=262.08s)]
*  the Epstein files are going to be [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=263.6s)]
*  released to the Epstein customer [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=265.36s)]
*  list is going to be released. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=267.24s)]
*  But wait a minute, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=268.92s)]
*  that's not the main thing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=269.8s)]
*  The main thing is the tapes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=271.0s)]
*  He's got all these folks on tape. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=273.52s)]
*  And who hired him? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=275.48s)]
*  Did anybody hire him? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=277.2s)]
*  Did anybody kill him? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=278.68s)]
*  Who killed him? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=279.84s)]
*  Why was the camera out that day? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=280.76s)]
*  Why were the guards gone that day? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=283.32s)]
*  Why did they move his cellmate out? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=284.84s)]
*  There's all these questions. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=286.4s)]
*  And now, and every time she's doing [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=287.8s)]
*  an appearance, she's just saying, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=289.24s)]
*  the client list, the client list, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=290.8s)]
*  which is largely already known. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  Okay, so you're not going to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=294.36s)]
*  release any information. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=295.76s)]
*  And so, look, are there two people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=297.16s)]
*  in the Trump administration on [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  the contact list already? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=301.44s)]
*  The contact book we've seen, yes. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  One is the President, Trump, and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=305.64s)]
*  the other is Bobby Kennedy Jr., [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=308.32s)]
*  head of Health and Human Services. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=310.88s)]
*  So are they going to be excited [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=313.76s)]
*  that Pam Bondi wanted to release [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=316.0s)]
*  that? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=319.2s)]
*  And then, of course, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=321.16s)]
*  there's the issue of who actually [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=322.2s)]
*  did kill Epstein and was powerful [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=324.04s)]
*  enough to get away with it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=326.12s)]
*  And as I've said before, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=328.92s)]
*  I know only one force on Earth that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=330.6s)]
*  is powerful enough to do that and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=332.8s)]
*  get both the Democrats and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  the Republicans to shut up about it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  And hey, look at that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=338.8s)]
*  Didn't Trump and Kennedy Jr. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=341.0s)]
*  just put out statements yesterday [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=343.04s)]
*  about how Israel needs to be [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=344.92s)]
*  protected? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=346.6s)]
*  Yeah, look, there's a lot of, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=348.36s)]
*  some would call it, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  speculation going on. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=351.76s)]
*  But I hear what you're saying. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  I do want to just note that, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=355.76s)]
*  I feel like at this point, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  because of the fact that the Trump [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=359.32s)]
*  administration really does flood [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=361.6s)]
*  the zone with all sorts of crazy [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=363.8s)]
*  news stories, Bondi would probably [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=365.76s)]
*  do well in just dropping this and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=368.2s)]
*  not continuing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  I can tell she feels the need to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=371.44s)]
*  explain herself. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=373.56s)]
*  So the latest is this claim that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=375.8s)]
*  she received a truckload of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=378.56s)]
*  documents. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=381.36s)]
*  So I want to go to that video. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=382.72s)]
*  This is G4. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=384.36s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=385.48s)]
*  You know, Sean, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  I gave them a deadline of Friday at [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=388.48s)]
*  8am to get us everything. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  And a source had told me where [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=392.24s)]
*  the documents were being kept, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=394.04s)]
*  Southern District of New York [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=395.92s)]
*  shock. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=397.64s)]
*  So we got them all by hopefully all [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=398.36s)]
*  of them Friday at 8am, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=400.48s)]
*  thousands of pages of documents. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  I have the FBI going through them [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=404.6s)]
*  and cash is also, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  now that we have cash here, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  it's a game changer, of course. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=408.92s)]
*  And cash is going to, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=410.68s)]
*  Director Patel is going to get us [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=411.88000000000005s)]
*  a detailed report as to why the FBI [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  withheld all of those documents. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=416.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=418.88000000000005s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=421.0s)]
*  So we will patiently wait for [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  Bondi, who has not given us [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  a timeline for when she's going to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=424.76000000000005s)]
*  release all this newly found [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=426.68s)]
*  information to do so. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=428.48s)]
*  We'll see when she does that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  But I'm going to go ahead and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=431.72s)]
*  guess that that's not going to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=433.24s)]
*  happen. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=434.8s)]
*  Yeah, look, again, if you're [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=436.76s)]
*  powerful enough to kill someone [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=438.44s)]
*  inside a US prison and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=440.24s)]
*  get away with it, you're powerful [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=441.47999999999996s)]
*  enough to make sure those files [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=443.44s)]
*  are never released. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  Assuming he was killed, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=446.44s)]
*  we don't know for sure. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=447.44s)]
*  I'm just doing my due diligence. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=448.44s)]
*  But again, I hear you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=449.84s)]
*  I agree with your speculation, but [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=451.88s)]
*  yeah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  It is possible, it is technically [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=455.12s)]
*  possible that both the guards [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=457.08s)]
*  happen to be off. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  The camera happened to be not [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=459.64s)]
*  working at the time. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=461.4s)]
*  The NSL made all transferred out [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=462.68s)]
*  at the exact moment that he [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=464.4s)]
*  decided to commit suicide. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  It is entirely possible. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=467.08s)]
*  It is also much more possible that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=468.44s)]
*  that's exactly what you would do if [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=470.2s)]
*  you wanted to kill him. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  Anyways, even if they release [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=473.08s)]
*  something, guys, I mean, so [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=475.08s)]
*  easy to release some of it and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=477.12s)]
*  not the parts that tell you who [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=479.08s)]
*  actually did it, super easy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  So that's what's, at the end, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=483.52s)]
*  they're going to give you some [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=485.2s)]
*  sort of halfway nothing burger and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=486.8s)]
*  pretend that's the whole thing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=488.64s)]
*  Because these folks are just too [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=490.64s)]
*  powerful. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=492.36s)]
*  You're never going to be able to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=493.16s)]
*  get that information until there's [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=494.8s)]
*  someone who's president who is not [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=496.8s)]
*  implicated in the Epstein files. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=498.8s)]
*  And that might take a long time. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=501.12s)]
*  I don't think that's going to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=502.72s)]
*  appease right wing figures like [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  Laura Loomer, for instance. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=506.24s)]
*  Because she's been super vocal in [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=507.8s)]
*  her rage over what Bondi has done [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  or failed to do, right? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=512.96s)]
*  So I don't think you're going to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=514.88s)]
*  trick Laura Loomer. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaBJCapyqw&t=516.72s)]
