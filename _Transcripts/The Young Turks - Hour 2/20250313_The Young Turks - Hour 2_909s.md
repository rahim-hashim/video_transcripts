TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Alan Dershowitz's HORRIFIC Statement About Mahmoud Khalil
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo)
*  Chuck Schumer doesn't think he committed any crime. What say you? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, he certainly committed a lot of moral offenses. He's a despicable, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=3.2s)]
*  horrible person. He should be kept away from his wife and his baby the way he kept [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=8.8s)]
*  Israelis away from a supported Hamas killing children, killing babies. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=13.84s)]
*  He's not somebody who should be admired or supported. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=20.32s)]
*  Rich coming from Alan Dershowitz. If there's anyone in the country, we should never hear [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=23.2s)]
*  anything about moral issues about. It's from Alan Dershowitz, okay? He's not exactly the best [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=31.28s)]
*  arbiter of what is and isn't moral. But nonetheless, Harvard Law School professor [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  and Jeffrey Epstein lawyer, Alan Dershowitz thinks that Mahmoud Khalil, the pro-Palestinian [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=45.04s)]
*  student from Columbia who was detained by ICE and could have his green card revoked for [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=51.84s)]
*  engaging in the crime of protest, deserves to be kept away from his pregnant wife. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=59.6s)]
*  She's eight months pregnant and soon to be newborn baby. So he's of course referring to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=67.04s)]
*  Khalil who was arrested and faces deportation after protesting Israel despite having a green [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=71.76s)]
*  card. President Donald Trump heralded Khalil's arrest as the first of many to come, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=77.12s)]
*  vowing on social media to deport students he said engage in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=83.92s)]
*  anti-American activity. There is no indication that Khalil himself did any such thing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  There's no indication that he committed any such crime. In fact, we keep talking about how [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=95.92s)]
*  what's happening to him is a violation of free speech, but it's also a violation of due process. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Yes. Now, if a green card holder is about to have his green card revoked, that needs to be decided [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  and adjudicated by a federal judge. And that has not happened in this case. But they have yet to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=113.84s)]
*  show even a shred of evidence that Khalil was pro-terrorist or a threat to Americans. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=119.84s)]
*  Accusations his lawyer flat out denies. Let's watch. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  Is there any evidence that your client ever communicated with, emailed, talked to, texted, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=129.28s)]
*  tweeted with Hamas that he worked in any kind of coordination with Hamas? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Mahmoud is a human rights defender. He has been, he himself is born of refugees from Tiberias, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  Palestine, was born and raised in a refugee camp in Syria and has worked his entire life [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=148.56s)]
*  to defend human rights and to defend Palestinian rights. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=155.76s)]
*  There's no reason to believe and I don't think anybody who knows him would argue otherwise [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=161.92s)]
*  or suggest that he would have any connection with any of these entities. But that's also [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=168.48s)]
*  not what he stands for. That would be completely opposite to his values. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=176.16s)]
*  So let me just also note that he has, to be clear, the Trump administration isn't even accusing Khalil [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=180.4s)]
*  of a crime. However, a story just broke in regard to Trump administration officials making some [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=190.32s)]
*  interesting claims about Khalil. One says that basically a reporter asks, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=196.88s)]
*  how did he support Hamas? At least explain to us how exactly did Khalil support Hamas? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=204.96s)]
*  And at that point, Department's Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Troy Edgar basically says, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  well, I think you can see it on TV, right? This is somebody that we've invited and allowed the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=219.12s)]
*  student to come into the country and he's put himself in the middle of the process of basically [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=224.24s)]
*  pro-Palestinian activity. So basically nothing, nothing. Okay, this is what the Trump administration [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=228.88s)]
*  is doing on behalf of Israel and pro-Israel Americans who donated to his campaign. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=237.68s)]
*  He is honestly, he's a transactional president. You give him hundreds of millions of dollars as [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=243.44s)]
*  the Adelsons have, he's gonna do whatever the Adelsons want him to do, including engage in this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=249.92s)]
*  disgusting witch hunt against any student protester who has moral issues with what [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=256.4s)]
*  Israel is doing in the slaughtering of tens of thousands of innocent civilians [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  in both Gaza and the West Bank. That's what's happening here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=266.32s)]
*  And it's sick because our president should be serving the American people, not a foreign [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=269.52s)]
*  government. Instead, he's violating the rights of people who are in this country legally and of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=273.44s)]
*  American citizens, specifically to appease his daddy, Bibi Netanyahu. It's disgusting. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=279.12s)]
*  Anyway, Was, what do you think? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, folks need to understand that this is essentially the Patriot Act come home the roost. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=287.76s)]
*  Thank you, Was. Thank you. This is neoconservatism, right? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=296.32s)]
*  That's precisely what it is. And don't think for a second that, well, he's a green card holder. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=299.76s)]
*  This couldn't happen to me. No, don't think that for a second. They will find the justification [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=307.12s)]
*  so long as they can use the framing of terrorism and you vaguely having something to do with it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=312.32s)]
*  They will find a justification to do something like this to you too. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=320.16s)]
*  This is not hyperbole. This is just straight up, I mean, the Patriot Act on its face is just straight [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=323.92s)]
*  up authoritarian and fascist is all hell. There's just no doubt about it. And we've had brushes with [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=330.72s)]
*  this kind of stuff in the past, stuff like Japanese internment. I think about the freaking [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=337.68s)]
*  red scare with McCarthyism, where just straight up the rule of law or just due process this idea [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=343.92s)]
*  that you can just be accused and it's over. This stuff is scary stuff. We mentioned on the last [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=352.48s)]
*  segment, like, yo, there's certain things that we don't need to ring the alarm until something [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=358.72s)]
*  horrible happens. This is an alarm ringer, y'all. This is about as bad as it gets. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=362.8s)]
*  And I promise you, if somebody was on, and this is the craziest part. If you're a Trump lover that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't get, if somebody was on the NYU campus or Columbia campus, excuse me, and was like, well, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't like how we're prosecuting the civil war in Somalia as the US. I don't like our policy [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=381.76000000000005s)]
*  towards Iran. I don't like several different things that the US government is doing as an [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=389.12s)]
*  American citizen, as a green card holder. I'm not feeling what we're doing abroad. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=395.2s)]
*  I don't like the way our military is conducting its business, the killing machine. Not a P, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=400.96s)]
*  people do it every single day. I promise you, you can go to DC right now. There are people [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=406.16s)]
*  protesting the actions of the United States government. No problem, nobody cares. The [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=411.92s)]
*  second people step up and have a critique for the Israeli government, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=417.84s)]
*  we're just doing Gestapo stuff. It's crazy. It's crazy. And the idea that this isn't gonna feed [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=423.91999999999996s)]
*  the worst and most disgusting stereotypes and anti-Semitism. What do they think is gonna be [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=430.47999999999996s)]
*  the result of this? I know. Yeah, that's a really great point, actually, right? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=437.67999999999995s)]
*  Like it only fires up those people, like the anti-Semitic people. And it's not going, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=442.16s)]
*  if you think that censoring speech is going to make that speech go away, you are mistaken. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  If anything, it draws more attention to those ideas. And it's kind of like the Streisand [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=458.0s)]
*  effect, right? Because now we're constantly talking about this Columbia University student who [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  was denied his due process, has been punished for his free speech rights as a green card holder, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=469.12s)]
*  a permanent resident of the United States. And by the way, the White House official or [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=475.2s)]
*  a White House official told the free press that Khalil is a threat to the foreign policy and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=479.92s)]
*  national security interests of the United States. The allegation here is not that he was breaking [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  the law. So in other words, we're just violating his speech rights and leaning into [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=490.88s)]
*  neo-conservative garbage talking points in the aftermath of 9-11 to drum up support among the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=499.44s)]
*  American people in essentially dismantling their constitutional rights. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=506.08s)]
*  Because if you think this stops at Khalil, you are wrong. This impacts all of us, which is why [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=510.88s)]
*  I remember when during COVID, there were the Canadian truckers who were protesting and the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=516.8s)]
*  Canadian government came down pretty hard on them. But then there were some protesters, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=522.88s)]
*  similar protesters here in the United States. And as long as they're not harming people and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=526.96s)]
*  actually breaking laws or getting violent, I mean, we supported it even though we didn't [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=532.88s)]
*  necessarily agree with the core of their message. And it's because freedom of expression is what [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=537.6s)]
*  makes this country great. Being able to speak the truth about what you're experiencing, get together, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  freedom of assembly, all of that stuff should be protected. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=551.84s)]
*  And if you think that this isn't gonna affect you as Was said, because you're [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=554.48s)]
*  an American citizen, whether it be naturalized or you were born here. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=558.16s)]
*  You're crazy. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=561.12s)]
*  You're crazy, absolutely. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=562.08s)]
*  By the way, I don't know, I haven't checked, but have the heterodox folks, the free speech warriors, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=564.16s)]
*  have they stepped up to the plate yet? I haven't looked, but I haven't noticed any rabble rousing [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=570.0s)]
*  on the part of the Elon Musk, the free speech warrior himself. Where's he at on this? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=575.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, the free press, as you can imagine, is very hawkish in favor of Israel. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=581.76s)]
*  So anyway, but let's get back to unfortunately Dershowitz, who was even forced to admit [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=589.2s)]
*  that it was very likely that the federal government will face serious legal challenges [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=596.32s)]
*  in what they're doing to Khalil. Let's take a look. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=602.8s)]
*  The statute is very, very unclear. He has to be convicted of a crime of moral turpitude. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=605.04s)]
*  He hasn't been convicted. He's probably committed crimes of moral turpitude. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=613.52s)]
*  There are two provisions of the statute. One require conviction of a crime of moral [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=618.24s)]
*  turpitude. That doesn't apply. The other is a much more general one that talks about the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  national security of the United States and supporting terrorism. He may also have lied [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=629.04s)]
*  on his application for a student visa or a green card when he said he doesn't support violence. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=633.92s)]
*  He obviously does support violence. He supports the murder, the killing of Jewish babies. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=641.76s)]
*  And for that, he ought to be held absolutely accountable and responsible. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=648.88s)]
*  It's a close case legally. It's not at all a close case morally. And yet too many people [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=653.04s)]
*  have not only supported his right to speak, but supported the despicable content of his speech. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=658.16s)]
*  So we ought to be treated the way we treat Nazis. We maybe give them the right to free speech, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  but we certainly despise them, hate them, don't wish them well, and don't express sympathy for [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=670.96s)]
*  them, their wives or their babies. This is not a man who deserves any sympathy. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=677.12s)]
*  You know there are Americans who believe in Nazi ideology and are free to express those views [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=681.36s)]
*  because they're protected by the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects hate speech. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=689.52s)]
*  Number two, by the way, you think Khalil supports the killing of Israeli babies. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=694.24s)]
*  So he just decided to do this disgusting straw man when in reality, Khalil was part of the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=701.92s)]
*  demonstrations because he kind of wanted to see an end to the slaughter of Palestinian babies, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=707.44s)]
*  which continues till this day. Because the lives of those Palestinian babies, that doesn't matter [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=713.36s)]
*  at all for Dershowitz. In fact, the lives of any babies, I would say, doesn't really matter much [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=718.4s)]
*  to Dershowitz, a lawyer for Jeffrey Epstein, an absolutely loathsome human being. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=722.72s)]
*  But unfortunately, he's not the only loathsome human being who's waiting on this issue. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=728.88s)]
*  You also have Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, who went even further and suggested that any [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=732.4s)]
*  protester should be imprisoned despite the Constitution explicitly granting Americans [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  that right. So Waz, you were so correct. Here's a little taste of what reinforces [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=744.0s)]
*  what you were saying earlier. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=751.76s)]
*  Well, the Democrats basically, they don't like our country anymore. They just want to [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=752.72s)]
*  tear it down. They're going to take this guy's side. Every Democrat that we work with up here, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=760.24s)]
*  they're going to take this guy's side and they're going to try to drive this narrative that he's [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=764.32s)]
*  doing the right thing. He's the people we should be backing. The heck with education. We have two [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=769.6s)]
*  levels of education. We have K through 12 and we have a higher ed. We've got to treat both of them [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=776.08s)]
*  different. But when it comes to protesters, we got to make sure we treat all of them the same. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=781.28s)]
*  Send them to jail. Free speech is great, but hateful hate free speech is not what we need [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=786.48s)]
*  in these universities and they don't need to be doing things that they're preaching from Hamas [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=792.8s)]
*  about anti-Cinemaism. Okay, so ironically in that- [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=798.0s)]
*  Centimism. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=803.28s)]
*  I know, no, no, I know, I know. I was going to say in that exact same segment, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=804.48s)]
*  he went on to talk about how education has been downgraded so much, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  which he himself just demonstrated for all of us to see. It's amazing to me. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=814.48s)]
*  So there you have it. Even Americans, you're engaging in any type of protest against the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=819.4399999999999s)]
*  great country of Israel. You should go to prison. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=827.6s)]
*  Go to prison. Yeah. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=828.4s)]
*  It's crazy. People are gonna look back at this time with awe to what, literally, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=830.24s)]
*  it really reminds me of the red scare, the McCarthyism, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=836.08s)]
*  that just straight up we see a commie under every single pillow. It's the same with this nonsense [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=841.28s)]
*  terrorism crap. Most people aren't buying this, Hamas is coming to kill us and blah, blah, blah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=847.76s)]
*  It's a joke and to be honest, the reason why the Israelis are losing the PR war here is this very [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=856.4s)]
*  thing that Dershowitz is talking about. Who's killed more babies? Who's killed more women? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=863.1999999999999s)]
*  Who's killed more people indiscriminately? Who's killed more civilians? It's tenfold [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=868.8s)]
*  the level of carnage that these folks have wrought. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=876.24s)]
*  And to hear Dershowitz be like, he thinks it's cool to kill babies, you can't be serious. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=879.12s)]
*  If that's a metric to make somebody a terrorist organization, then I mean, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=885.04s)]
*  damn, does the IDF have any peers? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=890.8s)]
*  What I wanna know is whether Dershowitz is joining the fight to get the Epstein files released. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=895.1999999999999s)]
*  Something tells me that won't be the case. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoIXmEd_Bo&t=900.0799999999999s)]
