"Former US President Barack Obama pushed hard to try to prevent Kamala Harris from being anointed the Democratic nominee in the 2024 race for president, a book has claimed. Obama reportedly advocated against Democrats nominating former Vice President in the wake of former President Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 presidential election. Obama instead pushed for an open primary, believing Harris was not the strongest candidate to win the election."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Obama Tried To Prevent Kamala's Candidacy, Book Claims
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA)
*  Yet another book has come out in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=0.0s)]
*  regard to the 2024 presidential [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=2.2600000000000002s)]
*  race and former President Barack [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=4.76s)]
*  Obama's role within it, especially [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=7.2s)]
*  on the Democratic side. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=9.82s)]
*  Now, according to fight inside [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=11.5s)]
*  the wildest battle for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=13.84s)]
*  the White House, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=15.42s)]
*  Obama really, really did not want [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=16.66s)]
*  Kamala Harris to be the Democratic [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=19.34s)]
*  nominee after former President Joe [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=21.92s)]
*  Biden dropped out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=24.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  He didn't think that she could win. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=26.24s)]
*  And we spoke to people very, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  very close to him who say this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  And there were major concerns. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=33.48s)]
*  So I think they were doing a quiet [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=35.36s)]
*  sort of lobbying effort to see what [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=37.72s)]
*  the mood was and whether there was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=40.16s)]
*  enough support for it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=42.64s)]
*  Certainly, I think Barack Obama was [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=44.36s)]
*  hearing from some donors. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=47.0s)]
*  I know Nancy Pelosi was too, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  that Kamala Harris couldn't win. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=51.14s)]
*  They kept doing this up in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=54.08s)]
*  until the final minutes of, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  right after Joe Biden endorsed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=57.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=59.84s)]
*  I think they were still calling [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=60.92s)]
*  around. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  It's why I think Barack Obama kept [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=62.96s)]
*  his powder dry for several days. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=64.88000000000001s)]
*  He wanted to see how all of this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  would play out, but he had major, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=68.48s)]
*  major concerns. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=70.36s)]
*  What were the nature of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=71.48s)]
*  the concerns? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=73.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=74.0s)]
*  I mean, the fact that she just [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  wouldn't be able to win. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  I think that they all saw her as [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=77.64s)]
*  a weaker vice president. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=79.84s)]
*  I don't think that they felt like [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=81.72s)]
*  Joe Biden had really championed her [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=84.12s)]
*  enough. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=86.92s)]
*  She was coming in kind of ill [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=87.52s)]
*  prepared to run as president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Certainly, they look back at her [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=92.0s)]
*  last campaign, I'm sure. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=94.48s)]
*  I mean, look, Obama was right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=96.28s)]
*  I mean, Obama wasn't wrong. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=100.24s)]
*  He was right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=101.6s)]
*  And look, the whole thing was [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=102.36s)]
*  a mess because you have [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=104.48s)]
*  the disastrous Joe Biden debate. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=106.0s)]
*  He waits a month before he finally [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  drops out and robs him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=111.68s)]
*  He drops Democratic voters from [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=113.64s)]
*  an opportunity of taking part in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  some sort of primary to pick [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=117.8s)]
*  a better candidate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=119.6s)]
*  And I'm sorry, it's now over. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=121.0s)]
*  So let me just be very clear. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=123.32s)]
*  She was a very bad candidate. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=125.88s)]
*  She wasn't funny. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=128.64s)]
*  She wasn't interesting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  I didn't buy into Brat summer, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=131.6s)]
*  whatever the F people were trying [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=133.28s)]
*  to sell us. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=135.0s)]
*  Lee Fong, a wonderful journalist, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=136.16s)]
*  just recently published an [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=138.2s)]
*  investigative report he did for [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=139.76s)]
*  real clear investigations. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=141.56s)]
*  And in it, he found that the entire [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=143.32s)]
*  like all the hype around Kamala was [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=146.32s)]
*  bought and paid for by [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=149.24s)]
*  Democratic billionaires. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=151.04s)]
*  Okay, all of these public figures [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  and influencers, they didn't give [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=156.16s)]
*  a damn about Kamala Harris. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=158.4s)]
*  Who knows if they actually voted [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=160.24s)]
*  for or even support her, but [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=161.8s)]
*  they were paid to go out there and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=163.24s)]
*  pretend like she was awesome, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=164.96s)]
*  like she's the best candidate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=166.56s)]
*  They tried to manufacture support [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=168.04s)]
*  for Kamala Harris. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=170.84s)]
*  And honestly, anyone paying [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  attention and anyone who knows how [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  politics works in America could see [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=176.0s)]
*  through it, I was able to see [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=177.76s)]
*  through it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=179.04s)]
*  But here's the other thing, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  you weren't even able to tell [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  the truth. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=182.72s)]
*  You weren't even able to do [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  accurate analysis of Kamala Harris [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  and how she was running [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=186.83999999999997s)]
*  this campaign. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=188.04s)]
*  Because if you did, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=189.0s)]
*  you're helping Trump when you need [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  to shut the F up and just pretend [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=192.0s)]
*  like she's a great, fabulous [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=193.72s)]
*  candidate who's definitely going to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=195.27999999999997s)]
*  win even though the aggregate of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=197.2s)]
*  polls consistently showed her [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  trailing Donald Trump. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=200.72s)]
*  Yeah, so there's another group to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  watch out for here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=203.76s)]
*  And that's those so-called [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=204.84s)]
*  influencers in MSNBC. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=206.16s)]
*  They're actually in the same [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  bucket. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=208.84s)]
*  Because look guys, we'll get back [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  to Obama and Biden because Obama [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  didn't want Biden to run either. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  And I thought that was obvious for [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=215.2s)]
*  reasons I'll explain. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=216.88s)]
*  But for Harris, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=217.92s)]
*  it was exceedingly obvious. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=218.88s)]
*  Because Biden drops out, and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=220.88s)]
*  at that point in the beginning, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=222.64s)]
*  all of them, Biden, Obama, and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  Pelosi, and Schumer, none of them [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=226.48s)]
*  endorsed Kamala Harris. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=228.68s)]
*  Normally the establishment [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=230.84s)]
*  anoints as they did with Biden in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=232.28s)]
*  2020. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  Remember Obama called everyone, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  got everybody, Buttigieg, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=236.12s)]
*  Klobuchar, etc. to drop out of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  the race in South Carolina so [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=238.88s)]
*  that Biden could get all the votes [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=240.36s)]
*  so that Bernie didn't win, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=241.96s)]
*  And so they all did exactly what [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=244.0s)]
*  Obama told them to do, and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=245.68s)]
*  he coordinated that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=247.08s)]
*  And that worked to make sure that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=248.4s)]
*  Bernie lost so that we couldn't [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=250.24s)]
*  have a populist option so [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=252.08s)]
*  Donald Trump could win. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=253.4s)]
*  Anyways, okay, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=255.0s)]
*  that's a different right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=255.76s)]
*  So now when Biden drops out, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=257.12s)]
*  no one endorses Harris. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=259.16s)]
*  That's obvious that they are not [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=261.24s)]
*  anointing, super obvious, because [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=263.32s)]
*  we've seen them anoint in 2020. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=265.56s)]
*  We've seen them anoint Hillary [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=267.64s)]
*  Clinton in 2016, and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=269.56s)]
*  they're a machine. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  They all get on board. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=272.04s)]
*  They all say that unity, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=273.48s)]
*  unity, unity, anyone who doesn't [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=275.04s)]
*  listen is a heretic and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=277.0s)]
*  should be driven from the party, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  etc. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=280.24s)]
*  In this case, the fact that, so [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=280.76s)]
*  Biden then screws them over half an [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=282.52s)]
*  hour later, he puts out a statement [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=284.32s)]
*  going, yeah, I think it should be [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=286.12s)]
*  Kamala. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=288.36s)]
*  Biden didn't want Kamala at all. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=288.88s)]
*  Biden thought Kamala was [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=291.8s)]
*  a disastrous candidate. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=292.92s)]
*  He did that to screw over [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=294.76s)]
*  the Democrats like Obama and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=296.04s)]
*  Pelosi would push them out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=297.52s)]
*  Because he's such an egomaniac. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=299.2s)]
*  He's a nasty, mean, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  terrible narcissist, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=303.48s)]
*  But the plan was none of us are [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=306.32s)]
*  going to endorse her because we [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  should have an open convention [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  because she's a disaster. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=310.56s)]
*  Obama and Pelosi stick with that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=311.96s)]
*  plan for an excruciating five days. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=313.88s)]
*  Because everybody's going, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  why isn't Obama endorsing her? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=317.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=319.36s)]
*  Why isn't Pelosi endorsing her? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=319.86s)]
*  Meanwhile, everyone is endorsing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=321.64000000000004s)]
*  within two days because of Biden, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=323.68s)]
*  she rounded up all the delegates. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  And even after she got all [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  the delegates, Obama and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  Pelosi hesitated before endorsing [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  her, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  It's crazy, yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=332.92s)]
*  But when you point that out, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=333.68s)]
*  what happens is, and this happened [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=335.48s)]
*  to us, and me in particular, all [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=337.8s)]
*  of the influencers online that are [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=340.04s)]
*  literally paid to kiss Democratic [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=342.32000000000005s)]
*  leadership ass, right? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=344.6s)]
*  But to be fair to them, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=346.52000000000004s)]
*  they genuinely believe it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=347.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, they think that the path [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  to victory is kiss ass harder, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=354.20000000000005s)]
*  And then they'll yell at anyone not [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=355.6s)]
*  kissing ass. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=357.48s)]
*  And they're like, how dare you, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  you're helping Trump. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=360.16s)]

*  you know how Democrats are like, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=362.36s)]
*  there's nothing we could do. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  There's nothing we, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=365.12s)]
*  their song is, you're helping [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump, you're helping Trump, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=367.36s)]
*  you're helping Trump, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=368.6s)]

*  Yeah, you're a right winger, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  you're helping Trump, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  you're voting for Trump. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=373.48s)]
*  No, I can see the Democrats for [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=375.2s)]
*  what they are, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=376.76s)]
*  what they're doing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=377.48s)]
*  And it doesn't matter, from day [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=378.84s)]
*  one, the minute Biden gets [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=380.16s)]
*  into office, if you criticize [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=381.24s)]
*  Biden at all, or any Democratic [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=382.4s)]
*  leader, you're helping Trump, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=383.88s)]
*  you're helping Trump, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=385.32s)]
*  you're helping Trump. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=386.28s)]
*  So that's their propaganda. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=387.28s)]
*  They don't even know it, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=388.8s)]
*  they're so in their own bubble. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=389.72s)]
*  And MSNBC, same thing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=391.4s)]
*  So when we were saying, look, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=393.24s)]
*  Obama's not endorsing, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=394.96s)]
*  Obama's not endorsing. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=396.6s)]

*  your beloved Obama, not my beloved, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=399.04s)]
*  your beloved Obama, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=400.88s)]

*  it to be Kamala Harris. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=404.35999999999996s)]
*  So you're lying, that's crazy, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=405.55999999999995s)]
*  there's no way. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=407.84s)]

*  you're trying to help Trump. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=411.0s)]
*  How did that help? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=413.03999999999996s)]

*  What did you do? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=414.44s)]
*  You knuckleheads, you actually [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  foiled your beloved Obama's plan, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  which was to do an open primary. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=420.0s)]
*  And your beloved Pelosi, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=423.2s)]
*  you ruined her plan. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=424.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=426.79999999999995s)]
*  Why did Obama, Biden, Pelosi, and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=427.32s)]
*  Schumer not want Kamala Harris? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=429.8s)]
*  Because they've been dealing with [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=432.8s)]
*  her all this time, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=434.48s)]
*  they know she wasn't going to win. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=435.48s)]
*  They know she's not up to the job. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=437.24s)]
*  But you wouldn't, but now turn [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=440.12s)]
*  around and criticize those leaders. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=441.92s)]
*  So your profile encouraged Barack [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=445.2s)]
*  Obama was to whisper behind [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=447.2s)]
*  the scenes. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=448.8s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=449.84s)]
*  Whisper, whisper, whisper. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=450.59999999999997s)]
*  Get a load of this, get a load of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=451.36s)]
*  this, okay? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=452.48s)]
*  According to the authors of that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=453.32s)]
*  book Fight, Amy Parnas and Allen, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry, Jonathan Allen. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=457.32s)]
*  Obama never thought Harris could [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=459.44s)]
*  beat Trump, but backed her when he [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=461.56s)]
*  saw he was under threat himself. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=463.76s)]
*  Suddenly in a position where his [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=466.76s)]
*  actions against Biden and Harris [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=468.92s)]
*  could diminish him in the eyes of [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=471.2s)]
*  democratic elites. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=473.48s)]
*  No, please, no, no diminishing for [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=475.08s)]
*  the grand legacy of benighted [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=478.84s)]
*  Barack Obama. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=481.72s)]
*  I mean, my God, what if his feelings [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=484.0s)]
*  were slightly heard up in Martha's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=486.04s)]
*  Vineyard? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=488.04s)]
*  Okay, so look, here's what a real [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=488.88s)]
*  leader would have done, okay? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=490.76s)]
*  Would have made his issues with [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=492.47999999999996s)]

*  time. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=500.11999999999995s)]
*  Instead, what did he do? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=500.61999999999995s)]
*  He sent David Axelrod to go speak [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  out against Obama. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=503.67999999999995s)]

*  Carvel and Axelrod are the two guys [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=512.0799999999999s)]

*  and strategist. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  The Clintons and the Obamas are [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=529.76s)]
*  telling you to push Biden out. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=531.32s)]
*  And every time I said, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=533.24s)]
*  that's not crazy, speculation, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=534.2s)]

*  Biden is young and dynamic. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=571.08s)]

*  the country into believing this [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=574.64s)]
*  nonsense that you believed. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=576.64s)]
*  Well, it didn't work. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=579.16s)]
*  So are you ever going to learn [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=580.64s)]
*  any lessons? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=582.0400000000001s)]
*  Obama, you're worried about your, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=583.32s)]
*  well, the never-gotten elites [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=585.32s)]
*  think of me. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=587.0s)]
*  So, and I interrupted when I said, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=588.6s)]
*  what would a real leader do? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=590.52s)]
*  He would have come out and said, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=592.36s)]
*  okay, a year earlier against Biden. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=594.2s)]
*  And he would have said, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=596.0s)]
*  as soon as Biden dropped out, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=596.84s)]
*  I think there should be [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=598.72s)]
*  an open convention. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=599.36s)]
*  Okay, if Obama had said that, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=601.28s)]
*  you know what we would have had? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=603.12s)]
*  An open convention. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=605.28s)]
*  And look, let's not forget the race [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=605.84s)]
*  dynamics that play a role in all of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=607.96s)]
*  this, right? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=610.08s)]
*  Because when there were some [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=611.24s)]
*  conversations happening prior to [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=613.08s)]
*  Biden dropping out, there was a lot [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=615.44s)]
*  of fear that if Kamala Harris [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=618.0s)]
*  wasn't his automatic replacement, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  well, black women wouldn't vote for [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  whoever the Democratic nominee is. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=625.08s)]
*  They'd feel slighted by [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=629.32s)]
*  But having someone like Obama come [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=631.64s)]
*  out immediately and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=633.8s)]
*  call for an open convention, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=634.7199999999999s)]
*  that would be different. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=636.0s)]
*  I think that that would maybe- [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=637.28s)]
*  No, that would have changed [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=638.56s)]
*  the whole dynamic. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=639.4s)]
*  Because they've spent their whole [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=640.04s)]
*  lives worshiping Obama and Pelosi. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=641.64s)]
*  That's exactly right, yes. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=643.2399999999999s)]
*  If Obama and Pelosi, a woman and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=644.3599999999999s)]
*  an African American, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=645.92s)]
*  the two leaders of the Democratic [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  Party came out and said, guys, we [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=648.56s)]
*  think we should have an open [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=650.12s)]
*  convention. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=651.4s)]
*  We love Kamala Harris, we think she [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=652.04s)]
*  might be able to win the open [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=653.4799999999999s)]
*  convention. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=654.5999999999999s)]
*  We have a lot of faith in her, but [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=655.2399999999999s)]
*  we need to pick the best possible [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=656.68s)]
*  candidate and we need to hear from [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=658.12s)]
*  the Democratic voters. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=659.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=661.28s)]
*  The voice of the voters is the most [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=661.8s)]
*  important thing. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=663.28s)]
*  Let's go to a convention and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  sort this thing out and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=665.24s)]
*  we're rooting for Kamala, right? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  What would have happened is we [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=667.92s)]
*  would have had an open convention [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=669.0s)]
*  because the DAC community, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  the Democratic Ask Kissing [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=671.64s)]
*  Community, okay? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=672.92s)]
*  They will do anything a Democratic [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=674.0799999999999s)]
*  leader tells them. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=676.16s)]
*  And Obama and Pelosi have more [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=677.88s)]
*  credibility than Biden who had just [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=679.4s)]
*  dropped out. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=681.0799999999999s)]
*  If they had told them open [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  convention, all of DAC would have [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=683.16s)]
*  turned around on a dime and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=684.64s)]
*  would have said open convention. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=685.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=687.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=688.24s)]
*  And hey, if you're in DAC, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=689.0799999999999s)]
*  remember, what would it [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=690.8399999999999s)]
*  open convention have done? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=692.36s)]
*  Why did I and Obama and Pelosi [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=694.16s)]
*  agree? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  Because we wanted to pick [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=698.6s)]
*  the best candidate so [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=700.16s)]
*  that we could beat Trump. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=701.4s)]
*  You could run and tell DAC. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=703.0s)]
*  Okay, and so it wasn't because [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=704.68s)]
*  Obama wanted to hurt the Democrats. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=706.52s)]
*  It wasn't because Pelosi wanted to [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=709.04s)]
*  hurt the Democrats and [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=710.8399999999999s)]
*  wanted Trump to win. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=712.12s)]
*  It's because they wanted to pick [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=713.72s)]
*  the best candidate. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=714.8399999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=715.48s)]
*  But the difference between me and [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=715.98s)]
*  if we're being honest, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=717.48s)]
*  Obama and Pelosi here is that they [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=718.56s)]
*  didn't have the courage to say it [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=720.24s)]
*  publicly. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=721.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=722.68s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=725.0799999999999s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=726.5999999999999s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMapLXXATA&t=728.1999999999999s)]
