TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Fellow Senator: 'Schumer's About As Popular As Chlamydia'
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk)
*  Many Democrats are angry at Schumer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=0.0s)]
*  Among them right now, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=3.2s)]
*  we've all seen the news, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=5.3s)]
*  he's about as popular as Chlamydia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  True, actually, and that might be [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=13.36s)]
*  one of the only times Senator John [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=15.58s)]
*  Kennedy is not wrong. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=17.8s)]
*  But I don't know, I think Chlamydia [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=20.68s)]
*  might be a little more popular. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=22.12s)]
*  What say you, Was? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=23.2s)]
*  Hey man, that ain't nothing but [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=25.16s)]
*  a couple of pills. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=26.68s)]
*  Schumer's less popular, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=27.8s)]
*  I'm telling you, that ain't nothing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=29.32s)]
*  but some penicillin, yo. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=31.84s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  My God. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=34.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=35.4s)]
*  So look, we keep finding more [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=36.36s)]
*  reasons for why Chuck Schumer is so [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=41.04s)]
*  unpopular even among the Democratic [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=45.24s)]
*  base, especially among the Democratic [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=49.04s)]
*  base in recent weeks. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=51.44s)]
*  Now first it was of course voting [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=52.92s)]
*  along with Republicans to pass [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=54.8s)]
*  their continuing resolution to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  the government funded through [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=58.4s)]
*  September. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  In that bill was a provision that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  allows for Donald Trump to move [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=63.44s)]
*  money around as he wishes, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=65.92s)]
*  as he pleases without any worry of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=68.28s)]
*  congressional or judicial pushback [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=71.28s)]
*  or intervention. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=74.68s)]
*  And now we're also finding out [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=76.44s)]
*  that he was so delusional about [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=78.6s)]
*  the state of the Republican party [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  during the Biden administration [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=83.16s)]
*  that he thought, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=85.68s)]
*  the Republicans will save us. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=87.92s)]
*  So the New York Times has these [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  reporters who published a book. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=93.52s)]
*  It's Annie Carney and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  Luke Broadwater, they're about to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  release their new book. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=99.88s)]
*  It's called Madhouse, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=101.52s)]
*  How Donald Trump, MAGA, Mean Girls, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=102.96s)]
*  a Former Used Car Salesman, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=105.32s)]
*  Jesus Christ, is a long title. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=107.32s)]
*  A Florida Nepo Baby and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=110.0s)]
*  a Man with Rats in His Walls [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=111.34s)]
*  Broke Congress. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  So in that book, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  they say that Schumer told them in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=115.76s)]
*  June of 2023, here's my hope after [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  this election, when the Republican [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=120.72s)]
*  party expels the turd of Donald [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump, it will go back to being [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  the old Republican party. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=127.68s)]
*  Oops, now they also write that, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=129.52s)]
*  despite all facts to the contrary, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=132.16s)]
*  it was a core belief of Schumer's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=135.04s)]
*  that politics in America would [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=137.52s)]
*  recalibrate after Trump [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=139.76s)]
*  exited the stage. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  Driving through Brooklyn months [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=142.88s)]
*  of a shattering election cycle, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=145.08s)]
*  Schumer repeated the sentiment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=147.52s)]
*  Schumer thought 25 Republican [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=149.8s)]
*  senators were scared of Trump, but [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  those people, if Trump is gone, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=154.36s)]
*  will go back. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=156.66000000000003s)]
*  Now to add insult to injury, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=157.52s)]
*  Schumer apparently also questioned, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  God, the struggles of American [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=162.0s)]
*  workers because he is so out of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=164.0s)]
*  touch that he has no idea what [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  ordinary Americans are dealing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  with. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=169.84s)]
*  Schumer also mused on voters who [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=170.36s)]
*  back Trump wondering why a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=172.56s)]
*  notional New York City firefighter [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=174.52s)]
*  would be so effing angry when he [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=177.28s)]
*  had such a comfortable life. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  I hate these people, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  I hate Schumer, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=183.72s)]
*  I hate Democratic leadership. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=184.8s)]
*  They're so bad, they are so bad. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  Do you even know what life is like [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=189.96s)]
*  for most Americans? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=192.96s)]
*  He has no idea, he's too busy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  What does this talk [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  portray? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=198.28s)]

*  look like, I'm curious. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  How wealthy is he? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  When was the last time he spoke to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=208.8s)]
*  a constituent? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=210.68s)]
*  This guy has been failing for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  decades and it's gone unchecked. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=214.28s)]
*  And now guys, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=218.52s)]
*  chickens have come home to roost. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=219.12s)]
*  I'm glad that Democratic voters [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=220.44s)]
*  have finally woken up to this, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  finally. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Instead of attacking the people [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=224.68s)]
*  who have been trying to raise [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  awareness about these feckless [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=228.22s)]
*  pathetic losers, finally, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  Democratic voters are focusing on [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=231.66000000000003s)]
*  the pathetic losers who have wronged [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=233.92s)]
*  them time and time again. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=236.24s)]
*  Carney and Broadwater also quote [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=238.0s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=239.84s)]
*  Murphy was writing to entertain [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=242.24s)]
*  the Schumer theory of the case [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=244.72s)]
*  about a Republican party that could [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=247.12s)]
*  be rescued from Trumpism, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=249.88s)]
*  the author's right, but [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=251.92s)]
*  he didn't buy it himself. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=253.88s)]
*  Okay, well, at least he's not [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=256.56s)]
*  completely delusional. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=257.8s)]
*  So, we're not going to win with [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=258.52s)]
*  these people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=260.72s)]
*  They're not an opposition party. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=261.76s)]
*  Okay, I wouldn't be surprised if [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  they secretly love everything [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=266.76s)]
*  Trump's doing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=268.2s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out what was [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=269.0s)]
*  so great about Schumer was in [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=271.8s)]
*  Congress and he was in a leadership [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=274.2s)]
*  position. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  He was basically right under Harry [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=278.44s)]
*  Reid who rest in peace. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  My God, do we miss Harry Reid every [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=283.0s)]
*  freaking day. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=285.44s)]
*  What was so wonderful about [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=286.84s)]
*  the Republican Congress when Obama [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  was the president? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=290.88s)]
*  What was so good about that? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=292.2s)]
*  Why do you want to go back to that? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=293.8s)]
*  Because he probably agrees with [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=295.68s)]
*  them, agreed with them. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=296.88s)]
*  What was so great about working [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=297.56s)]
*  with these people, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=299.12s)]
*  they obstructed your agenda at [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=300.32s)]
*  every turn. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  Do you remember death panels? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=303.24s)]
*  That was them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=305.84s)]
*  That was them. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=307.48s)]
*  When we just wanted to do the ACA, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=308.6s)]
*  which by the way, they had to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=310.36s)]
*  change from Obamacare to the ACA. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=311.96s)]
*  Because even nominal improvements [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=314.32s)]
*  to the status quo of healthcare [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=316.6s)]
*  became so widely populated. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=318.88s)]
*  It was like, all right, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=320.56s)]
*  let's stop affiliating Obama with [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=321.84s)]
*  this freaking ACA thing because [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=323.8s)]
*  people actually like it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=325.6s)]
*  What was so great about that? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=327.04s)]
*  That's what's so [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=329.0s)]
*  stupid about what Schumer said. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=329.84s)]
*  There was nothing good about [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=331.8s)]
*  the Republicans before Trump came [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=333.68s)]
*  along on the escalator before that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=335.92s)]
*  And the idea that they're going to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=338.52s)]
*  go against Trump when he is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=340.64s)]
*  the singular only popular thing in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=342.36s)]
*  the Republican Party. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  There is no other popular [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=346.92s)]
*  constituency, okay? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=348.96s)]
*  There's no other factions that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=351.2s)]
*  have a base support. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=353.52s)]
*  There's no like, I don't know, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  Bernie to Trump's Biden. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=357.12s)]
*  It's just Trump. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=359.0s)]
*  So the idea that they would run [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=360.84s)]
*  against the tide of the entire [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=362.52s)]
*  party, their entire voting base, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=364.32s)]
*  just seems so insane to me, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=366.64s)]
*  I'm sure there's still a couple of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=369.4s)]
*  true blue Christian conservatives [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=371.56s)]
*  who are like, you know what? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  I never really liked Trump. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=375.56s)]
*  I held my nose to get down with [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=376.64s)]
*  him. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  I want to get back to my God [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=379.16s)]
*  bothering and doing the Trump [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=380.6s)]
*  thing makes me look like a complete [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  utter full of absolute crap [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  hypocrite. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  And I'd like to get back to not [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=388.24s)]
*  being that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  But other than that, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=390.68s)]
*  there's no constituency for [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  the type of Republicans that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  Chuck Schumer is having wet dreams [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  about, it's absurd. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=397.48s)]
*  I've been thinking about something [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  a lot lately. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  So now that the Trump Pentagon is [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=402.76000000000005s)]
*  even considering Biden's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=405.24s)]
*  considering nuclear war with Iran. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=407.84s)]
*  I wonder if the Bill Kristol's and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=410.88s)]
*  the Liz Cheney's are like, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=413.28s)]
*  you know. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=415.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=415.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they're back on board. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=417.96s)]
*  They're back on board. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=419.76s)]
*  Creaming their pants over it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely loving it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=422.23999999999995s)]
*  What with Iran, that is the, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=423.32s)]
*  dude, these two people were talking [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  about opening up a third front [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=428.55999999999995s)]
*  against Iran when they were getting [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=430.96s)]
*  smoked in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=433.76s)]
*  That's how insane the neocons are, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=436.36s)]
*  they're hard on is for Iran. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=439.12s)]
*  So yeah, nobody should be surprised [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=441.44s)]
*  if all of these quote unquote, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=443.48s)]
*  remember Never Trumpers? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=445.2s)]
*  Remember that faction of alleged [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=446.64s)]
*  Republicans that existed and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=448.88s)]
*  they would get all the oxygen on [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=450.8s)]
*  cable news and New York Times. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=452.8s)]
*  And we love Bush's former speech [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  writers, the guys that wrote [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  the speeches that condone stuff [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=458.88s)]
*  like torture and lying us into Iraq. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=460.8s)]

*  arms. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=465.2s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=466.88000000000005s)]
*  They don't have a constituency [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=467.68s)]
*  either. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  Nobody ever cared about these dudes [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=470.04s)]
*  or girls. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=472.16s)]
*  Which is why it was so smart that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=473.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris campaigned with them. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=475.16s)]

*  Anyway, and yet another example of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=477.92s)]
*  how useless Democratic leadership [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=480.76000000000005s)]
*  is. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=483.56s)]
*  New reporting reveals that Hakeem [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=484.16s)]

*  lovingly likes to say, and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=489.76000000000005s)]
*  Chuck Schumer are raising even more [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=492.20000000000005s)]
*  money from Trump and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=495.36s)]

*  Invariant? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=528.92s)]
*  Let's not be unfair. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=529.8s)]

*  in those short months, they've [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=560.0s)]
*  raised quite a bit of money for [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=562.28s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  And look, this is important was [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=565.9599999999999s)]
*  because what led to so much failure [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  for the Democrats in that past [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=570.56s)]
*  election cycle was that they just [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=572.56s)]
*  didn't have enough money. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  If Kamala Harris had enough money, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=577.0s)]
*  she would have won the presidential [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=579.36s)]
*  election, duh, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  it always comes down to money, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=582.88s)]
*  nothing else matters, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=584.8399999999999s)]
*  So I'm excited for their hall and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=587.12s)]
*  they should keep focusing on what's [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=589.12s)]
*  super important to them, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  raising more corporate cash and [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=593.0s)]
*  failing to connect with American [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  voters so much so that they lose [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=597.16s)]
*  elections, empower the Republican [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=599.12s)]
*  Party and make everyone furious. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=601.52s)]
*  So, great. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=603.88s)]
*  Two things in case viewers didn't [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=605.7199999999999s)]
*  pick up on the sarcasm that Anna [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=608.0s)]
*  was getting at there. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=610.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris raised like a billion [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=613.12s)]
*  and a half dollars, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=615.12s)]
*  money was not the problem. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=616.16s)]
*  She got plenty of money. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=617.52s)]
*  Don't think for a second this was [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=618.6s)]
*  some grassroots bunch of people [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=619.92s)]
*  sending $40. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=621.36s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=621.96s)]
*  She got big money involved in her [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=623.28s)]
*  campaign, still got her ass [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=625.32s)]
*  whooped all up and down the floor. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=627.16s)]
*  She got cooked, okay? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=629.64s)]
*  Okay, so that's one thing to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=631.84s)]
*  understand too. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=633.92s)]
*  What the people in the tech sector, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=635.48s)]
*  big tech people and medium tech [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=637.8s)]
*  people sort of intuited quite [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=639.76s)]
*  correctly is that going against [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=641.96s)]
*  the Democrats would have no [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  consequences. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=646.6s)]
*  Whereas Trump made it known like [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=647.84s)]
*  you guys don't support me, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=650.2s)]
*  I'm going to make you pay when I [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=652.2s)]
*  win. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=654.48s)]
*  I'm going to crush you guys when I [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=655.0s)]
*  win. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=657.28s)]
*  I'm going to sick the DOJ, the FCC, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=657.84s)]
*  the SEC on all of you people when I [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=660.6s)]
*  win. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=663.24s)]
*  So you better get in line and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=663.84s)]
*  they know that they put their lot [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=665.92s)]
*  in with Trump. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=668.7199999999999s)]
*  And now the Democrats are courting [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=670.7199999999999s)]
*  these same people. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=673.28s)]
*  Peter Thiel has campaigned for [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=674.92s)]
*  Trump. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=676.8399999999999s)]
*  He's got a podcast where he's [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=677.5999999999999s)]
*  constantly talking about why Trump [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=679.0799999999999s)]
*  is better, why the Republicans are [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=680.88s)]
*  the party that they want to [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=682.5999999999999s)]
*  support. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=683.8399999999999s)]
*  And now, instead of the Democrats [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=684.56s)]
*  being like, guess what? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=686.52s)]
*  You guys put your lot in with [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=688.2399999999999s)]
*  a loser, he's going to be [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=689.4s)]
*  an utter disaster. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=690.4799999999999s)]
*  We're going to be back in power. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=691.5999999999999s)]
*  We're going to make you feel [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=693.04s)]
*  the pain instead of doing that, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=694.64s)]
*  instead of score settling, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=696.5999999999999s)]
*  with their political enemies, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=698.52s)]
*  which Trump telegraphs all the time [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=700.52s)]
*  and look at the freaking results. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=702.64s)]
*  All of these people at his [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=704.88s)]
*  inauguration sucking up and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=706.1999999999999s)]
*  kissing the ring, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=707.8s)]
*  the Democrats go and do the opposite. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=708.8s)]
*  Instead of sending a message like, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=710.92s)]
*  yo, you guys have to pay a price for [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=712.92s)]
*  going with Trump and this disaster [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  that he's going to run, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=717.0799999999999s)]
*  that's going to have us just riding [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=718.48s)]
*  back into power. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=720.48s)]
*  No, Hawk Jeffries and Schumer are [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  like, please, please, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=724.0799999999999s)]

*  I want some money, Zaddy. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=730.0s)]
*  That's what they're doing instead. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=731.4000000000001s)]
*  They're going back to their [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=733.08s)]
*  corporate Zaddy's and begging for [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=735.1600000000001s)]
*  money, like some little hoes. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  Like some little hoes, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=740.2s)]
*  you're right, you're right. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=741.24s)]
*  In fact, I'm not calling her a ho, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=742.6s)]
*  but here's the CEO of Invariant, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=744.88s)]
*  which is the lobby. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=747.44s)]
*  We don't know that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=749.0400000000001s)]
*  We don't know that. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=750.84s)]
*  I can't confirm or deny any ho [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  action taking place with this [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=754.0s)]
*  individual. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=756.12s)]
*  However, she is the CEO of [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=757.4s)]
*  Invariant, Heather Podesta is her [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=759.2s)]
*  name and there's Chuck Schumer [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=761.72s)]
*  standing next to her during this [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=764.08s)]
*  fundraising effort. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=766.4s)]
*  Because again, these people are [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=768.76s)]
*  funded by the same donors, same [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=771.48s)]
*  corporate donors as Republicans are. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=774.28s)]
*  So if you're wondering why [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=778.04s)]
*  Democrats aren't fighting back, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=779.4s)]
*  they might be paid to behave the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=781.12s)]
*  way they're behaving. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=782.76s)]
*  Maybe consider that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=784.72s)]
*  Maybe consider why they've gotten [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  deeper and deeper into maximalist [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=787.9599999999999s)]
*  culture war nonsense instead of [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=789.76s)]
*  focusing on working class issues. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=791.36s)]
*  It's the only way they can [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  differentiate themselves from [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=794.8399999999999s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=796.4399999999999s)]
*  And they've become so maximalist [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=797.24s)]
*  on some of those issues that it [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=799.16s)]
*  turned voters off. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=800.8399999999999s)]
*  So you don't do anything for [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=802.1999999999999s)]
*  the working class, then you push [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=803.76s)]
*  super far unhinged culture war [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=805.76s)]
*  stuff onto everybody that they [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=807.5999999999999s)]
*  don't like and they reject. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=809.52s)]
*  What do you think is going to [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=812.48s)]
*  happen? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=813.5999999999999s)]
*  So maybe a little less scolding and [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=814.84s)]
*  a little more doing to improve [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=817.0s)]
*  people's material condition. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=818.92s)]
*  That's how you win elections. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=821.24s)]
*  More money isn't going to save [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=822.6s)]
*  them, but they apparently haven't [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=823.8s)]
*  gotten that message yet. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=825.24s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=826.48s)]
*  an angel gets a swings. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLriemTaenk&t=828.0s)]
