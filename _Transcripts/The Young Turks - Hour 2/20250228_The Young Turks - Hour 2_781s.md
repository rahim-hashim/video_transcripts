# INSIDER: We Lied About Biden's Mental Fitness From Day One
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM)
*  On Wednesday, I was holding a seminar with a former Biden White House official, Michael [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=0.0s)]
*  LaRosa. Well, he admitted something that I had never heard someone from the Biden administration [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=4.72s)]
*  say out loud. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=9.44s)]
*  Cover up to me is a little hard, a little harsh. We were always from day one cognizant [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=10.96s)]
*  that age was an issue. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=20.82s)]
*  Well, there are some things that are true. I mean, like the gaslighting, there was a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=23.2s)]
*  lot of denial of the polling. And I will use the term gaslight, because that's what they [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=27.6s)]
*  were doing, the campaign, former colleagues. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  That was Jill Biden's ex-press secretary and White House insider Michael LaRosa admitting [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=40.24s)]
*  that the Biden campaign was gaslighting the public with its constant denials that Joe [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=46.8s)]
*  Biden's mental abilities were declining. Now, Cenk, this may come as a surprise to you, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  are you shocked to learn that Biden wasn't in fact, young and dynamic and sharp behind the scenes? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Oh my God, really? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, first time for someone in it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=66.4s)]
*  Guys, the important part of this story is we'll show you some of the tape here, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  is that they're finally admitting it. And so I mean, I don't know anyone who is more gaslit [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=72.4s)]
*  on that issue than I was. Because I was like, he's old, he's not going to win. Like, you're crazy, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=78.16s)]
*  you're totally nuts, right? So I'll get to that reaction in a second as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=84.24s)]
*  And to me, guys, and we'll talk about this too, will the Democratic voters ever learn a lesson? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  So please, everybody, listen to what he's saying about how they lied to you, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=97.52s)]
*  and they knew they were lying to you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=101.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, at the seminar, which was hosted by Puck journalist Tara Palmieri, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=102.72s)]
*  LaRosa also admitted that Biden's team was terrified of letting him do [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  media appearances. Take a look. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=112.32s)]
*  The president's team was scared to death of a promptive, unscripted, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=114.0s)]
*  unraised, unpracticed, un-choreographed, anything. They couldn't compete for the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=123.28s)]
*  detention economy. They just couldn't do it. They didn't have any idea. And they didn't have the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=128.48s)]
*  vessel. Either Biden, by the way, would have done anything. He loves, he loves doing stuff. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=133.76s)]
*  It was the orbit that did not trust their candidate. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  But despite not trusting Biden and their own candidates to be able to speak to the media, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  LaRosa also revealed that from day one, there was no question [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=153.92s)]
*  that Joe Biden would run again. Take a look. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=158.0s)]
*  What are you concerned about him running for re-election in 2020? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=160.48s)]
*  Yes, and I'll say this. When I got to the White House on day one, it became pretty clear to me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=163.68s)]
*  I think I went in, first of all, I was just happy to be there, excited. I used to drive my boss home [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=172.4s)]
*  every night, my chief of staff, because we lived in the same building. And I remember him saying [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=177.28s)]
*  something about, well, that's after the re-elect. That's a second term thing. I said, wait, what? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  I think- You believe the bridge. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=191.12s)]
*  I think, well, it wasn't that I believed the bridge. It was just that I just assumed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=192.32s)]
*  that this was gonna be like, okay, we're gonna pass the torch to another [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=197.28s)]
*  generation of Democrats and let them handle a Trump 2.0 campaign. But I was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=200.64s)]
*  brought to reality pretty fast. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=210.88s)]
*  But why not? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=212.64s)]
*  Why wouldn't he run? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=213.44s)]
*  Yeah, why not? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=214.24s)]
*  It was, why wouldn't he? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  Now on top of just insisting Biden was the only candidate who can beat Trump and he was the best [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=216.56s)]
*  person to run, he also admitted they just totally denied polling. Take a look. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=222.72s)]
*  The message to everybody was to make sure that you tell people, it's too early, it's too early. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=228.88s)]
*  These polls don't mean anything. Well, it became too early and these polls don't mean anything for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=234.32s)]
*  about a year and a half. The polls, the numbers never moved. By denying the data that was out [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=238.08s)]
*  there publicly, by denying the really insightful journalism that they were actually demeaning [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=244.88s)]
*  a lot of the people. But it was the data denial that really bothered me because we loved polling [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  when we were running. Because we were always ahead. All of a sudden, because they're always behind, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=258.8s)]
*  the polls are meaningless and they were attacking the New York Times. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=265.04s)]
*  They did do a lot of gaslighting of people and I think if you were watching MSNBC, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=270.4s)]
*  you probably believed them and were probably pretty shocked. But if you were [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=276.4s)]
*  consuming information, consuming data and looking at it objectively and trying to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=283.28s)]
*  interpret it and process it objectively, then none of it was surprising. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is ridiculous. None of it's surprising. But Cenk, what do you make of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  more and more Biden staffers and White House staffers coming out and be like, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  well, actually, yeah, he wasn't all there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I'm furious. I'm not at all surprised. And anybody who watched the Young Turks regularly, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=306.88s)]
*  everything he just said is what we told you ahead of time. And when we said it, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  what happened? Mainstream media was like, how dare you? And let's be honest, a lot of Democratic [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=320.08s)]
*  voters were like, you're hurting the cause. We think you're trying to help Trump. And I [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=326.24s)]
*  kept saying a thousand times over, guys, anyone who knows politics knows they're gonna lose. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=331.52s)]
*  Backing Biden is helping Trump because it's a guaranteed loss. And now they're saying, yeah, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=337.44s)]
*  we knew he was gonna lose. We knew he was a mess. We knew we couldn't do a single interview. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=343.52s)]
*  We all knew, but me, me, me, me, me. But back then, when we were saying it, we were the enemy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=348.56s)]
*  No, the truth is never the enemy. So just stop demanding that your media sources lie to you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=355.04s)]
*  It doesn't help. It hurts. You have to be honest with yourself before you can move forward. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=363.2s)]
*  We could have had a great candidate. We could have beaten Donald Trump. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  And instead, we went with this adult fool and his sickeningly corrupt inner team. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=373.44000000000005s)]
*  Never trust a Democratic leader. These guys, these establishment guys, I'm not saying never [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=380.0s)]
*  trust a Democratic politician, although beware of 90% of them, okay? But in terms of leadership, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=384.48s)]
*  the ones who say no, donor money, donor money, donor money. They're the ones that have corrupted [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=390.72s)]
*  this party and ruined this party. Look at all the admissions. I'll go as quickly as I can. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  They just, you saw him say all of these things. They were scared of having Biden do interviews. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=399.76s)]
*  Remember when I said he's not doing the Super Bowl interview? The Super Bowl interview is the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=404.88s)]
*  layup. That's a softball and the biggest audience. And that's when so many people who are savvy about [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=409.04s)]
*  politics switched over. Axelrod, Carville, Ezra Klein, Nate Silva. They're like, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=414.96s)]
*  they're not doing the Super Bowl interview. That means they're surrendering. They're not even going [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=420.24s)]
*  to try to win this. Second admission, we knew we were getting killed in the attention economy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=424.72s)]
*  So they know they had to do the interviews, but they couldn't put Joe Biden out there. Why? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=430.32000000000005s)]
*  Because they knew that he had dementia. They knew that his brain was not functioning. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=435.12s)]
*  But they're like, it doesn't matter. Our jobs are on the line. Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm gonna get paid. I'm gonna be the star who got this adult old fool elected. And then as soon as [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=444.32000000000005s)]
*  he's elected, we'll do 25th Amendment and put in the next corporate robot. It doesn't matter. Me, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  me, me, me, me. They didn't just betray the country. They betrayed you, the Democratic voters. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=453.52s)]
*  They betrayed you more than anyone else has ever betrayed you. They knew they were gonna lose. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=459.28s)]
*  So then he says, well, his advisor, Biden wanted to go on because he's senile. He doesn't know what [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=465.68s)]
*  he's doing. But his advisors wouldn't let him go on. Why wouldn't they let him go on? Because they [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=472.64s)]
*  know with great certainty that he's senile. And every single time, not only they lie when they go [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=478.0s)]
*  on air, no, he's young and dynamic. You should see him behind the scenes. Meanwhile, they go [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=483.28s)]
*  off camera and they're like, don't let him on the scenes. He's even worse behind the scenes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=487.76s)]
*  We just all lie to everyone. They're the most grotesque liars. Okay, he says always [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  lying about passing the torch. We said we're gonna pass the torch. No way. Joe Biden's a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=500.0s)]
*  giant ego maniac. Everyone who works around him wants to keep working at the White House, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  wants to keep getting paid, wants to keep having power. So they were never gonna pass the torch. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=508.88s)]
*  They were lying from day one. And then I don't want you to miss something he said that seemed [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=513.2s)]
*  small but is big. He said, my boss told me that's a second term issue. That's a second term issue. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=519.12s)]
*  Now they told you they were gonna pass all their priorities. And then Joe Biden cared so much about [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=525.2800000000001s)]
*  those policies. Meanwhile, internally, they're going, we're not gonna do any of those things. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=530.4000000000001s)]
*  If we get a second term with the guy we all know as senile, then we might do them in the second [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  term. But we're lying to our voters. We never intended to do any of these policies, told you. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=540.24s)]
*  Then the polls, I said over and over again, guys, look at the polls. Yeah, they might be [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=546.0s)]
*  off by one or two, max four points. But he's in the 30s. No one in the 30s has ever won [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=550.96s)]
*  as an incumbent, ever. And they knew that. And they're like, no, it doesn't matter. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=556.64s)]
*  Okay, when we're up, the polls are great. When we're down, who cares about the polls? Me, me, me, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=561.36s)]
*  I gotta keep my job in power. And then finally, he just told you himself, MSNBC. If you listen to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  that garbage, that dumpster fire, they're lying to you on purpose. That's how we lied to you. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=571.2s)]
*  He just told you. We have our liars go out and say it on MSNBC. And MSNBC hosts are like, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=577.6s)]
*  of course, that's right. Joe Biden is great and young and dynamic. He's just the greatest. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  Now everybody, we're friends with Joe Biden. We're friends with Joe Biden. We have breakfast with [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden. Joe Biden's the best. You lost, you lost the country. They're doing Project 2025. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=591.76s)]
*  I told you it was an existential threat to democracy and to the country. Who cares? Me, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=598.08s)]
*  me, me, me, me, me, me, me. I'm friends with Joe Biden, MSNBC. We F Democrats for a living. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=602.64s)]
*  That should be their new slogan. Yeah, it's so true. I mean, I remember back then, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=608.88s)]
*  we were talking about this on the Young Turks in 2019 and even late 2018, that Biden struggled, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=615.36s)]
*  even at that time, to coherently and charismatically message almost anything. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=623.52s)]
*  He was simply seen as a relief from Trump's horrendous assault upon us all during the COVID [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=628.8s)]
*  pandemic, right? But we did have a candidate then, not to cry too much about it, who was charismatic, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=635.36s)]
*  who has and continues to have the utmost integrity. No one's perfect and is so much integrity that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=642.08s)]
*  he's grumpy about it. And that was Senator Sanders. And I'm biased because I got to be part of that [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=649.76s)]
*  campaign, but that guy kept it real. And we need someone who keeps it real right now, keeping it [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=654.48s)]
*  real, right? Because this is it. The data shows it very clear and we saw this with the aftermath [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=658.96s)]
*  of this election. People don't watch MSNBC and CNN. There's a fragmentation of media that's [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  occurred as a function of the digital world, the internet and so on, where we go on various [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=670.56s)]
*  podcasts and so on. And on these podcasts, and particularly real content, you have to get [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=675.3599999999999s)]
*  people's attention. There's no one worse at getting or keeping your attention than our former [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=680.4799999999999s)]
*  president. So I mean, this is what has occurred. But on top of it, I think the most insulting part [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=686.64s)]
*  of it is the talking down at all of us and insulting all of our intelligence. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=693.68s)]
*  And that's why people are like, look, nothing's fundamentally changed. He said nothing's gonna [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=698.32s)]
*  fundamentally change. At least this kind of horrible now current president and Trump [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=701.76s)]
*  acknowledges grievances and says he'll blow it all up. But it was a giant plate of nothing [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=708.72s)]
*  when it came to Biden. And per our earlier comments, he could have done a much better job [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=714.8s)]
*  of messaging if he was even capable of charisma or his surrogates could have been [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=719.76s)]
*  in an attention economy around some of the good things that were actually accomplished, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=724.64s)]
*  which were a few on the domestic policy level with the last administration and he didn't do it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=728.8000000000001s)]
*  Super last thing, Jay Tamper and Alex Thompson from Axios Orodi writing a book about [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=733.2s)]
*  who was responsible for the cover up of Biden's mental decline. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=739.2s)]
*  Mainstream media writing a book about that is like OJ Simpson writing a book about how he's [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=743.5200000000001s)]
*  gonna find the real killer. Okay, it was mainstream media that covered it up. Stop listening to [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=748.24s)]
*  liars. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwvP8ghqcM&t=753.92s)]
