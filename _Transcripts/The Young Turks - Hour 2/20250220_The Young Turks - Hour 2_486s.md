"Fox News host Jesse Watters suggested Wednesday that impending layoffs at the Pentagon may be too drastic, arguing that ‚Äúveterans should get priority‚Äù when it comes to exemptions.

On The Five, Watters said he was recently contacted by a 20-year veteran named Chris who now works for the Pentagon, but has only been there ‚Äúa few months‚Äù and is in a probationary period..‚Äù

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Jesse Watters Turns on Elon Musk's DOGE???
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc)
*  We just need to be a little bit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=0.0s)]
*  less callous with the way, Harold. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=1.96s)]
*  We talk about dozing people, okay? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=4.42s)]
*  I just want that to sink in. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=6.82s)]
*  You're arguing with yourself. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=8.46s)]
*  I am not guilty of that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=9.46s)]
*  You're arguing with yourself. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=11.46s)]
*  I finally found one person I knew [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=14.14s)]
*  that got dozed and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  it hit me in the heart. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=16.38s)]
*  It looks like someone from Jesse [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=19.66s)]
*  Waters' personal life is impacted [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  by the mass firings of federal [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=24.42s)]
*  employees and all of a sudden, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=26.62s)]
*  He wants a little bit more of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=29.36s)]
*  a surgical approach in determining [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=31.34s)]
*  who should be let go. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=33.9s)]
*  So let's hear a little more of what [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=36.199999999999996s)]
*  Waters has to say and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=37.9s)]
*  then we'll share our thoughts. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=39.0s)]
*  Let me tell you a story about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=41.72s)]
*  Chris. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=42.5s)]
*  Chris was a guy I met at a shooting [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  event in New Jersey last year. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=45.2s)]
*  Is Chris in the interview? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=47.04s)]
*  This is another guy, this is Chris. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  He was a 20 year veteran of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=49.4s)]
*  the US military. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  He was one of these guys in one of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=52.2s)]
*  these elite units, killed a lot of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=53.8s)]
*  bad guys, put his life on the line. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  And now he punched out after 20 [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=58.099999999999994s)]
*  years and working for the Pentagon. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=60.62s)]
*  And he's only been there a few [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=64.3s)]
*  months, so he's probationary. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=66.06s)]
*  And he just found out he's probably [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=68.7s)]
*  going to get laid off. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=69.97999999999999s)]
*  He's going to get dozed. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=71.02s)]
*  And he texted me and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=72.62s)]
*  he said, Jesse, this isn't good. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=73.62s)]
*  I'm upset, this is really sad. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=75.42s)]
*  And this guy's not a DEI consultant. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  This guy's not a climate consultant. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=80.66s)]
*  This guy is a veteran. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=83.66s)]
*  So when you're talking about dozing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=86.0s)]
*  people, veterans should get [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=88.2s)]
*  priority. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=89.96s)]
*  Well, I think it's important to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=93.88s)]
*  know that according to Ryan Grimm, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=96.08s)]
*  about 30% of federal employees are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=98.72s)]
*  veterans. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=101.24s)]
*  Yeah, no, the thing that I love [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  about this is, this is a classic [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=106.72s)]
*  Republican reaction. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=109.0s)]
*  Let's go get the sons of bitches. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  You cut something for me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=113.08s)]
*  It affected me? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=114.33999999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, well, of course you [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=116.1s)]
*  shouldn't cut things that affect [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=117.94s)]
*  me, no way. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=119.94s)]
*  This reminds me of one of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=121.13999999999999s)]
*  the Republican senators said, well, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=122.74s)]
*  I was against gay marriage, but [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=125.3s)]
*  then I found out my son is gay, so [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=127.33999999999999s)]
*  now I'm for it because it affected [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=129.32s)]
*  me. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=131.38s)]
*  Like, well, okay, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=131.98s)]
*  thank you for telling on yourself. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=133.22s)]
*  But that is a thing that happens all [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=135.1s)]
*  the time with Republicans. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=136.98s)]
*  With everybody. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=138.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to keep it real, okay? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=140.1s)]
*  I know people are going to get mad [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=141.54s)]
*  that I'm giving Jesse Waters a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=143.34s)]
*  little bit of a pass, but I got to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=144.9s)]
*  give him a little bit of a pass [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=146.6s)]
*  because I live in a glass house, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  okay? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=149.6s)]
*  I got a little taste of some of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=150.16s)]
*  the policies that I thought would [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=152.12s)]
*  be good, and I didn't like it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  And I changed my mind once I was [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=157.44s)]
*  impacted by them. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  So I'm just going to keep it real. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=160.88s)]
*  I disagree with you because those [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  are not the policies we supported. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  No, they weren't. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=166.12s)]
*  But still. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  No, they did a three card Monte on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=168.04s)]
*  us. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=169.68s)]
*  We said reform cops because they're [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=170.22s)]
*  beating up and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  killing too many African-Americans [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=173.28s)]
*  by the way, overall Americans, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=175.42s)]
*  right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=177.33999999999997s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=178.54s)]
*  let's turn felonies into misdemeanors. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=180.17999999999998s)]
*  Why did anybody ask for that? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=182.98s)]
*  No one asked for that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  No one asked for that, right? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=185.98s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=186.82s)]
*  So it's a little bit of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=187.33999999999997s)]
*  apples and oranges. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=187.98s)]
*  In this case, though, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  it's at least good that he's saying [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  this on TV. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=192.5s)]
*  Yeah, sure, a lot of people might [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=193.17999999999998s)]
*  miss the hypocrisy of it, although [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  I think Howard Ford pointed it out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=196.7s)]
*  I give him credit for saying this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=198.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure he got backlash [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  for it because I'm not going to lie. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=202.08s)]
*  So far, based on what I'm seeing, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=204.86s)]
*  there's been favorability towards [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  Trump gutting federal agencies. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=210.58s)]
*  I think he's now starting to go too [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=213.38s)]
*  far. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=215.54000000000002s)]
*  But anytime a conservative speaks [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=216.58s)]
*  out against something Trump is [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=218.46s)]
*  doing, he's going to be met with [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=220.02s)]
*  backlash and where credit is due. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=221.58s)]
*  At least Jesse Waters was willing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=223.66s)]
*  to say what he said on TV. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=225.3s)]
*  I hear you loaded up with [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=226.74s)]
*  hypocrisy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=229.06s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=230.04s)]
*  I agree with you on that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=231.12s)]
*  But having said that, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=232.08s)]
*  the reason that I like it is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=233.08s)]
*  because it's getting the Fox News [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=234.38s)]
*  audience to go, I see, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=236.28s)]
*  some of the cuts might be bad. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  I didn't know they were cutting [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=239.44s)]
*  veterans, they're cutting veterans? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=241.24s)]
*  And so what I want them to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=243.88s)]
*  understand is, if you're actually [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=245.12s)]
*  cutting waste, fraud, and abuse, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=247.04s)]
*  you're actually going to be super [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=248.88s)]
*  popular in the, and whether the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=250.58s)]
*  Democrats complain about it or not, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=252.08s)]
*  the independents will love it, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=253.84s)]
*  etc. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=255.36s)]
*  But if you go cut blindly as they're [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=255.96s)]
*  doing now, how do you know if [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=258.14s)]
*  you're cutting fat or bone? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=260.0s)]
*  You don't, you're just cutting. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=262.82s)]
*  There, I took out your thigh, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=264.98s)]
*  oops. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=266.46s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=267.38s)]
*  Don't cut the bone, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=267.88s)]
*  you need the bone. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=268.7s)]
*  Yeah, so good analysis, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=269.7s)]
*  is it fat, is it muscle, is it bone? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=271.54s)]
*  Cut the fat, not the rest. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=274.7s)]
*  But by definition, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=276.38s)]
*  you're not doing that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=277.18s)]
*  If you come in and go, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=278.22s)]
*  I just fired all these people [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=279.3s)]
*  without even looking at who they [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  are. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=282.38s)]
*  Exactly, now look, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=282.9s)]
*  Jesse Waters actually is not the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=284.02s)]
*  only high profile right winger who [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=285.9s)]
*  has kind of spoken out against [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=288.8s)]
*  what's been happening, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  asking the Trump administration to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=291.44s)]
*  basically take a step back and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  maybe do this in a more [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=294.82s)]
*  methodical way. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=295.94s)]
*  Senator Lisa Murkowski, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  a Republican from Alaska, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=298.72s)]
*  also has concerns and told Axios of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=300.36s)]
*  her state's many federal workers, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=302.5s)]
*  quote, we all want efficiencies. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  There is a way to do it, and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=307.2s)]
*  the way these people have been [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=309.2s)]
*  treated has been awful in many [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=311.16s)]
*  cases, awful. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=313.04s)]
*  Cenk, yesterday, you weren't here, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=314.2s)]
*  but I covered a story reported in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=316.58s)]
*  the Washington Post about all of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=318.66s)]
*  these Republican Congress people [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=320.68s)]
*  who are now going to Trump hat in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=322.9s)]
*  hand, asking for federal funding [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=324.98s)]
*  that they had before he did [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=327.32s)]
*  the federal funding freeze. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=329.06s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=331.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=331.94s)]
*  But look here, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=332.5s)]
*  I'll do both sides of that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=333.5s)]
*  On the one hand, if you're that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=335.38s)]
*  Republican congressman, you're like, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=337.1s)]
*  okay, okay, we want to pretend to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=339.54s)]
*  do cuts, but don't do cuts for me. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=341.46s)]
*  Let's just do wildly political, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=343.66s)]
*  political cuts, where we just say, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=345.64s)]
*  hey, let's punish the other sides [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=347.72s)]
*  voters, take their money away, but [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=349.68s)]
*  yeah, give me the pork, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=351.72s)]
*  I want the pork, right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=353.0s)]
*  So that's totally unacceptable. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=354.4s)]
*  But if Trump sticks to his guns, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=356.12s)]
*  at least even if I think cutting [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=357.96s)]
*  fat and muscle and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=359.8s)]
*  bone at the same time is dumb, but [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=361.0s)]
*  he doesn't give special exemptions [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=363.12s)]
*  to Republican Congress people, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=365.34000000000003s)]
*  then I'll say, well, okay, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=367.36s)]
*  at least it was across the board, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=369.0s)]
*  and he did cut, and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=371.02s)]
*  he didn't discriminate. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=372.4s)]
*  But that jury's out, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  we know the Republicans are going, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=375.18s)]
*  please be a hypocrite, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=376.82000000000005s)]
*  be a hypocrite, and we'll see if [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=378.06s)]
*  they get their wish. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=379.6s)]
*  I'm going to give you one [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=380.70000000000005s)]
*  interesting quote because it was [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=382.70000000000005s)]
*  given to Axios anonymously. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=385.66s)]
*  It's a House Republican. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  And I think the fact that he gave, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=391.02000000000004s)]
*  he or she gave this quote [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=393.3s)]
*  anonymously kind of voids what [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=394.98s)]
*  this person is saying. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=397.14000000000004s)]
*  So let's go to graphic four. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=398.78000000000003s)]
*  In regard to a constitutional [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=401.5s)]
*  crisis spurred by Donald Trump's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=403.32s)]
*  administration, he says, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  I think you're going to see a clash [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  when they start abolishing agencies. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=409.0s)]
*  Say like USAID, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=412.12s)]
*  We authorize that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=414.6s)]
*  That's a creature of Congress. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=415.92s)]
*  If they try to do something like [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=417.6s)]
*  that, then you're going to get into [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=419.44s)]
*  a constitutional argument or crisis. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=421.6s)]
*  Even though it's our guy in [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=425.04s)]
*  the White House, if there's a lot [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=426.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=437.9s)]
*  He might feel that maybe they're [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=438.46s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=451.46s)]
*  Right, he didn't give his name [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPNElaXfpc&t=452.06s)]
