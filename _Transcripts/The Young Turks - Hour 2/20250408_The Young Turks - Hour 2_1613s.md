"Rep. Greg Casar wants Democrats to ‚Äúpick villains‚Äù in the GOP and drop purity tests in primaries.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus chair, a 35-year-old Texas millennial who took over its leadership in December, thinks his party lost its working-class identity, while becoming too cautious and too boring in its fight against Republicans. He‚Äôs meeting privately with other members to discuss ways to steer the party toward a more populist economic message ‚Äî being ‚Äúknown as the party of working people, first and foremost,‚Äù Casar said ‚Äî and he‚Äôs mounting an aggressive public relations campaign to push it."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

*  Caucus in Congress. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=3.58s)]
*  And he has a really interesting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=4.74s)]
*  plan for how to get Democrats to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=6.42s)]
*  back down the path to victory. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=8.16s)]
*  He talked about it with [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=10.22s)]
*  Politico recently. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to give you one quote [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=12.06s)]
*  here, he said, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=13.38s)]
*  Kassar thinks his party lost his [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=14.14s)]
*  working class identity while [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  becoming too cautious and too [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=17.32s)]
*  boring in his fight against [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=18.82s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=20.22s)]
*  He's meeting privately with other [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=21.78s)]
*  members to discuss ways to steer [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=23.3s)]
*  the party toward a more populist [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=24.6s)]
*  economic message, being known as [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  the party of working people first [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=27.68s)]
*  and foremost, Kassar said. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=29.36s)]
*  And he's mounting an aggressive [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=30.8s)]
*  public relations campaign to push [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=32.44s)]
*  it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=34.08s)]
*  He is indeed because he's right [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=34.6s)]
*  here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=36.04s)]
*  Representative Kassar, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=36.54s)]
*  thank you for joining us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=37.64s)]
*  Interesting path and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=38.8s)]
*  we want to talk to you about it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=39.84s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=42.36s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=43.32s)]
*  No problem. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=44.4s)]
*  So let me start in on that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  So to me, that is the most obvious [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=47.28s)]
*  thing in the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=49.76s)]
*  So thank you, makes sense. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=51.2s)]
*  And make sense as you've said in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=53.56s)]
*  other areas too that, quote, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=55.6s)]
*  make sure that the central brand [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=58.08s)]
*  speaks to everyone. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  But Representative Kassar, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  you know that not everybody agrees [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=62.68s)]
*  with that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=64.56s)]
*  And so there's folks who say no, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=65.16s)]
*  push for on any issue that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=67.52s)]
*  the Republicans fight you on, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=69.4s)]
*  die on every hill, fight on every [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=71.64s)]
*  one of those issues, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=73.8s)]
*  including social issues, etc. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=75.08s)]
*  So how do you respond to those good [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=77.44s)]
*  folks who just have a different [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=79.72s)]
*  strategy? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=81.88s)]
*  Yeah, look, I believe that we have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=83.8s)]
*  to be able to defend [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=86.28s)]
*  vulnerable Americans. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=87.68s)]
*  I care about that deeply, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  even when an issue isn't the most [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=91.12s)]
*  popular, isn't popular yet. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  But that can't be our primary [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=95.12s)]
*  brand. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  We aren't able to defend [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=98.48s)]
*  vulnerable people or [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=99.76s)]
*  people that are marginalized or [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  the rights of people that aren't as [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  popular yet if we don't have [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  the trust of the vast majority [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=106.48s)]
*  of Americans. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=108.48s)]
*  And so we have to have that popular [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=109.72s)]
*  populist economic brand that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  is the economic brand first to be [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  able to do the kind of defending [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  of the vulnerable that we also [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=119.76s)]
*  want to have a mandate to do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  Look, I'm from Texas where you [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  actually have had Democratic Party [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  victories when I was just about to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=128.16s)]
*  be born, sometimes from progressive [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=130.36s)]
*  populists in Texas who would win [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=132.84s)]
*  over rural Texas. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=135.0s)]
*  Basically with voters who would [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  say, look, I may not fully agree [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=138.8s)]
*  with you on this social issue or [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=140.44s)]
*  that one, but that person, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=142.08s)]
*  Jim Hightower, for example, having [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  been our statewide Ag Commissioner, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=145.44s)]
*  they said, well, we may not agree [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=147.28s)]
*  with Jim on every liberal idea on [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=148.76s)]
*  this or that, but at the end of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=150.24s)]
*  the day, he's not for big ag. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=151.48s)]
*  He's for making sure that I as a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=152.88s)]
*  small rancher or [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=154.84s)]
*  small producer gets a decent price [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=155.8s)]
*  or I as a consumer or worker [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  doesn't get screwed at [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=159.6s)]
*  the grocery store. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=161.04s)]
*  And they'd vote for guys like Jim [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  Hightower, a progressive Democrat, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=164.16s)]
*  because they knew he was for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=166.28s)]
*  their pocketbooks first. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=167.76s)]
*  And then you could have some [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=169.28s)]
*  disagreements on other issues, but [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=170.28s)]
*  at the end of the day, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  a worker or small business really [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=173.04s)]
*  came first. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  During this past presidential [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=176.2s)]
*  election, I'm sure you know, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump was able to expand his [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  base of supporters with a lot of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  individuals who actually had voted [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=184.48s)]
*  for Democrats their entire lives. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=186.84s)]
*  Now, part of the reason why was [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  because of what happened with [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=190.84s)]
*  the whole Biden mental decline [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=192.32s)]
*  debacle. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=194.04s)]
*  But part of it is because of what [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=195.12s)]
*  you've been raising some alarm [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=197.0s)]
*  over, which is the fact that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=198.76s)]
*  Americans feel that the Democrats [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=200.28s)]
*  party has kind of abandoned [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=202.35999999999999s)]

*  And so what do you have to say in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=205.88s)]
*  response to critics who look at [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=208.2s)]
*  the base of the Democratic party? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=210.56s)]
*  And notice that there has been [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=213.72s)]
*  an influx of college educated, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  well earning American voters. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  And maybe their interests conflict [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=223.4s)]
*  with the interests of working class [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=226.04s)]
*  voters who really are in need of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=228.84s)]
*  a more robust social safety net. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=231.4s)]
*  They might actually have things [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=233.96s)]
*  that they care about more as [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=236.68s)]
*  opposed to the other side of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=238.96s)]
*  the Democratic electorate. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=241.24s)]
*  How do you create a coalition where [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=243.68s)]
*  the two actually do mesh with each [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=246.28s)]
*  other well and want the same types [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=248.72s)]
*  of policies? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=251.12s)]
*  Because I feel like those who are [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=252.08s)]
*  highly college educated, who have [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=254.04s)]
*  really well paying jobs in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=256.16s)]
*  the Democratic base, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=257.88s)]
*  are more interested in pushing for [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=259.67999999999995s)]
*  the social issues that might not be [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=261.67999999999995s)]
*  popular with the other side of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=263.67999999999995s)]
*  the Democratic base. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=265.47999999999996s)]
*  How do you kind of get them to work [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=266.67999999999995s)]
*  together? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=268.44s)]
*  We have to build a bigger tent and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=270.12s)]
*  a bigger coalition party. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=272.52s)]
*  Look in the 2017-2018 backlash to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=274.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, it was great [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=277.2s)]
*  activism and great organizing and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=279.2s)]
*  we're starting to feel that now and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=281.44s)]
*  we should channel that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=283.84s)]
*  But too often we thought we could [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  build a bigger sized tent instead [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=287.56s)]
*  of expanding our tent. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=289.64s)]
*  So I think at this moment where [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=291.12s)]
*  there's real organizing and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=292.96s)]
*  real energy and a backlash against [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=294.6s)]
*  the horrible Trump musk abuses, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=296.6s)]
*  we can't make the same mistakes we [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=298.6s)]
*  made seven or eight years ago. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=300.44s)]
*  We've got to come in with a message [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=302.24s)]
*  that can actually bring people of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=304.16s)]
*  all sorts of backgrounds together, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=306.08s)]
*  which is these guys think that you [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=308.08s)]
*  work to make them rich. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=310.0s)]
*  These guys think that you pay taxes [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=311.52s)]
*  to make them rich, and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=313.68s)]
*  that's deeply wrong. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=315.08s)]
*  We have a message of the 99% [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=316.52s)]
*  against the 1% and that actually [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=318.28s)]
*  can hold that broader coalition [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=320.24s)]
*  together. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  But to your point, I actually also [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=323.08s)]
*  believe that we can have that big [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=325.28s)]
*  of a tent, but the foundation of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=327.44s)]
*  that tent has to be working class [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=329.64s)]
*  voters. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=331.88s)]
*  Because the very purpose of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  the Democratic Party is supposed to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  be to fight for the needs of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=336.84s)]
*  the working class and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  the working person first. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  We will ultimately become irrelevant [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  and lose our purpose if we continue [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=343.79999999999995s)]
*  to lose working class voters. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=346.04s)]
*  And we could become incoherent as [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=348.32s)]
*  a party if our purpose was supposed [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  to be for the working class. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=352.12s)]
*  But then we lose so [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=353.84s)]
*  many working class voters that as [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=354.64s)]
*  you said, we start winding up with [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=356.4s)]
*  a constituency that actually is not [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=358.32s)]
*  coherent around an anti-oligarchy [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=360.48s)]
*  working class message. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=362.96s)]
*  So the Republicans could send [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=364.92s)]
*  the Democratic Party the way of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=366.24s)]
*  the wigs, we could just close up [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=367.64s)]
*  shop and don't even need to be [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=369.12s)]
*  a party anymore. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=370.64s)]
*  If we don't focus on regaining [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=371.68s)]
*  the trust of those working class [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=373.28s)]
*  voters, and for the first time in [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=375.12s)]
*  my time in politics, I hear from [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  members of Congress and leaders [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  from all different wings of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=380.68s)]
*  the party who agree that this is [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=382.08s)]
*  a serious problem. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=383.68s)]
*  Used to be in denial about it [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=384.68s)]
*  being a problem, now it is just [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=386.12s)]
*  right up in our faces. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=387.8s)]
*  Yeah, so that's actually, to me, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=388.96s)]
*  the real heart of the issue. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=391.12s)]
*  And I want to get back to your [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  colleagues in a second because [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=394.24s)]
*  that's so important. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=395.88s)]
*  But so far, everything you've said [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  is music to my ears. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=399.0s)]
*  It makes tons of sense, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=400.2s)]
*  economic populism, well, that's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=401.24s)]
*  what the Democratic Party is about, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=402.88s)]
*  basically you build up leverage. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  And you build up the credibility [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=406.28s)]
*  to go to the voters and say, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=408.12s)]
*  now can you agree with us on this [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  and this and this, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=411.56s)]
*  So now having said all that about [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=413.24s)]
*  the Democratic Party brand, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  you're the head of the progressive [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  caucus now. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=418.28s)]
*  And so I'm curious, as the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=418.84s)]
*  progressive brand has been [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  interpreted in different ways, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=423.0s)]
*  some positive, some negative, and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=425.64s)]
*  differently on economic issues and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=428.44s)]
*  social issues and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  cultural war issues. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=432.6s)]
*  What do you think the brand of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=435.44s)]
*  progressive should be? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  I think that the original [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=439.92s)]
*  progressive populist brand of [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=441.4s)]
*  about 100 years ago, we've got to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=443.2s)]
*  bring that back to the center of [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=445.32s)]
*  what being a progressive is. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=447.16s)]
*  And I hope that that actually helps [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=449.56s)]
*  transform the Democratic Party as [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  well. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=452.84s)]
*  And if I were to put it very [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=453.34s)]
*  succinctly in this moment, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=454.8s)]
*  it would be that the point of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=456.42s)]
*  the Democratic Party is to break [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=458.28s)]
*  the unholy alliance between [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=461.24s)]
*  corporate greed and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=462.8s)]
*  corrupt government and stop. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=464.0s)]
*  If that's what progressives rally [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=466.88s)]
*  around right now as Elon Musk is [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=468.8s)]
*  plundering our government, then I [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=470.48s)]
*  think people can come to understand [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=472.44s)]
*  progressivism as something that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  can be broadly supported. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=476.0s)]
*  And actually a lot of folks that I [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=477.36s)]
*  know in places like Texas that call [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=478.92s)]
*  themselves, I'm pretty [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=480.68s)]
*  conservative on some issues. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=481.92s)]
*  They actually agree with what I [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=483.68s)]
*  just said. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=485.0s)]
*  And I don't really care if they [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=485.72s)]
*  want to call themselves progressive [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  or conservative or whatever. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=488.52000000000004s)]
*  I think if they can be inside of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=490.0s)]
*  that tent of breaking the alliance [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=491.8s)]
*  between the greedy people that buy [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=493.8s)]
*  our government and by politicians [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=495.8s)]
*  in order to screw you in [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=497.8s)]
*  the marketplace. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=499.12s)]
*  I think that's exactly where we [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=500.44s)]
*  need to be. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=501.88s)]
*  You've talked about the progressive [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=503.12s)]
*  caucus, I still believe that our [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=504.64s)]
*  caucus and progressive members of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=506.24s)]
*  Congress need to defend the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=507.96s)]
*  vulnerable and the marginalized, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=509.28s)]
*  need to be able to stand up on [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=511.08s)]
*  causes that aren't fully popular [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=512.44s)]
*  yet. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=514.16s)]
*  Look, if we don't speak out against [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=514.68s)]
*  how Donald Trump is circumventing [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=516.76s)]
*  the rising due process to send [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=518.68s)]
*  people to prison camps in El [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=520.24s)]
*  Salvador, if we don't do that, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=521.64s)]
*  then nobody's going to do that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=523.36s)]
*  We gotta still do that work. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=525.08s)]
*  But we also need to lean in to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  these popular movements that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  frankly are where we came from in [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=530.52s)]
*  the first place and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=532.72s)]
*  I think we've got to get back to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=533.76s)]
*  that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=535.56s)]
*  I have to be honest with you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=536.08s)]
*  So I have no problem with [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=538.52s)]
*  the Democratic Party taking jobs at [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=539.92s)]
*  the Trump administration when it [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=542.08s)]
*  makes sense. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=544.04s)]
*  I do have a problem with the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=544.8s)]
*  Democratic Party over the last [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=546.4s)]
*  year really centering Donald Trump [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  in all of their campaigning, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  fear mongering about Trump instead [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=552.4s)]
*  of showing us what the vision for [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=554.6s)]
*  the Democratic Party is. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=556.6s)]
*  What are Democrats going to do for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=558.2s)]
*  Americans? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=560.44s)]
*  Real quick, when it comes to [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=561.5600000000001s)]
*  attacking Trump, I find that it [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=563.6800000000001s)]
*  oftentimes does focus on, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=566.2s)]
*  he said something racist or [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=568.42s)]
*  he said something sexist, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=570.48s)]
*  which is bad, sure. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=572.44s)]
*  But there's been plenty of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=573.88s)]
*  messaging from Democrats on that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=575.28s)]
*  The Senate just passed their [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=577.64s)]
*  version of what the budget is [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=579.32s)]
*  going to look like and they added [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=580.96s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars in [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=582.88s)]
*  additional tax cuts for the rich. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=584.96s)]
*  And what's really interesting is, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=587.28s)]
*  I haven't seen much from [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=589.44s)]
*  the Democratic Party in their [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=590.78s)]
*  messaging against that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=592.4s)]
*  There hasn't really been much [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=594.0s)]
*  focus on those bread and butter [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=595.64s)]
*  economic issues when they decide to [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=597.38s)]
*  message against the Trump [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=599.48s)]
*  administration and what he's up to. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=601.12s)]
*  And I want to understand why, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  because the fear mongering about [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=605.4s)]
*  Trump has existed for some time [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=607.28s)]
*  now and the last election made it [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=609.16s)]
*  clear that that kind of messaging [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=611.0799999999999s)]
*  isn't working. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=613.0s)]
*  Americans are fatigued by it or [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=613.8399999999999s)]
*  from it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=615.9599999999999s)]
*  So what is the conversation behind [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=617.12s)]
*  the scenes among Democrats when it [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=619.28s)]
*  comes to messaging? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=621.42s)]
*  Is there going to be like a [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=622.72s)]
*  cohesion in how they're going to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=624.1999999999999s)]
*  move forward or is there no [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=626.28s)]
*  discussion about it at all? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=628.02s)]
*  Yeah, behind closed doors, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=630.12s)]
*  I've been very clear to people that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=632.12s)]
*  if in this moment of backlash, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=634.56s)]
*  and renewed organizing, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=637.5999999999999s)]
*  if the Democratic Party just [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=639.28s)]
*  becomes known as anti-Trump instead [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=640.9399999999999s)]
*  of pro-worker, then we have totally [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=643.16s)]
*  screwed this up. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=646.68s)]
*  Because as you know, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=647.1999999999999s)]
*  they're sort of the back and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=648.1999999999999s)]
*  forth of midterm elections. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=649.4799999999999s)]
*  And with all of the energy we see [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=651.04s)]
*  in the electorate, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  I feel pretty bullish that [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=653.88s)]
*  Democrats will retake the House in [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=655.3599999999999s)]
*  the upcoming midterms. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  But if we retake the House and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  say the way we retake it is just by [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  being anti-Trump, then I think we [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=662.12s)]
*  have, like I said, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=664.04s)]
*  missed an opportunity or [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=665.16s)]
*  much worse than that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=666.82s)]
*  Because we have to take this [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=668.2s)]
*  opportunity to be known as [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=669.68s)]
*  anti-corruption, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=671.12s)]
*  not just anti-Trump. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=672.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=673.08s)]
*  As pro-worker, not just pro [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=673.58s)]
*  politics as usual or status quo. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=675.88s)]
*  And I think you're exactly right [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=679.2s)]
*  that I think the voters at this [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=681.04s)]
*  point have said, well, look, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=682.62s)]
*  we know that he's offensive. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=684.36s)]
*  We know he can act strange and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=687.04s)]
*  weird and is erratic and [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=688.48s)]
*  is disrespectful. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=689.6s)]
*  But what does that mean for me? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=691.12s)]
*  And I think we need to tell folks [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=693.24s)]
*  that what it means for them is that [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=694.84s)]
*  they are picking your pocket and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=696.68s)]
*  making you work more hours. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=698.48s)]
*  And we need to have, as you said, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=700.8s)]
*  an alternative vision for [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=702.48s)]
*  what it is that we would do. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=703.84s)]
*  And I hope that over the course of [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=705.64s)]
*  the next year, as we head into sort [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=707.28s)]
*  of Democratic primary election [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=709.0s)]
*  season, some of these special [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=710.68s)]
*  elections, that we come up with [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=712.16s)]
*  a new set of economic populist [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=713.84s)]
*  ideas. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=715.6s)]
*  Of course, there's some great ones [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=716.16s)]
*  from the past. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=717.84s)]
*  But look, we're not just running, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=718.6s)]
*  we're on Bernie 2016, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=720.6s)]
*  although that was an amazing [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=722.0s)]
*  campaign. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=723.64s)]
*  But I hope that there's a [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=724.32s)]
*  resurgence of the antitrust [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  movement and taking on corporate [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=727.2s)]
*  monopolies. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  And a real resurgence of how we can [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  change labor law to really benefit [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=732.1600000000001s)]
*  unionization at a moment where [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=734.12s)]
*  Trump has gotten rid of collective [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=735.9200000000001s)]
*  bargaining for 1.5 million people [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  in the federal government last week. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=739.84s)]
*  So I think exactly to your point, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=741.8000000000001s)]
*  I've heard a lot of anti-Trump [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=743.32s)]
*  stuff, but not much about 1.5 [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=744.84s)]
*  million people losing their [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=746.32s)]
*  collective bargaining rights. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=747.6400000000001s)]
*  And that's exactly what I think [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=749.24s)]
*  progressives need to lead [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=750.96s)]
*  the change on. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=752.44s)]
*  Because I think if we win some [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=753.5999999999999s)]
*  races with that kind of economics [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=755.28s)]
*  populist messaging, then I think [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=757.28s)]
*  the Democratic Party has a chance [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=759.28s)]
*  to follow the voters and to learn [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=761.28s)]
*  some good lessons about putting [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=763.3599999999999s)]
*  forward strong economic plans and [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  not just being anti-Trump. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=767.5999999999999s)]
*  And again, I start to say that I'm [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=769.4799999999999s)]
*  not extremely against what [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=771.3599999999999s)]
*  the President is doing. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=772.88s)]
*  But we have to be against it for [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=774.4s)]
*  an economic reason, not just because [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=776.2399999999999s)]
*  he offends us, which of course, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=778.4799999999999s)]
*  he's offensive, but that's a trap. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=780.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so look, this is amazing to [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=782.4s)]
*  hear. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=787.4s)]
*  Other than Ro Khanna, there's not [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=789.04s)]
*  a lot of other politicians we've [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=790.64s)]
*  interviewed to where we completely [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=792.1999999999999s)]
*  agree. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=793.88s)]
*  Okay, and then with Ro, we had our [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  discriminations during the binary, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=796.64s)]
*  which I actually want to ask you a [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=799.0s)]
*  little bit about in a second too. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=800.84s)]
*  But it's amazing to hear the head [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=802.8s)]
*  of the Progressive Caucus that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=804.56s)]
*  should agree with us, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=806.3199999999999s)]
*  actually agree with us. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=807.6s)]
*  So that's beautiful. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=809.4s)]
*  But I want to talk about a little [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=811.24s)]
*  bit some other tactics here. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  One last thing about, I want to [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=814.4000000000001s)]
*  really get to the corporate [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=815.5200000000001s)]
*  Democrats in a second, but [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=816.5600000000001s)]
*  one last thing about other [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=817.6s)]
*  strategies and tactics, right? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=818.6800000000001s)]
*  So I hope that everybody on our [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=820.6s)]
*  side agrees on the policies in [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=821.88s)]
*  general, right? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=823.2s)]
*  We're allowed to have [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=824.5200000000001s)]
*  disagreements around the edges, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=825.24s)]
*  it's no big deal. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=826.48s)]
*  You can't have a party where [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=827.5200000000001s)]
*  everybody agrees 100%, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=828.6800000000001s)]
*  that doesn't make any sense, right? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  But there are some folks who say [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=831.6400000000001s)]
*  strategically don't talk to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=833.12s)]
*  the right wing. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=834.48s)]
*  Or if you do talk to the right wing, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=835.2800000000001s)]
*  don't concede anything, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=837.48s)]
*  you just make sure you yell at them [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  and prove them wrong. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=841.3199999999999s)]
*  What do you think about [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=843.0799999999999s)]
*  that strategy? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=844.0s)]
*  Well, look, the message that I just [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=844.6s)]
*  gave you guys here on the Young [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=847.16s)]
*  Turks is the exact same message I [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=849.0799999999999s)]
*  used on Fox News Sunday live, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=851.4s)]
*  is the exact same message I used on [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=853.52s)]
*  Univision in Spanish last week. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=855.88s)]
*  And it's the exact same message I [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=858.52s)]
*  gave on stage with Senator Sanders [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=860.56s)]
*  and AOC the other day in Arizona. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=862.68s)]
*  And that's the point, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=864.92s)]
*  if we put central to our politics [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=867.16s)]
*  the things that most people care [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=869.0799999999999s)]
*  about, that's how democracy should [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=871.12s)]
*  work. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=873.4s)]
*  And so I actually recently went and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=873.92s)]
*  did a town hall in Chip Roy's [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  district. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=878.2399999999999s)]
*  He is a leader in the right wing [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  Freedom Caucus, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=881.3199999999999s)]
*  went to Tripping Springs, Texas. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  It's a town of like 8,500 people, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=884.4399999999999s)]
*  and 400 folks showed up. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=887.04s)]
*  And of course, there were lots of [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=889.88s)]
*  Democrats and progressives there. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=891.28s)]
*  But there were independents too, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=892.92s)]
*  who said that they'd felt [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=894.56s)]
*  disaffected and [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=895.84s)]
*  abandoned by both parties. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=896.6800000000001s)]
*  And if we have this kind of message [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=898.32s)]
*  that says, not only are we going to [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=900.0s)]
*  defend social security, but [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=901.64s)]
*  we can expand it by making sure that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=903.12s)]
*  we tax incomes over $400,000 for [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=904.88s)]
*  social security in the same way we [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=906.76s)]
*  tax incomes under $400,000. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  That's the kind of thing that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=911.0400000000001s)]
*  brings those disaffected voters in. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=912.2s)]
*  And so I'm happy to go talk to [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=913.88s)]
*  anyone and I think it's especially [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=915.76s)]
*  useful for us to find a message [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=918.0400000000001s)]
*  that we can consistently use on [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=919.96s)]
*  this program and Fox News. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=921.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, couldn't agree more. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=923.52s)]
*  Let me now ask you about [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=924.4s)]
*  the corporate wing because that's [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=925.56s)]
*  where Matt Bennett, the Third Way [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=927.48s)]
*  and all those groups come into [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=929.28s)]
*  play and they criticize you saying, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=930.72s)]
*  well, demanding economic populism [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=932.68s)]
*  is its own form of purity test. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=934.8s)]
*  Why do you think that that's not [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=937.9599999999999s)]
*  the case? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=939.12s)]
*  I mean, first of all, I don't even [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=940.76s)]
*  know if I fully understand that [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=942.84s)]
*  his point there. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=944.68s)]
*  But if you look at what Third Way [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=945.72s)]
*  put in their report, they went out [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=948.64s)]
*  there and advocated against [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=952.24s)]
*  grassroots funding of campaigns. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=954.36s)]
*  They said we need to listen less to [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=957.56s)]
*  those donors that give $2 and [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=959.12s)]
*  $3 a year. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=960.4399999999999s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=962.08s)]
*  That sounds to me like they want to [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=963.0s)]
*  listen more to the people that give [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=964.52s)]
*  $2 and $3 million a year. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=966.12s)]
*  That's a losing strategy. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=968.0s)]
*  Look, I'm the head of [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=970.16s)]
*  the Progressive Caucus and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm not coming on here to tell you [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=973.04s)]
*  that everything every progressive [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=974.84s)]
*  has ever done has always helped us [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=976.76s)]
*  win campaigns. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=978.52s)]
*  So it's not true. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=979.28s)]
*  We're not perfect. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=980.2s)]
*  We make mistakes. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=981.16s)]

*  leverage? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1066.88s)]
*  I mean, the Biden administration [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1067.5600000000002s)]
*  had a lot of progressives in the [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1069.4s)]

*  in regard to economic policies, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1078.72s)]

*  what they want included in [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1094.0s)]

*  Of course, we're going to make [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1097.24s)]
*  putting progressive economic policy [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1099.32s)]
*  front and center. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1101.8s)]
*  And if we are back in a majority [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1103.4s)]
*  and have the ability to get [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  something signed by a president, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1106.56s)]
*  look, when we get there, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1108.44s)]
*  we'll talk about it, but [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1109.8400000000001s)]
*  we will be forceful at that time. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1111.2s)]
*  And here's what I think is really [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1113.32s)]
*  interesting and maybe different in [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1115.16s)]
*  a future Democratic trifecta than [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1117.28s)]
*  the one that we had in the past. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1119.32s)]
*  In the past, there was this idea [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1121.04s)]
*  that if the policy was too [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1123.04s)]
*  progressive, if the housing policy [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1124.76s)]
*  covered too many people, if the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1126.92s)]
*  drug price negotiating hit big [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1128.96s)]
*  pharma too hard, that could cost [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1131.0800000000002s)]
*  us electorally. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1133.4s)]
*  You know what? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1134.64s)]
*  I hope we're past that time where [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1136.04s)]
*  we actually think about, no, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1138.04s)]
*  we will actually suffer in [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1139.8000000000002s)]
*  the elections if the policy isn't [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1141.3600000000001s)]
*  universal enough. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1143.44s)]
*  Is it bold enough? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1145.1200000000001s)]
*  And look, maybe we could call that [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1146.64s)]
*  progressive, but maybe actually we [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1148.6000000000001s)]
*  should just start calling it [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1150.76s)]
*  strategic, because if a policy is [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1152.48s)]
*  only means tested for certain [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1154.6000000000001s)]
*  set of people and it takes a certain [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1156.56s)]
*  number of years for it to [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1158.52s)]
*  incrementally or technocratically [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1159.72s)]
*  be put in effect, then we might [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1161.68s)]
*  lose elections over that. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1163.2s)]
*  And so I hope that we don't [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1164.56s)]
*  actually have to go and [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1166.28s)]
*  threaten to nuke things. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1167.68s)]
*  I hope instead we're at a place [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1170.16s)]

*  hold this place together, if we [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1178.44s)]
*  don't want future Donald Trumps and [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1180.1200000000001s)]
*  JD Advances and more nihilism and [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1182.04s)]
*  destruction of our basic rights, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1183.88s)]

*  easy to explain way. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1230.36s)]
*  And I don't think that's just [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1232.12s)]
*  progressive anymore. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1233.32s)]
*  I hope that that is the best [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1234.08s)]
*  anti-authoritarian medicine that [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1235.6s)]
*  we can deliver. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1237.4799999999998s)]
*  Okay, so look, this has been [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1238.8799999999999s)]
*  an agreement fest and I wanted to [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1240.56s)]
*  say amen and hallelujah as you [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1242.6399999999999s)]
*  were talking about that. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1244.68s)]
*  But now, let's get to a tough issue [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1246.0s)]
*  here because on the strategy, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1248.4s)]
*  again, we agree completely, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1250.48s)]
*  you've got to hold the line. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1252.52s)]
*  If you don't use your leverage, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1254.8400000000001s)]
*  there was no point in having [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1255.96s)]
*  the leverage. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1257.0s)]
*  That being said, that is not what [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1257.92s)]
*  the Progressive Caucus did [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1259.8400000000001s)]
*  in the past. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1261.44s)]
*  They had the most maddening [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1262.6000000000001s)]
*  strategy, it was called Trust Biden. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1264.52s)]
*  And today I saw on the paper that [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1267.48s)]
*  the Republicans are saying, yeah, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1268.96s)]
*  these tariffs are maniacal, but [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1270.64s)]
*  we have a Trust Trump strategy. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1272.24s)]
*  These strategies are abysmal. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1274.28s)]
*  And so I don't want to get into [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1276.6399999999999s)]
*  how corporatist Biden was, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1279.08s)]
*  we don't need to do that. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1281.56s)]
*  But the idea that you just don't [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1283.44s)]
*  use your leverage is crazy. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1285.92s)]
*  And so if, look, I know we're not [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1288.28s)]
*  anywhere near there yet, and [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1290.72s)]
*  that you've got the right path here [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1292.92s)]
*  on reestablishing the brand, etc. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1295.3999999999999s)]
*  But for that brand to stick, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1297.92s)]
*  you've got to actually deliver. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1299.76s)]
*  And what I'm worried about, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1302.0s)]
*  is that if the Democrats get back [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1303.6s)]
*  in charge, your colleagues will [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1305.6399999999999s)]
*  turn on you, and they won't want to [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1307.92s)]
*  pass any of these bills. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1310.48s)]
*  Paid family leaves at 84%, and [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1313.04s)]
*  the Democrats couldn't find a way [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1315.16s)]
*  to pass it, $15 minimum wage over [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1317.4s)]
*  two-thirds, and Joe Biden had it [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1319.6399999999999s)]
*  taken out of the bill first. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1321.68s)]
*  Public options at over 70%, and [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1323.2s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't even propose it, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1325.2s)]
*  even though he promised it on [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1327.24s)]
*  the campaign trail. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1328.92s)]
*  So if I'm being honest with you, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1330.16s)]
*  and that's what we do, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1331.84s)]
*  trust almost any of your colleagues. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1333.52s)]
*  So how are you going to get these [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1335.68s)]
*  guys who've blocked every [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1337.52s)]
*  economically populous bill in [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1339.2s)]
*  the past with excuses about [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  parliamentarians, etc., [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1342.76s)]
*  to actually pass these bills? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1344.44s)]
*  Otherwise, what we're going to do [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1346.88s)]
*  is we're going to build up hope [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1348.08s)]
*  again and let people down again, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1349.24s)]
*  and then the party will never [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1350.6s)]
*  recover. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1351.84s)]
*  Look, I'm going to be honest with [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1354.28s)]
*  you, I'm worried about that too. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1355.68s)]
*  And I'm just trying to figure out [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1357.56s)]
*  what our options are, right? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1359.04s)]
*  We have to build up organizing and [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1360.48s)]
*  fight and you lose and you lose and [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1362.12s)]
*  you lose until you win. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1363.72s)]
*  And I hope that when we get the [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1365.4399999999998s)]
*  chance again, that we can really [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1368.04s)]
*  hold the line. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1370.9199999999998s)]
*  At the end of the day, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1373.1599999999999s)]
*  as we're seeing right now, look, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1374.1599999999999s)]
*  the courts aren't the ultimate [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1375.9199999999998s)]
*  check and balance here, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1377.56s)]
*  the Congress isn't the ultimate [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1378.76s)]
*  check and balance. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1380.36s)]
*  The ultimate check and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1381.48s)]
*  balance here is the people. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1382.36s)]
*  And that's why I think organized [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1383.72s)]
*  movements, organized labor, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1385.76s)]
*  people being ready to push when [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1387.8s)]
*  the time comes, and [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1389.8799999999999s)]
*  when the time comes is so critical [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1391.24s)]
*  because we just don't do it on our [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1393.36s)]
*  own over here. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1395.36s)]
*  And so I'm not here trying to be [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1396.76s)]
*  Pollyanna, trying to make you false [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1398.28s)]
*  promises that I know we're going to [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1399.92s)]
*  get it done this time, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1401.48s)]
*  just give us a shot. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1402.36s)]
*  I'm here as one member of Congress [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1403.56s)]
*  with the real honor of having [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1405.76s)]
*  the trust frankly of the majority [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1407.68s)]
*  of our progressive caucus members [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1409.88s)]
*  laying out how I think we get to [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1412.36s)]
*  a better place from here. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1414.64s)]
*  And we don't have another Congress, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1416.8s)]
*  we don't have another country. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1419.64s)]
*  And frankly, I could see things [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1422.24s)]
*  getting much even worse than this [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1424.2s)]
*  dark moment if we don't figure [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1426.2s)]
*  this problem out. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1427.96s)]
*  So I'm going to give it my all and [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1428.8400000000001s)]
*  then I can't, there's no promise. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1431.24s)]
*  But except my promise that I think [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1434.16s)]
*  that if we take this moment to let [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1436.8400000000001s)]
*  people know that we can actually [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1439.48s)]
*  win elections with a broader tent [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1441.92s)]
*  by being universalist and bold, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1444.52s)]
*  and show that that's in everybody's [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1447.08s)]
*  self interest, it's the best path [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1449.08s)]
*  that I've been able to come up with [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1451.1599999999999s)]
*  and I think about this day in and [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1453.04s)]
*  day out because I see how much [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1454.8s)]
*  suffering is being wrought just a [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1456.56s)]
*  couple of months into this [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1458.44s)]
*  administration. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1459.96s)]
*  Yeah, representative, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1460.92s)]
*  here's what I'm hearing. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1462.08s)]
*  I'm hearing that we've got [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1463.24s)]
*  a Pandora's box situation where all [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1464.72s)]
*  of the demons have been released [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1466.6s)]
*  from Pandora's box, but [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1468.36s)]
*  at the bottom there's hope. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1469.76s)]
*  And I have hope that the head of [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1471.3999999999999s)]
*  the progressive caucus is now [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1473.12s)]
*  And actually understands what it [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1475.1599999999999s)]
*  means to be a progressive, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1476.96s)]
*  economic populism, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1478.32s)]
*  fighting corporate power, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1479.52s)]
*  getting money out of politics and [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1481.04s)]
*  making sure that our democracy [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1482.76s)]
*  serves the voters, not the donors. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1484.36s)]
*  So thank you for bringing that [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1486.36s)]

*  All right, well, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1495.28s)]
*  hope to talk to you many times [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1495.96s)]
*  going forward. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1497.3999999999999s)]
*  All right, guys, so we did that [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1500.08s)]
*  instead of the bonus episode and [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1501.72s)]
*  instead of Operation Joy today. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1503.56s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1505.32s)]
*  That gave me joy. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1506.36s)]
*  So- [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1507.68s)]
*  Once he mentioned universal [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1509.18s)]
*  policies, I can't emphasize enough [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1510.84s)]
*  how much people are sick of the [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1513.2s)]
*  means testing and means tested [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1515.08s)]
*  policies are the flimsiest and [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1517.16s)]
*  most easy to repeal or [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1519.26s)]
*  chip away at. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1520.6s)]
*  Universal policies like social [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1522.8799999999999s)]
*  security, Medicare, Medicaid, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1524.8s)]
*  those policies are super important [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1527.0s)]
*  and difficult to do away with [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1529.32s)]
*  because of the fact that in the [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1531.08s)]
*  case of social security and [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1533.52s)]
*  Medicare, it's universal. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1535.12s)]
*  They don't means test you on that. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1536.72s)]
*  So- [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1538.24s)]
*  Yeah, and he made a point there [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1538.74s)]
*  that I hadn't thought of and [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1539.88s)]
*  it's a great point, which is, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1540.96s)]
*  he said, look, when we did those [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1542.52s)]
*  programs like social security and [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1544.52s)]
*  Medicare, we got people that were [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1546.68s)]
*  deeply against civil rights to vote [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1548.8s)]
*  for Democrats anyway, not because, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1550.96s)]
*  but despite- [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1553.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1554.52s)]
*  Are the Democrats being in favor of [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1555.32s)]
*  civil rights, those folks said, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1557.2s)]
*  well, you delivered for me. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1559.0s)]
*  That delivering economically means [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1560.72s)]
*  everything and by the way, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1563.2s)]
*  what then happened is that those [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1564.68s)]
*  people who were against civil [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1566.44s)]
*  rights because they were [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1567.96s)]
*  Democrats, a lot of them wound up [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  slowly moving to a position where [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1571.16s)]
*  they were in favor of civil rights. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1573.04s)]
*  because then they would gain their [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1575.52s)]
*  trust and deliver for them. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1577.4s)]
*  So man, that was hopeful. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1578.96s)]
*  I hope that brother has a lot of [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1582.24s)]
*  success in the house and like I [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1584.04s)]
*  said, hopefully we'll be talking to [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1585.8400000000001s)]
*  him a lot more going forward. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1587.92s)]
*  And last part of why that was such [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1589.72s)]
*  a relief is, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1592.16s)]
*  somebody's got a plan. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1592.96s)]
*  Okay, here, here, love that, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1596.16s)]
*  strategically correct and even, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1598.2s)]
*  like first of all, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1600.4s)]
*  has a strategy and then second of [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1601.44s)]
*  all, I happen to think his [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1603.16s)]
*  strategy is absolutely right. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1604.5600000000002s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1606.16s)]
*  an angel gets his wings, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1607.68s)]
*  totally not true, but it does keep [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1608.92s)]
*  you updated on our live shows. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6F9HBeSBk&t=1610.5600000000002s)]
