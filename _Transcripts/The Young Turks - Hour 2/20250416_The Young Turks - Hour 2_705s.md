"Ashley St. Clair wanted to prove that Elon Musk was the father of her newborn baby. 

But to ask the billionaire to take a paternity test, the right-wing social-media influencer had to go through Musk‚Äôs longtime fixer, Jared Birchall."

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# REVEALED: The CREEPY Way Musk Treats The Moms Of His Kids
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI)
*  What are the existential threats that humanity faces? We spent a lot of time talking about the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=0.0s)]
*  birthrate thing. But that might be the biggest single threat to the future of human civilization. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=6.08s)]
*  People just don't understand, nothing will make you happier than having kids. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  It will absolutely improve your happiness, not what have kids. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=17.6s)]
*  I agree with him there. I think that having kids can make you very happy. I have loved [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=23.36s)]
*  becoming a father. I think for a lot of people though, having the money to be able to have kids [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=27.84s)]
*  would be nice. I feel like you're missing something there, Elon Musk. But he's jumping [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=33.36s)]
*  way past the whole financing thing and he's not happy to just have kids. He wants to have apparently [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=36.88s)]
*  a legion of kids, his words. A new report by the Wall Street Journal has revealed how he is basically [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=43.04s)]
*  mass DMing influencers on Twitter with offers to knock them up. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=50.16s)]
*  And we're finding out about this thanks to Ashley St. Clair, one of the apparent mothers [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=54.8s)]
*  of one of his children. Or at least according to a court, not according to him actually acknowledging [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=60.08s)]
*  the kid after all that he's done and said in regards to her would be the honorable thing to do. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=66.0s)]
*  So clearly he's gone in the opposite direction. Anyway, she's a conservative influencer. And [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  you've probably seen that she's been feuding with Musk lately over the child that they have together. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=74.4s)]
*  Just bear in mind they had a court ordered paternity test that showed he had a 99.9999% [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=79.36s)]
*  chance of being the father or a 0.00001% chance of not. So you're telling me there's a chance. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=85.28s)]
*  Anyway, he apparently wants to have way more kids than the 14 or so that he publicly acknowledges. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  He refers to them as a legion of reference to the ancient military units that could contain [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=98.48s)]
*  thousands of soldiers and were key to extending the reach of the Roman Empire. We'd learned [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=102.88s)]
*  sometime last year that the average man thinks about Rome five times a day, not generally in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=108.16s)]
*  reference to the desire to reconstitute the empire with their own sperm. But that's a musk [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=112.8s)]
*  thing, I guess. Anyway, during St. Clair's pregnancy, he suggested to her that they bring [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=118.8s)]
*  in other women to have even more of their children faster to quote reach legion level before the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=124.08s)]
*  apocalypse. We will need to use surrogates. Now bear in mind he has a big compound in Austin, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=129.68s)]
*  Texas that he has some of his kids and their moms at. He wants to get all of them together [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=135.6s)]
*  where they'll definitely be comfortable. Anyway, he tried to get her there to spend time with the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=141.12s)]
*  kid legion. I just want you to bear in mind the other kids aren't hers and they're not married. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  She's not their stepmom or anything. She's just one of the women he propositioned online. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=154.72s)]
*  This is not as romantic as he's apparently convinced himself that it is. And so there's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=160.64s)]
*  more, it's gonna get weirder in a lot of different ways. He has a handler, Brett, this guy who helps [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=166.32s)]
*  to contact them with the offer to impregnate them and sets up the financial trap that provides for [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=172.72s)]
*  the kids while also stopping them from revealing what they've been subjected to. The whole thing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=180.24s)]
*  is weird. What do you think? The last thing, watching Elon on stage, the last thing I [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=184.88s)]
*  wanna think about is him having sex. I think it's exactly like the jump, but horizontal. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=189.92s)]
*  I've seen the literal underbelly of the beast. It's horrifying. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=199.04s)]
*  What about the underbelly of the beast with two backs? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  Look at you. Look at your fellow reference. Shakespeare. There you go. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=207.11999999999998s)]
*  Did you just volunteer to have a kid with Elon Musk? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=211.27999999999997s)]
*  I volunteer as tribute. It might take a few tries, but- [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  Like, Elon, they're not there because they wanna help you build a Legion. They're not there because [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=218.48s)]
*  they love you. They're not there because they like you. How could they? They're there for the money. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=223.44s)]
*  Lebowski. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=231.04s)]
*  I will. I don't know how, but I hope if anyone can do it, it's science genius Elon Musk. I [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=231.92s)]
*  volunteer to have you use me as your surrogate. I don't care. I will poop your baby out for [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=240.72s)]
*  $10 million. Brett, you are subjecting yourself potentially to the least satisfying [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  30 seconds and three and a half inches of your life. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  No, the problem is- [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=257.36s)]
*  But it is for $10 million. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=258.16s)]
*  It will take forever, because it takes him forever to say anything. That's why people [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=259.04s)]
*  think he's smart. He's like, maybe we can let a little Legion of Bothrake. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=262.88s)]
*  I like our declining birth rates a problem, like maybe in a generation for social security, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=271.44000000000005s)]
*  like- Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=280.88000000000005s)]
*  But then in the following generation, no, it's not. And there's more space and there's, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=281.92s)]
*  China seems to be doing fine with a declining birth rate. They were having trouble with an [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=287.36s)]
*  increasing birth rate and they took drastic action. My buddy Thanos is for the declining [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=292.96s)]
*  birth rate. But I just want to say, when we were saying they're weird, this is it. This is the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  weird thing. Yeah. Yeah, no, 100%. And weird, but also manipulative and corrupt. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=307.44s)]
*  And we'll get to that in a sec. I also just want to point out, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=315.67999999999995s)]
*  like I've been trying to convince people that he's not a genius. He's not just not a genius. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=318.4s)]
*  He's a dumb dumb. He's a legit dumb dumb. Let's say you think declining birth rates are bad. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=324.88s)]
*  Well, then I have to have more kids that has no relationship with it. A genius would know [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=330.88s)]
*  that doesn't do literally anything to solve the problem. That's 0.0001% of a societal problem. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=335.92s)]
*  It's so stupid, but even worse, it was revealed in this that he pressured St. Claire to have a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=342.32s)]
*  C-section because in his words, vaginal birth limits the size of the brain. And I know I want [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=348.88s)]
*  people to think about it for at least five seconds, which is more than he thought about it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=357.36s)]
*  He thinks that because of the evolutionary pressure of brain size and birth canal width or whatever, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=362.0s)]
*  meaning long term that there might be some sort of limit on the ability of the brain to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=368.48s)]
*  continue to evolve larger. No, he thinks the way it works is on an individual level. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=372.08s)]
*  If you go through the vagina, your brain will be smaller for the rest of your life. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=378.24s)]
*  It's dumber, I think, than anything I've ever seen a Louie Gohmert say, a Marjorie Green say, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=383.2s)]
*  and he believes it. He actually believes that he's one of the dumbest people in the world, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=390.56s)]
*  but also corrupt. Because he apparently saw Tiffany Wong is a cryptocurrency influencer [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=395.44s)]
*  on Twitter and he had the hots for her. So he did what you do. He DM'd her, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=402.56s)]
*  would you like me to impregnate you? They'd never met, just DM'd it. Okay, but it's weird when I do [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=407.44s)]
*  it because I'm not a billionaire or whatever. Get off my back. Anyway, they began interacting. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=414.0s)]
*  Okay, he'd like her posts, okay. And during the height of her interactions with Musk, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=419.12s)]
*  she earned apparently $21,000 in a two week period in November, which is crazy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=424.16s)]
*  Now it would seem to be because of added engagement because he's engaging with her. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=430.32000000000005s)]
*  I believe, no evidence, he juiced the system to get her engagement up so that she'd be excited [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=434.72s)]
*  to be affiliated with him. That is a weird way to refer to intercourse is juicing the system. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=440.48s)]
*  Anyway, so he sent her a direct message asking if she was interested in having his child. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=446.24s)]
*  Now she apparently wasn't interested because look at him. And she told St. Clair that she was worried [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=450.56s)]
*  about how rejecting Musk could affect her earnings on Twitter, which apparently they did. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=458.72s)]
*  Because he then chided her for not being discreet. As I said on TDR, he wants her to be discreet the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  way he is. DMing random women, do you want me to knock you up? That level of discretion. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=470.4s)]
*  So he unfollowed her. And according to the Wall Street Journal, that contributed to a fall in [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=475.84s)]
*  her engagement and her earnings declined. Yeah, maybe that's what it is. Or maybe in the same [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=481.35999999999996s)]
*  way that the owner of the platform can suddenly give her more money through forced engagement. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=487.2s)]
*  He can also shadow ban her if he wants to as punishment for not subjecting herself to his [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=493.35999999999996s)]
*  disgusting advances. Now again, I can't prove that, but I feel like he is certainly not above that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=499.44s)]
*  Any other thoughts? That is why most guys do what they do is so they can get girls. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=506.08s)]
*  Yeah. I hate to break it to you, that's it. From the peacock spreading its feathers to impress a mate, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=514.4s)]
*  so too doth the man learn guitar and the total dork get hair implants and start a PayPal. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=522.8s)]
*  Like that is what it's all about. The social network, basically this is their premise, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=531.44s)]
*  is that he wanted to get girls and he didn't know how to interact with them, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  whether that's true or not. That resonates with a lot of folks. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=542.96s)]
*  And I'm not the only one to say this, it's actually sadder than that. It's less carnal than that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=546.64s)]
*  And it's more like, please, please, please look at me. Please, please, please like me. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=555.5200000000001s)]
*  This is like the sex version. This is the relationship. Please let me touch you version of [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=561.12s)]
*  it. But there's a broader, more meta, everything he does is so that people will think he's funny [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=567.6s)]
*  and like him. It's so like- And he's not great at it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  And it makes people like him less. It makes fewer people like him. Now, the people that like him, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=579.6s)]
*  like him because they wanna be rich like him, not because they wanna have his personality. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=585.6s)]
*  You kidding me? My God. But what's funny is this guy owns companies that make rockets [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=591.04s)]
*  that land on chopsticks, and still he's hated by half the world. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=600.16s)]
*  Yeah. He doesn't realize this, but that was not enough for people to kind of think, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=605.2s)]
*  he's a smart guy and he has companies and we like him. And everyone was buying his stuff. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  And now he's got creepy and too much. You can't outrun who you are, your personality, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  and he is terrible. He bought companies with impressive people that work at it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=622.4s)]
*  And that's enough. If he wanted to, even now, I think, if he wanted to commit himself over the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  next 10 years to being the most beloved person in the world, he has the resources to do it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=633.12s)]
*  But he's not gonna do it because he's stupid and he's terrible. And so he's only going to be more [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=639.2s)]
*  unpopular a year from now and five years from now than he is right now. And maybe in an alternate [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=644.64s)]
*  reality where he'd been born via C-section, his brain would be bigger, that's the way it works, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=652.88s)]
*  then he could figure it out. But unfortunately, the vagina doomed him as it so often does. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=659.28s)]
*  Anyway, no, he's just, he's terrible. All of this is terrible. By the way, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=664.8s)]
*  damning, I understand this is the modern world. I have no problem with damning people, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=668.0s)]
*  but your first message shouldn't be, you want some sperm? That's not how it's supposed to go. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=671.76s)]
*  I know you've entered into relationships that began in that way. My now wife asked me to take [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  her to The Hobbit for our first date and she successfully in the Ali Wong style trapped me [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=684.48s)]
*  with that. She knew the way to get to me and that's fine. But the first thing had nothing to do with [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=690.24s)]
*  seminal fluids, just to be clear. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfzEzqIhynI&t=696.48s)]
