"A Mississippi judge ordered a newspaper to remove an editorial criticizing a mayor and city leaders after the officials sued, sparking complaints from press advocates that it violates the First Amendment.

Chancery Judge Crystal Wise Martin issued the restraining order against the Clarksdale Press Register on Tuesday in connection with a February 8 editorial titled ‚ÄúSecrecy, Deception Erode Public Trust.‚Äù The piece criticized the city for not sending the newspaper notice about a meeting the City Council held regarding a proposed tax on alcohol, marijuana and tobacco."

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Judge Makes SHOCKING Ruling Against Newspaper
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs)
*  A Mississippi judge is facing massive backlash after ordering a newspaper to remove an editorial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=0.0s)]
*  criticizing the mayor and city leaders after the officials sued. So the elected officials [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=9.84s)]
*  did not like the editorial, they pursue a lawsuit. Now free speech and press rights groups are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=17.36s)]
*  absolutely outraged and are speaking out about this controversial decision as they should be. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=22.88s)]
*  So here's what happened, let me give you the details. So chancery judge Crystal Wise Martin [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=29.44s)]
*  issued a restraining order against the Clarksdale Press Register on Tuesday in connection with a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=36.32s)]
*  February 8th editorial that was titled, Secrecy, Deception, Erode Public Trust. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so the piece specifically called out the city of Clarksdale, Mississippi for failing to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  send the newspaper notice about a meeting the city council held regarding a proposed tax increase. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=57.36s)]
*  So it was a proposed tax on alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, and they failed to basically notify the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=66.32s)]
*  paper and that allegedly violates a state law called the Open Meetings Act. You're supposed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=73.68s)]
*  to disclose this stuff, right? Obviously, we're talking about tax increases that are gonna impact [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=79.84s)]
*  people who live in this town. They deserve to know about any type of government meeting [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=84.32s)]
*  where they're going to adjudicate whether or not it makes sense to increase taxes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  Now according to the petition, city clerk Lakeitha Covington admitted she forgot to email a copy [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=94.16s)]
*  of the notice to publisher Floyd Ingram as she customarily does. The meeting in question lasted [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=101.44s)]
*  approximately two and a half minutes. The city commissioners voted unanimously to send a resolution [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=108.0s)]
*  seeking approval for the tax to the legislature. Now in response to the editorial slamming the city [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=114.08s)]
*  for not sending the notification for this meeting, Clarksdale sued and the city's lawsuit called the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=120.96s)]
*  editorial libelous and said it chilled and hindered the city's efforts to lobby for the tax with state [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=128.24s)]
*  legislators. I mean, and they broke the law. The public had the right to know about the meeting. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=136.32s)]
*  It's gonna be a little bit harder for the local politicians to get what they want from the state [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=148.72s)]
*  legislature. That's not a reason you violate the constitution. It's not even close. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=152.72s)]
*  So I don't know what this judge was thinking, but this case is really important. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=159.12s)]
*  Yeah. Because if they rule the wrong way here, it would allow any politician, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=162.96s)]
*  Democrat or Republican or Trump, to come in and go, well, there's a ruling there that says that if you [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  hurt my feelings- If you make my job harder to do. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=176.88s)]
*  Yeah, by what? What makes your job harder to do if you criticize it? That's it. If you criticize me, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  I get to shut it down and take the editorial down completely. That's a core first amendment [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=186.88s)]
*  violation, not close. There has to be a really strong ruling against this on appeal. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=192.8s)]
*  I agree. And by the way, congratulations, city officials, because now, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=199.52s)]
*  I think you're suffering from the Streisand effect. We're talking about this. This is something I [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  wouldn't have known anything about previously. Now Mayor Chuck Epsi said that the editorial [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=208.08s)]
*  unfairly implied that the city had broken the law with its meeting and cited another portion [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  that questioned have commissioners or the mayor gotten kickbacks from the community. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=218.88s)]
*  So the judge ended up siding with the city. And here's the argument from the judge in the decision [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=224.96s)]
*  that was made. The court finds that the petition is well taken. The injury in this case is defamation [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=230.88s)]
*  against public figures through actual malice in reckless disregard of the truth and interferes [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=239.2s)]
*  with their legitimate function to advocate for legislation they believe [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=246.16s)]
*  would help their municipality during this current legislative cycle. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=249.92s)]
*  First of all, proving actual malice is an incredibly difficult thing to do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=254.48s)]
*  How did this judge adjudicate that actual malice has taken place? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=259.68s)]
*  This is like I'm telling this is, okay, now I'm going to do the thing that the editorial did, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=263.92s)]
*  and then they can go ahead and try to shut all of YouTube down if they like. So is the judge [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=269.76000000000005s)]
*  somehow, does she know the mayor here? Something's going on. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=276.8s)]
*  Because this is insanity. Do you know that the paper wasn't at the hearing? They weren't given [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  a chance to defend themselves. Ironically, what happened was the paper didn't get noticed that the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=288.64s)]
*  initial hearing was happening, the local city council meeting, etc. Then when they get sued [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  about it, they didn't get noticed that they were supposed to be in court. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=300.88s)]
*  Yeah. And so she rules that they had actual malice, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=305.2s)]
*  when she didn't even hear their case. That's nuts. I mean, at a bare minimum, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=310.08s)]
*  that sounds like massive negligence. I'm sorry, have I criticized the public official? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=316.0s)]
*  So should I now be punished and my rights taken away from me? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=322.0s)]
*  No, that's not how this country works. We get to criticize them. Good news, Mr. Mayor, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=326.16s)]
*  you get to say your point of view. You're the mayor of the town. You get to scream it from the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=331.68s)]
*  rooftops. You have every microphone in the world within that town. So what do you mean? No, you're [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=336.48s)]
*  not. And again, what's the core charge? That maybe they were influenced by money. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=341.92s)]
*  You're going to ban anybody in media saying that politicians might be influenced by money? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=348.32s)]
*  By questioning whether that might be the case. It's literally not a statement of fact. It's not [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=352.88s)]
*  like they're stating something as fact that isn't fact. They're asking a legitimate question. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=360.24s)]
*  And by the way, I wanna give major props to an organization known as FIRE, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=365.6s)]
*  because they now do what the ACLU used to do in defending free speech rights. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=370.8s)]
*  I'm gonna go to graphic eight here. This is an attorney who works for [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=376.32s)]
*  the free speech organization FIRE. That's unconstitutional. In the United States, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=380.88s)]
*  the government can't determine what opinions may be shared in the public square. A free society [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=385.52s)]
*  does not permit governments to sue newspapers for publishing editorials. So the judge has [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=391.36s)]
*  scheduled a hearing on February 27th for this case, which the paper has promised they will fight. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=398.4s)]
*  Yes, and by the way, guys, I don't give a damn if they're Democrats or Republicans. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=406.64s)]
*  So you have to have principles that apply no matter which side it applies to. So in this case, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  who cares that they were Democrats and that Trump is a Republican? I don't care. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=422.32s)]
*  Neither one of them is allowed to say you can't publish materials that hurt my feelings or that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=431.2s)]
*  criticize me. And let alone, I mean, this is very similar to Elon Musk the other day, who said, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=437.92s)]
*  I didn't like 60 Minutes Report. I thought they were lying. My interpretation is that they were [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=443.2s)]
*  like, they should be arrested. That's even worse. No, First Amendment is for everyone, period. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqY_WqG0sIs&t=448.48s)]
