On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# DISASTER For Elon Musk During Trump Cabinet Meeting
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg)
*  Some Republicans who have been facing some heat, like Congressman Rich McCormick of Georgia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=0.0s)]
*  about these cuts, said he has some advice for Elon Musk. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=4.7s)]
*  If he just takes a half step back, we'll do something that I think can be compassionate. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=8.46s)]
*  At the same time, something that's impactful when it comes to saving America's money, it's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=15.9s)]
*  hard earned and hard spent. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=22.14s)]
*  What do you mean half step back? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=23.46s)]
*  He's admitted to things. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=24.78s)]
*  He said, look, we've done something wrong, but we're learning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=25.78s)]
*  You just watched Republican Representative Rich McCormick speak out against Elon Musk's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  leadership at Doge. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=35.38s)]
*  But if you thought that was a shot at Elon Musk, wait until you hear what Trump had to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  say to him today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=42.06s)]
*  The president wrote on Truth Social, Doge has been an incredible success. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=43.82s)]
*  And now that we have my cabinet in place, I've instructed the secretaries in leadership [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=48.72s)]
*  work with Doge on cost cutting measures and staffing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  As the secretaries learn about and understand the people working for the various departments, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  they can be very precise as to who will remain and who will go. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  We say the scalpel rather than the hatchet. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=65.28s)]
*  The combination of them, Elon, Doge, and other great people will be able to do things at [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=68.36s)]
*  a historic level. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=75.16s)]
*  And that post followed a cabinet meeting that seemed like it did not go well for Musk. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=77.52s)]
*  More Perfect Union reports, Trump told the cabinet today that they're in charge of their [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=82.66s)]
*  departments, not Elon Musk. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  According to two administration officials, Trump said that Musk can make recommendations, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=89.92s)]
*  but not issue unilateral decisions on staffing and policy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  Musk was also in the room. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=98.84s)]
*  So Cenk, do you think Elon is going to listen to Trump's instructions? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure he has a choice, but if he has a choice, then that means he really [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=105.8s)]
*  is the president. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=109.63999999999999s)]
*  So okay, we're going to discuss why they did this and what it could mean in a second. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=110.96s)]
*  But first, scalpel instead of a hatchet. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  I feel like I heard that somewhere before. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  Can you guys pull up where we might have heard that before? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=125.8s)]
*  What is not smart is, let's just fire everybody in the Department of Energy even though they [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=129.72s)]
*  work with nukes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=134.04s)]
*  And then see how it turns out. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=135.48s)]
*  That is super stupid. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=137.12s)]
*  Because guys, let's say I'm a right winger and I want to do this right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=139.52s)]
*  I wouldn't come in with a hatchet. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=142.96s)]
*  I would say scalpel rather than a hatchet. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=144.4s)]
*  Interesting, but I said that on the Young Turks. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=147.4s)]
*  I mean, if I said that on a right wing show, he might have heard it or in any collaboration [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=150.28s)]
*  at all. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=155.08s)]
*  Well, let's see what if something was said earlier this week. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=156.08s)]
*  Look, as you and I have talked about a little bit before, including on Merritt Street TV [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  earlier today. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  He's taking a machete when I think he should be taking a scalpel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  So I'm against waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=169.6s)]
*  We've been against it for 20 straight years. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=171.76s)]
*  I can't stand it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=173.76s)]
*  Subsidies going out the door usually to the donor class, whoever donates to Democrats [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  or Republicans, they get it back tenfold, 100 fold, etc. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=179.73999999999998s)]
*  But if we're cutting before we even see what we're cutting, then by definition to me, it [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=183.6s)]
*  can't be the right cuts. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=188.27999999999997s)]
*  We all agree with what you just said that we don't like fraud. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=189.92s)]
*  We don't like waste. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=196.0s)]
*  There's just bloat fat in government. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=198.56s)]
*  We all agree with that, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=201.16s)]
*  Nobody disagrees with that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=202.92s)]
*  Everybody agree that is that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=205.16s)]
*  Okay, and I raised my hand when I said I like Doge. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=207.56s)]
*  And I've been calling them out on some of the stuff that they're doing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=214.48s)]
*  You make a mistake if you, like you say, if you cut something like with veterans or you [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=217.6s)]
*  cut things with the elderly who need medications or whatever, then you find that you need to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=222.12s)]
*  put it back that day. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=229.0s)]
*  You don't need to say, okay, well, we'll study this for 60 days. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=230.6s)]
*  No, you put it back right now. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=233.88s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  And in another appearance we did on Mara TV together, Dr. Phil also said maybe a scalpel [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=239.64s)]
*  instead of a hatchet. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=244.94s)]
*  Look, Trump is now saying scalpel instead of hatchet. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  Look, am I saying that we unilaterally, of course, we didn't just, okay, Trump listened [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=249.52s)]
*  to the Young Turks or Barrett Street TV and that's how he got it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=254.44s)]
*  But guys, you put it into the zeitgeist and you do it in a way that actually echoes throughout [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=257.88s)]
*  the entire media ecosystem. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=263.08s)]
*  And most importantly, of course, it's gonna get to the polls and why that happened in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=266.28s)]
*  a second. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=270.52s)]
*  But then all of a sudden, he's even using the same exact words we used. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=271.68s)]
*  So do I know that that bounced into his ear? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=276.28s)]
*  Maybe, but overall, the most important thing is when he got unpopular, all of a sudden, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=279.0s)]
*  he's walking it back. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=285.28s)]
*  By the way, also like we told you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=286.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Trump has been known to govern and do things based on what he sees on TV. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=288.88s)]
*  So it's not the craziest idea. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=294.94s)]
*  But let's get into what Americans think about Doge right now. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=297.44s)]
*  Apparently, there are mixed feelings. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=300.2s)]
*  A recent poll by Generation Lab found that young Americans are not picking up what Doge [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=302.4s)]
*  is putting down. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=307.64s)]
*  87% of 18 to 34 year olds say they've heard a lot or a little about Doge and 71% say they [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  strongly or somewhat disapprove of the agency's work so far. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=317.64s)]
*  68% of young Republicans unsurprisingly approve of Doge's work compared with 9% of Democrats [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=323.0s)]
*  and 29% of independents. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=329.92s)]
*  On the other hand, some recent polls are showing that Americans approve of Doge's cuts and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  Musk's involvement with the agency. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=337.12s)]
*  Let's watch Harry Enton break down the numbers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=339.98s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=342.56s)]
*  This to me was one of the more shocking figures that I saw. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=344.2s)]
*  Made me go, wait a minute, hold on one second. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=347.44s)]
*  Whoa, Americans on Trump and Joe's efforts. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=350.08s)]
*  Musk and Doge should influence government spending and operations. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=352.64s)]
*  Look at this, 54%. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=355.84s)]
*  The majority say that he and they should. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=357.52s)]
*  How about approve of Trump trying to cut staff at government agencies? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=360.24s)]
*  Again, you get a majority here, 51%. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=362.96s)]
*  Democrats wanna argue that the type of spending that Musk is cutting is mainly necessary programs. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  But that comes in at just 36%. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=371.2s)]
*  The wasteful spending actually wins the plurality here at 42%, according to a recent Washington [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=373.08s)]

*  Well, yesterday, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that it would be letting [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=383.32s)]
*  go about 15% of its workforce. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=386.7s)]
*  That's approximately 80,000 employees. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=389.53999999999996s)]
*  After the cuts, the department would have about the same number of workers it did in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=393.97999999999996s)]

*  By making the VA workforce more efficient, President Trump and Secretary Collins will [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=411.34s)]

*  the benefits they earned. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=421.46s)]
*  The VA had also announced that they would be canceling 875 contracts, but they later [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=423.62s)]
*  backtracked and lowered that number to 585. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=429.42s)]

*  Some of these things that they're planning on cutting doesn't seem like they fall into [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=491.94000000000005s)]
*  those categories. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=494.98s)]
*  Well, as we've talked about in the past, they also cut billions from cancer research. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=496.14000000000004s)]
*  They cut money to get the lead out of the pipes that gives brain damage to children. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=499.90000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, not just in Democratic areas, although that would already be atrocious, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=505.62s)]
*  but in Republican areas and all areas, because corporations are now totally in charge. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=509.78000000000003s)]
*  Anything that caused them ascent, they're against it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=514.1800000000001s)]
*  So they'll cut, cut, cut. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=516.58s)]
*  That's the actual point of this. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=518.38s)]
*  So why are they now walking it back? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=520.02s)]
*  Number one, they've started to see Elon's poll numbers overall drop. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=522.9s)]
*  We've showed that to you in other shows. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=527.02s)]
*  Doja's support in polling, we've shown in other shows that dropping. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=528.86s)]
*  The town halls that the Republicans are dealing with. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=534.5799999999999s)]
*  And most importantly, guys, nothing actually moves until the Republicans' specific poll [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=537.5s)]
*  numbers move. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=543.02s)]
*  So now I guarantee you that they're taking polls in purple districts and purple states. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=544.36s)]
*  And Republican congressmen are getting back numbers going, whoa, what happened to my polling [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=550.0s)]
*  here? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=554.76s)]
*  It looks like people don't like it when we randomly fire a whole bunch of people. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=555.76s)]
*  And they said they weren't going to do Project 2025. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=560.0s)]
*  They come in and immediately do Project 2025. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=562.0400000000001s)]
*  Not only did people not vote for this, you promised them that you wouldn't do this to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=564.64s)]
*  get their vote, right? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=569.12s)]
*  So now you're chopping away. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=570.84s)]
*  And look at how stupid this is. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  You're going to cut Veterans Affairs by 80,000 people so that veterans are served less, let [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=573.84s)]
*  alone the people who were fired, but the veterans will get less service. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't know a dumber cut than that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  That's so dumb that it makes me think Democratic leadership would have come up with something [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=584.3599999999999s)]
*  like that, right? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=588.12s)]
*  So punch yourself in the face for no reason. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=589.4799999999999s)]
*  Good to see that the Republicans are now as strategically stupid as Democratic leadership [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=591.56s)]
*  is. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=595.92s)]
*  So in this case, now speaking of the Democrats, what should they do? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=596.92s)]
*  So there's a couple of different schools of thought and I have a completely different [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=600.16s)]
*  one. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=604.4s)]
*  One school of thought is yell at them about everything. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=605.4s)]
*  So you're going to cut waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=607.36s)]
*  Boo, don't cut anything. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=609.88s)]
*  Super dumb, everybody hates waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=612.48s)]
*  Don't be opposed to that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=616.0s)]
*  Okay, so then there's a second school of thought. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=617.4s)]
*  Democrats like James Carville, Hakeem Jeffries, etc. say, just do nothing, just sit on our [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=620.16s)]
*  ass and wait for them to punch themselves out by doing things like this that are going [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=624.64s)]
*  to get them unpopular. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=630.12s)]
*  Wow, profile and courage. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=631.64s)]
*  Okay, let me give you another alternative. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=633.88s)]
*  Why don't Democratic leaderships, why don't they come out, again press conferences, go [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=638.4s)]
*  on television, go on the podcast and say, waste, fraud and abuse, glad you asked. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=642.2800000000001s)]
*  Okay, here are the 12 programs we have found that are horrifically fraudulent, abusive [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  and wasteful. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=654.0s)]
*  So for example, did you know that oil companies get $30 billion in subsidies? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=655.0s)]
*  That's taken straight out of the pockets of the average American to pay to the richest [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=659.1600000000001s)]
*  executives in the country. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=663.68s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=665.16s)]
*  And let me show you the chart of where Exxon Mobil, Chevron and all these companies are. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=666.16s)]
*  They're all top 20 companies in the world. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=670.4799999999999s)]
*  Why do they need Joe's money in Kansas? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=672.4799999999999s)]
*  Joe's barely surviving. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=675.92s)]
*  He's going paycheck to paycheck and you want him to pay Exxon Mobil? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=678.52s)]
*  I found the waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=682.04s)]
*  Let's go get those sons of bitches. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=683.76s)]
*  Elon, you in? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=685.2399999999999s)]
*  You in? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=686.2399999999999s)]
*  Pentagon can't pass an audit. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=687.2399999999999s)]
*  Here's program one, program two, program three. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=688.8s)]
*  Let's get rid of these sons of bitches. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=691.68s)]
*  Democrats, do something. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=693.84s)]
*  Take the waste, fraud and abuse that is popular and say we're doing it and juxtapose it to [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=697.56s)]
*  the Republicans. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=703.84s)]
*  So we're showing you, here's the actual waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=705.12s)]
*  Whereas Elon goes, I just came in and cut everything. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=708.88s)]
*  I'm so good at this. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=712.08s)]
*  I cut all the veterans. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=713.64s)]
*  Are you brother, are you? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=716.0s)]
*  Because all of a sudden you're taking your ass to the back row, aren't you? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=717.56s)]
*  Because it turns out that American people didn't sign up for this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=721.08s)]
*  And by the way, here, let me do a little rub it in your face for the MAGA guys, okay? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=723.4000000000001s)]
*  So everybody's in a bubble. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=728.32s)]
*  And I tell the Democrats that Joe Biden's older, like you're crazy, he's not old. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=730.08s)]
*  I tell the Republicans, hey, you know what? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  Super dumb cuts where you blindly hatchet people and fire people. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=737.0s)]
*  And the main message you send out to people is, we fire everyone without even thinking [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=742.22s)]
*  about it. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=746.48s)]
*  We hate the average American, we fire them right away. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=747.48s)]
*  Mike, that is gonna be a super unpopular position. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=749.96s)]
*  Have at it, Hoss. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=752.32s)]
*  You don't know what you're doing. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=753.32s)]
*  No way, man. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=754.48s)]
*  The country voted for us to totally butcher the government and destroy all these departments [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=755.48s)]
*  and cut these jobs. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=760.16s)]
*  Did they? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=762.2s)]
*  And that look like it now, does it? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=763.2s)]
*  Okay, so there you go. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=765.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's a fundamental misunderstanding, I think, from a lot of people who are cheering [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=766.64s)]
*  this on about what that's going to look like and the effects beyond just a downsizing of [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=770.2s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=777.24s)]
*  I mean, when you're talking about just from one department, 80,000 people potentially [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=778.24s)]
*  and suddenly being out of work. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=783.28s)]
*  And now spread that across the federal government, and it's not just in DC, it's around the country. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=785.28s)]
*  You're going to see jobless claims rise. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=789.72s)]
*  You're going to see spending in their community decline. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=792.16s)]
*  Especially in cities like DC, you're having emergency job fairs for all these people who [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=796.24s)]
*  are suddenly out of work. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=800.84s)]
*  Career bureaucrats who, while the Republicans may stigmatize them, have largely thankless [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=802.36s)]
*  and apolitical jobs that help keep the government going. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=807.5s)]
*  And when you talk about efficiency and services, when you're cutting the VA, the more people [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=810.7s)]
*  you have to process these claims and deliver care, the better. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=814.5s)]
*  It will be interesting to see if people can make that connection between what we're now [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=818.94s)]

*  You're going to see a shrinking or contraction of the economy. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=835.46s)]
*  People will not have as much disposable income to spend in their communities that will affect [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=839.1600000000001s)]

*  And the Democrats don't really seem capable of talking about, painting a picture of, explaining [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=851.0600000000001s)]

*  And Jen, to your point, when you're talking about cuts to oil subsidies, that's great. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=859.38s)]
*  I'd love to see corn subsidies. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=864.62s)]
*  The way, if you really want to make America healthy again, one easy way you can do it [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=867.5400000000001s)]
*  is go after corn and how it's in everything from high fructose corn syrup to corn starch [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=872.22s)]

*  It is so bad for you. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=877.38s)]
*  Go after that, but they don't care. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=879.26s)]
*  They're not really worried about that. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=882.0600000000001s)]
*  And then in the joint address, you want to talk about wasteful spending, an iron dome [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=883.86s)]
*  for the US? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=888.58s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=889.58s)]
*  That's a massive giveaway to the defense contractors and weapons manufacturers. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=890.58s)]
*  We don't have a need for that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=895.38s)]
*  And it is just another way that they can further enrich the military industrial complex. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=896.86s)]
*  Yeah, so high fructose corn syrup. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=902.22s)]
*  Yes, on Tuesday earlier this week, when we did the joint coverage with Merit Street TV, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=905.6600000000001s)]
*  that's Dr. Phil's network. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=911.38s)]
*  We both talked about high fructose corn syrup and how it was a disaster. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  In fact, Secretary Kennedy came on the show and we asked, hey, are you going to do those [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=919.58s)]
*  things? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=925.9000000000001s)]
*  Then I also asked, hey, if you don't negotiate drug prices in Medicare, will you have failed? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=926.9000000000001s)]
*  And it was an interesting answer. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=932.74s)]
*  He said, if we don't lower drug prices, we'll have failed. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=934.86s)]
*  So you're not going to negotiate. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=939.5400000000001s)]
*  You're just going to pretend you lowered some drug prices. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=942.46s)]
*  Interesting, right? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=945.1400000000001s)]
*  But the one thing that he is supposed to, if Bobby Kennedy Jr. doesn't do anything about [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=947.38s)]
*  high fructose corn syrup, well, then he never meant anything, anything. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=951.42s)]
*  I get why the Medicare drug prices, that's just Washington, Trump, all of the Republicans [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=956.86s)]
*  in Congress, all the Democrats in Congress, they're all so corrupt. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=962.86s)]
*  They're just, okay, I couldn't move that corrupt mountain. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=966.82s)]
*  But first of all, you should be honest about it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=969.64s)]
*  Of course, they won't be. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=970.78s)]
*  Instead, they'll take the same money from the same companies, do the same thing. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=971.78s)]
*  But if he doesn't even do high fructose corn syrup, then he wasn't going to do anything [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=975.66s)]
*  at all. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=978.66s)]
*  It was all just them and make America healthy again was total nonsense. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=979.66s)]
*  But hold on, the jury's out on that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=983.2199999999999s)]
*  But the reason I brought it up is because we had a town hall, mixed audience, but lean [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=984.86s)]
*  Republican. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=990.66s)]
*  They all agreed. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=992.3399999999999s)]
*  Again, why? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=993.3399999999999s)]
*  Why do we have this junk in our food? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=994.3399999999999s)]
*  It's so much worse for us than sugar. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=996.9399999999999s)]
*  And you want to know why? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=998.66s)]
*  Corn subsidies, 100% because of the corn subsidies. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=999.66s)]
*  So why don't we go tackle that? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1003.72s)]
*  Okay, so please, let's be productive. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1005.6s)]
*  And so look, do you see any other show telling you what the Democrats should actually do? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1008.88s)]
*  Being constructive. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1013.6s)]
*  Here's the strategy, the high fructose corn syrup, the oil subsidies, and we can list [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1014.9200000000001s)]
*  you 20 others. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1018.76s)]
*  Isn't it amazing that the Democrats haven't figured out one of those strategies yet? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1020.6s)]
*  Jesus, man. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1025.24s)]
*  We need to just take over the Democratic Party because these guys are never gonna do it right. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1027.48s)]
*  Have you thought about running for office? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1032.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1033.6s)]
*  Don't get me started, brother. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtCXf1AOXg&t=1034.6s)]
