"SACRAMENTO, California ‚Äî Gov. Gavin Newsom is making sure California‚Äôs business elite can call him, maybe.

Roughly 100 leaders of state-headquartered companies have received a curious package in recent months: a prepaid, inexpensive cell phone (commonly known as a burner, for those of you who haven‚Äôt seen ‚ÄúThe Wire‚Äù or ‚ÄúBetter Call Saul‚Äù), programmed with Newsom‚Äôs digits and accompanied by notes from the governor himself."

# Gavin Newsom Sketchiest Move Yet
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY)
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom is trying to make it as clear as possible, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=0.0s)]
*  as clear as humanly possible to the wealthy tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=5.44s)]
*  that he will do their bidding. And for some reason, he's doing it in the sketchiest way possible. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=10.0s)]
*  He's giving them burner phones, burner phones, the kind of phones that criminals like to use. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=16.64s)]
*  He wants to give them direct access to the governor in a way that journalists would not be able to pry [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=23.52s)]
*  into the communications of. Really fascinating stuff here. So as political reports, roughly [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  100 leaders of state headquartered companies have received a curious package in recent months, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=36.8s)]
*  a prepaid, inexpensive cell phone, commonly known as a burner, programmed with Newsom's digits and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=44.32s)]
*  accompanied by notes from the governor himself. If you ever need anything, I'm a phone call away, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=51.68s)]
*  read one note to a prominent tech firm CEO printed on official letterhead, along with a hand-scrawled [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=59.44s)]
*  addendum urging the executive to reach out. And guess what? This was perceived as so sketchy [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=66.56s)]
*  that some people in the tech industry were skeptical and even had security concerns when [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=74.4s)]
*  they first received the burner phones. But according to a Newsom representative, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=80.56s)]
*  the burner initiative was his idea. Wow, what a shocker. I would have never believed that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=85.28s)]
*  Of course it was his idea. He is a sketchy guy. I've known this for a long time, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=89.84s)]
*  so I'm not really that surprised about it. But apparently, the burner phone initiative was his [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=94.4s)]
*  idea and has already yielded some valuable interactions. But John, we're not really [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  gonna know about those interactions, are we? Because since these are burner phones paid for [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=105.76s)]
*  by a nonprofit, not through taxpayer money, well, it doesn't necessarily have to be revealed to the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=111.44s)]
*  public or to journalists as part of a FOIA request. If he was sending emails through [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=120.56s)]
*  official channels, if he was making phone calls through his office, that's a different story. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=126.64s)]
*  But since these are burner phones that are privately funded, well, he gets to engage in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=131.6s)]
*  whatever he wants to engage with or say whatever he wants to say through these conversations on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=137.6s)]
*  these burner phones without disclosure. Yeah, I think it's a reminder that there [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=143.44s)]
*  are very different standards for us and for the elites. He sends burner phones to the CEOs, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=149.92s)]
*  and it's totally cool. I send them to female fans. I have to have a long talk with my wife. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=155.04s)]
*  The world's just not fair, and I think we're reminded of that on a daily basis, thanks to the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=159.84s)]
*  news. I'm kidding, obviously. I think that this is such a sketchy thing to do that the only [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=163.04s)]
*  explanation that makes sense is that Gavin Newsom is secretly a big fan of you, Anna. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=169.28s)]
*  And he just wants to make sure that you have content to discuss. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=174.08s)]
*  Because the second I saw this headline, I was like, there's no way she's not covering this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=178.16s)]
*  He's such a target rich environment. And you know what? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=182.4s)]
*  I'm gonna say it. I'm so happy that he interviewed Charlie Kirk and said he was a huge fan of his. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=188.48s)]
*  I'm so happy he interviewed Steve Bannon. Not because I thought he did a good job in those [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=194.24s)]
*  interviews. I actually agree with the critics and how he handled those conversations. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=199.28s)]
*  But because finally, finally, Democratic voters have woken up to the fact that Gavin Newsom [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=203.44s)]
*  is not a good guy. He's a bad guy. And it's not merely because he had those conversations [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  with odious individuals. It's specifically because of other things that he has done [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  that have flew under the radar because he's got great hair and veneers that are honestly [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  too white for his face, okay? That's the reality. He's so hot because in the world of politicians, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=229.84s)]
*  there's a super low bar and anyone who's not grotesque to look at is considered hot. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=236.72s)]
*  That's what we're dealing with, right? It's just so pathetic. I hate Gavin Newsom. He is sketchy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=242.72s)]
*  He is scummy. He is a crook, okay? And this is yet another example of what's going on here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=248.72s)]
*  Those are my opinions, all right? So Newsom has long been considered more friendly to the Silicon [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=254.64s)]
*  Valley Titans than the rest of the California legislature. Politico notoriously describes him [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=260.88s)]
*  as the proverbial adult in the room when private pillars like Silicon Valley need a sympathetic ear [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=266.64s)]
*  or a veto. He's their boy. He's their boy. Look out for you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=275.12s)]
*  ‚Äî That's my favorite thing about the story is I just imagine these CEOs, they get this thing, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  they open it up. It's a burner phone, official letterhead. You can call me. And then in a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=287.52s)]
*  needlessly thirsty edition, he handwrites, no, seriously, you can call me. I'm right here. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=293.36s)]
*  And the tech CEOs are probably like, yeah, no, we know, dude. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=298.64s)]
*  We knew that we could get anything we want out of you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  ‚Äî Exactly, yeah. ‚Äî Yeah, so look, he's doing all of this maneuvering [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=304.8s)]
*  for the next presidential election. That's what he's doing. And what has he done? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=309.68s)]
*  He's done two things. He sat down with some of the most grotesque people in the country, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=313.6s)]
*  and he's cozied up even more to wealthy business interests. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  Is he sitting down with progressives on his podcast? Is he sending burner phones to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=324.72s)]
*  environmental groups? Call me anytime you need anything. He is showing what he values. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=329.6s)]
*  And also, he's showing a complete inability to learn any lessons from the past few presidential [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=336.24s)]
*  elections. Politically, tack to the center, try to appeal to some of the right-wing identity [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=342.32000000000005s)]
*  politics, culture war nonsense or whatever, and maybe raise even more money. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=347.28s)]
*  Because that's the only thing stopping a Democrat from winning is if we raise $1.7 billion, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=351.76s)]
*  then we can definitely win without appealing to any actual voters. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=357.76s)]
*  And so all this is super depressing in a time when we're not exactly [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=360.88s)]
*  going hungry for stuff that can inspire depression. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=364.0s)]
*  ‚Äî Yeah, I mean, he has screwed over victims of wildfires that were sparked as a result of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=366.4s)]
*  utility companies, some of his biggest donors. PG&E is one of his biggest donors. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=374.0s)]
*  He screwed those fire victims over, essentially ensuring that the structure of their compensation [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=379.44s)]
*  would be in the form of shares of stock for PG&E. So these fire victims are literally forced to cheer [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=385.92s)]
*  for the financial success and profit motive of the very utility company that couldn't be bothered to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=393.68s)]
*  replace a $10 hook to keep power lines suspended so they don't fall onto dry brush and spark a fire. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=399.6s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened in 2018, causing the deadliest fire in California's history. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=408.0s)]
*  That's who Gavin Newsom is. So who's paying for all of this? As I mentioned, it's not taxpayers, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  which allows for these communications to occur without the typical reporting requirements. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=417.68s)]
*  The California Protocol Foundation picked up the tab. That organization gets money from businesses [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=425.44s)]
*  and other nonprofits for gubernatorial expenses like trips abroad or evidently, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=431.92s)]
*  evidently burner phones, so taxpayers aren't on the hook. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=438.32s)]
*  It also drew leftover funds from Newsom's inauguration account. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=441.6s)]
*  But again, this isn't really about like, ooh, Newsom doesn't want to waste taxpayer money. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  He's the king of squandering taxpayer money in the state of California. He squandered $24 billion [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=451.04s)]
*  that was meant to go to the homeless, but it didn't go to the homeless. It went to nonprofits [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=459.04s)]
*  that padded their own pockets with that money. And it's absolutely disgusting [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=464.72s)]
*  that taxpayers got robbed, that homeless people in need of that money and those resources got robbed. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=468.88s)]
*  That's who Gavin Newsom is. The reason why this was funded through a nonprofit [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=474.16s)]
*  is because he doesn't want those communications to be reported [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=478.4s)]
*  because they don't fall under the types of communications that FOIA requests would [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=482.0s)]
*  force him to release to the public. Law professor and lobbyist Chris Michelli [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=488.4s)]
*  says that the state's public records laws overwhelmingly block the governor's communications [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=496.0s)]
*  from public view. Only if the governor chose to publicize that or who called and what was said [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  in such a phone call. Otherwise, no, those are exempt from public disclosure. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=508.16s)]
*  And the bizarre move was immediately called out by Republicans in California, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=513.52s)]
*  obviously for political reasons. But Assembly Republican minority leader [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  James Gallagher posted this on X. The governor says he's just being more responsive. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=523.84s)]
*  I mean, nothing shows transparency and openness more than a burner phone. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=529.28s)]
*  Totally on the up and up. Then again, maybe he just wants a heads up before they leave town. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=534.0s)]
*  So look, you'll be shocked to learn that tech companies and their billionaire chief executives [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  have been some of the most generous donors to Gavin Newsom's campaign. Let's go to the next [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=547.0400000000001s)]
*  graphic. More than half a dozen tech executives and investors gave more than $100,000 each to [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu9phx83GY&t=552.48s)]
