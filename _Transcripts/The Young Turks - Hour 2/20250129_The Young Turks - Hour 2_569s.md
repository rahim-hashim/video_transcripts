"Former New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was sentenced Wednesday to 11 years in prison following his conviction on bribery and corruption charges after taking cash, a Mercedes Benz and gold bars as bribes in exchange for helping three businessmen and the Egyptian government.

The sentencing marks a dramatic fall for the lawmaker born to Cuban emigres who got his start in politics in Union City, New Jersey, and became one of the most powerful senators as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Menendez was convicted last year of 16 felony counts for the long-running corruption scheme, making him the first US senator charged and convicted of acting as an agent of a foreign government."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Former Senator Bob Menendez Sentenced To 11 Years In Prison
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI)
*  Today, former Democratic Senator [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=0.0s)]
*  Bob Menendez was sentenced to 11 [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=2.6s)]
*  years in prison for levels of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=5.14s)]
*  corruption that can only be [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=7.34s)]
*  described as cartoonish. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=9.46s)]
*  So now he's the first public [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=11.58s)]
*  official in American history to be [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=13.6s)]
*  convicted of acting as a foreign [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=16.1s)]
*  agent. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=18.54s)]
*  And I want to note, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=19.84s)]
*  he's 71 years old and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=21.06s)]
*  he just got sentenced to 11 years [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=22.38s)]
*  behind bars. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=24.34s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to see [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=26.98s)]
*  him today outside of prison after [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=28.8s)]
*  he reports to serve this 11 year [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=31.220000000000002s)]
*  sentence. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=33.6s)]
*  Now last year Menendez was [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=35.58s)]
*  convicted of all charges brought [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  against him, which totaled 16 [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=39.04s)]
*  felony convictions for bribery, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=40.96s)]
*  extortion, conspiracy, honest [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  services, wire fraud, which I've [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=45.3s)]
*  never heard of but bad, obstruction [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=47.58s)]
*  of justice, and acting as a foreign [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  agent while holding public office. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=52.36s)]
*  And we covered this story from [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=54.56s)]
*  the very beginning, but [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=56.32s)]
*  in case you missed our coverage, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=57.86000000000001s)]
*  let me give you the details about [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=59.7s)]
*  what he was tried and convicted for. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=61.56s)]
*  So the charges revolved around [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  Menendez's relationship with [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=65.3s)]
*  the government of Egypt as well as [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=67.42s)]
*  three businessmen, Wael Hannah, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=69.72s)]
*  Jose Uribe, and Fred Davies. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=72.34s)]
*  So here's former US attorney [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  Damian Williams explaining more [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=78.82000000000001s)]
*  about what Menendez was tried and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=81.18s)]
*  then later convicted of. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=83.62s)]
*  The indictment alleges that Senator [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=85.44s)]
*  Menendez used his power and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=87.34s)]
*  influence, including his leadership [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=88.92s)]

*  Among other actions, Senator [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=97.48s)]

*  information to Egyptian officials. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=103.64s)]
*  We also allege that Senator [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=106.16s)]
*  Menendez improperly pressured [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=107.6s)]

*  ways. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  First, by seeking to install a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=149.54s)]
*  United States attorney who he [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=151.66s)]
*  thought could be influenced with [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=153.74s)]
*  respect to Davies. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=156.1s)]
*  And second, by trying to influence [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=157.54s)]
*  that office to act favorably in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=159.74s)]
*  Davies case. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=161.7s)]
*  Okay, so that is what he has now [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=162.42s)]

*  And look, when we talk about [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=167.14s)]
*  corruption, we're talking about [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  corruption at cartoonish levels. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=171.52s)]
*  We're not joking, because get a load [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=174.08s)]
*  of the ludicrous bribes that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=176.72s)]
*  Menendez received. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=178.8s)]
*  Special agents with the FBI [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=182.52s)]
*  executed search warrants on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=184.0s)]

*  of Senator Menendez and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=187.72s)]
*  Nadine Menendez in New Jersey. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=189.08s)]
*  When they got there, they [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=191.68s)]
*  discovered approximately $500,000 [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=193.28s)]
*  of cash stuffed into envelopes and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=195.84s)]
*  closets. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=198.0s)]
*  Some of the cash was stuffed in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=199.72s)]
*  Senator's jacket pockets. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  Some of the cash, some of the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  envelopes of cash contain Davies [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=205.06s)]
*  fingerprints, Davies DNA. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=206.94s)]
*  That's not all. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=209.78s)]
*  Agents also discovered a lot of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=211.22s)]
*  gold, gold that was provided by [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=213.58s)]
*  Davies and Hanna. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=215.94s)]
*  And the FBI, of course, found [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=218.46s)]
*  the Mercedes-Benz that your eBay [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  had provided them. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=221.94s)]
*  I mean, Menendez and his wife even [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=225.02s)]
*  accepted luxury vehicles. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=227.74s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=230.36s)]
*  Now when the charges were first [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=231.72s)]
*  announced back in 2023, Menendez [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=233.48s)]
*  responded by brazenly weaponizing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=235.48s)]
*  his identity. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=237.72s)]
*  But it's also hilarious that he [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=239.68s)]
*  said this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=241.38s)]
*  He said, those behind this campaign [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5dYe5eBdI&t=242.04s)]
