"Fox News host Bret Baier tried to console Fox Business host and former Trump official Larry Kudlow on Tuesday after it was reported that President Donald Trump was considering tax hikes on the wealthy.

‚ÄúOn this tax day, all kinds of stuff floating out there,‚Äù said Baier during an interview with Kudlow. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the makings of this bill yet, but there‚Äôs all kinds of trial balloons going out that the top tier could be tax increase, there could be a raise in the business corporate tax. Is that real?‚Äù"

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network.

# Larry Kudlow CRASHES OUT Live On Fox
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw)
*  I thought it was the Republicans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=0.0s)]
*  that wanted lower taxes and [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=2.04s)]
*  the Democrats that wanted higher [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=3.84s)]
*  taxes, although I guess that's not [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=5.88s)]
*  always true. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=7.94s)]
*  I thought the Republicans wanted [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=8.72s)]
*  to reward success, not punishing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=13.42s)]
*  This loose talk about a higher top [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=13.92s)]
*  another new bracket for millionaires, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=16.16s)]
*  I don't think it's a crime to be [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=18.8s)]
*  a millionaire by the way, small [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=20.6s)]
*  businesses would pay this top [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=22.52s)]
*  bracket. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=24.28s)]
*  I do not understand this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=25.0s)]
*  I can't believe Mr. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=26.8s)]
*  Trump's going to go along with this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=27.84s)]
*  I don't understand and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  I can't believe what I'm hearing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=30.84s)]
*  It's giving me a headache. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=33.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=34.36s)]
*  Tax day should be tax cut day. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=34.86s)]
*  We'll get you some Advil. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=36.44s)]
*  That was yesterday with [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  Larry Kudlow almost dying. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=41.3s)]
*  He was so shocked to find out that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  Republicans might raise taxes on [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=45.2s)]
*  the highest earners, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=47.28s)]
*  the wealthiest Americans. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=48.72s)]
*  But is that a real possibility? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  No, but we're going to go through [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=53.96s)]
*  the various Republicans that are [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=55.64s)]
*  pretending briefly that it will be [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  taxed so that people don't know [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=59.4s)]
*  that the entire point of electing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=61.08s)]
*  a Republican president is to hand [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=62.72s)]
*  $5 to $10 trillion to the wealthiest [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=64.32s)]
*  people in America. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=66.12s)]
*  If you only learn one lesson about [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=67.04s)]
*  American politics, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=68.92s)]
*  please let it be that one. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=70.08s)]
*  But no, they're going to pretend [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=71.56s)]
*  that they might raise taxes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=73.24s)]
*  So last week, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=74.92s)]
*  Semaphore reported that Trump told [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=75.88s)]
*  Republican senators he's open to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=78.12s)]
*  raising taxes on highest earners. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=80.2s)]
*  And look, I don't even doubt that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=82.48s)]
*  he said that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=84.52s)]
*  Because you know why? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=85.84s)]
*  He says lots of things that are [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  true, but might be popular. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=89.27999999999999s)]
*  Semaphore, could you catch up on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  the last 50 years of Donald Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  and what he does? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=97.0s)]
*  He's not honest, okay? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=98.55999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, according to the report, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham asked Trump [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=102.32s)]
*  if he would be okay with letting [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  taxes increase on the rich rather [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  than including them in the massive [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=106.56s)]
*  tax cuts that Republicans want to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  pass. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  Because obviously Lindsey Graham [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=110.0s)]
*  has also always been a crusader for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  a more equitable and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  fair tax system. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  The president replied that he'd be [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  fine with the idea. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=117.8s)]
*  According to three people, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=118.48s)]
*  they told Semaphore that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=119.76s)]
*  Okay, so Lindsey Graham's on board [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=121.08s)]
*  and Trump is on board. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=123.2s)]
*  But what about [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=125.64s)]
*  congressional Republicans? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  Will they actually do this? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=127.16s)]
*  Well, last week, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=128.08s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson stated [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=129.0s)]
*  that Republicans are generally [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=130.8s)]
*  trying to cut taxes, which yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=132.56s)]
*  And Andy Harris of the House [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=135.44s)]
*  Freedom Caucus, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=137.4s)]
*  he's the chair of it, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=138.72s)]
*  told Semaphore that he would [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=140.12s)]
*  support higher taxes for [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  the wealthy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=143.6s)]
*  And we'll see about that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=144.4s)]
*  He said, if we slightly increase [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=145.2s)]
*  the rate on the highest earners or [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  create a million dollar earner [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=148.84s)]
*  bracket that's a little bit higher [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=150.56s)]
*  than the current highest level, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  which caps out far below $1 million, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=153.88s)]
*  I'd be okay with that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=155.72s)]
*  Okay, that's interesting and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  he's on the record. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=158.56s)]
*  It's a specific quote to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  a specific outlet. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  Still don't believe it, but [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=162.16s)]
*  at least he's being specific. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=163.2s)]
*  Senator Josh Hawley, who has [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=164.56s)]
*  occasionally split with Trump or [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=166.32s)]
*  the other Republicans on a few [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  things, admittedly. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=170.12s)]
*  He stated that higher taxes on [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  the rich could be in play, though [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  for the time being, he's primarily [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=174.6s)]
*  on a child tax credit. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=176.68s)]
*  He said, my colleagues and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=177.96s)]
*  I go around on this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=179.08s)]
*  Their usual line on tax cuts is, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=180.0s)]
*  we don't need to offset tax cuts. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  But anytime I bring up [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=183.68s)]
*  the child tax credit, they're like, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=184.44000000000003s)]
*  well, we need to offset that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=185.8s)]
*  If the White House wants to offset [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=187.56s)]
*  that with a surcharge on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=188.96s)]
*  billionaires, that's fine with me. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=189.96s)]
*  But I might be in the minority of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  my party, yeah, you might be. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=193.52s)]
*  And I like the strategy, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=196.08s)]
*  they work on the tax cuts. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=197.4s)]
*  He works on the child tax credit, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=199.12s)]
*  that way they can pass the tax cuts [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=200.96s)]
*  and then kill the tax credit. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  And that's basically what's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  actually going to happen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=205.72s)]
*  And some in leadership are more [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=207.04s)]
*  clear. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=208.4s)]
*  Steve Scalise, House Majority [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=209.0s)]
*  Leader told Fox Business, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=210.32s)]
*  I don't support that initiative. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=211.44s)]
*  So, why are we playing this game? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=213.08s)]
*  Look, here's the thing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=215.56s)]
*  Republicans have had about two [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=216.56s)]
*  solid months of absolutely horrid [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=218.16s)]
*  economic news that is not some act [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=219.96s)]
*  of God. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=221.76s)]
*  It is specifically tied to their [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=222.44s)]
*  ideology and the choices that their [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=224.16s)]
*  God Emperor is making. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=226.04s)]
*  All of this is really hurting [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=227.12s)]
*  the perception of Republicans on [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=228.52s)]
*  the economy amongst the electorate. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=230.16s)]
*  And you see that in polls that I'm [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=231.72s)]
*  sure have been covered here on [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=233.44s)]
*  Young Turks. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=235.04s)]
*  That's hurting their chances in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=235.92s)]
*  the midterms and maybe damaging [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  their reputation long term. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=239.38s)]
*  So, they need good press. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=241.12s)]
*  And saying without even promising [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=243.76s)]
*  and certainly not doing an actual [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=245.56s)]
*  tax increase on the wealthiest [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  Americans is an easy way to try to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=248.76s)]
*  offset a little bit of that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  Again, Brett, I would love to be [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=251.64s)]
*  shocked and surprised and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=253.2s)]
*  they actually raise the taxes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=254.48s)]
*  I have a hard time believing that's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=256.36s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=257.84s)]
*  Right, it feels so arbitrary but [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  also not arbitrary and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=260.76s)]
*  mostly partisan or that where [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  people have a double standard. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=264.20000000000005s)]
*  So, if you are tired of the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=267.04s)]
*  Democrats or the Republicans for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=269.68s)]
*  never passing legislation and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=273.0s)]
*  always just talking about passing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=276.04s)]
*  the legislation that you want, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=279.16s)]
*  why are you having faith in Trump [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=281.82000000000005s)]
*  on a semaphore headline? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=284.68s)]
*  I'll be principled, I'll say do it, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  do it, I dare you, I dare you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=290.48s)]
*  I dare you do it, tax the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=293.96s)]
*  millionaires. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=295.6s)]
*  What's interesting to me is that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=296.76s)]
*  this is going to be a tax on [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=298.96s)]
*  millionaires and not billionaires. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=300.62s)]
*  Kudlow alluding to the fact that it [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=303.48s)]
*  would hurt small businesses and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=305.88s)]
*  not enormous businesses. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=308.04s)]
*  Enormous businesses that get all [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=310.08s)]
*  the benefits, the super rich [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=312.36s)]
*  millionaires who get all the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=314.44s)]
*  benefits of the system that Trump [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=316.44s)]
*  creates and the uncertainty that he [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=318.8s)]
*  creates and the backdoor deals that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=321.2s)]
*  he creates and the times he's like, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=323.88s)]
*  I'm going to do this thing and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=326.0s)]
*  right before I turn back on the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=327.56s)]
*  faucet of belay some of the tariffs, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=329.32000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to tell a bunch of people [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  here's how you can make money. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=333.32000000000005s)]
*  And then talking to everyone in [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=335.16s)]
*  these secret meetings in the Oval [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=336.76000000000005s)]
*  Office and we get leaked videos up, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=338.48s)]
*  look at how much money this guy [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=340.36s)]
*  made and that guy made. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you think that was $1 million [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=343.32000000000005s)]
*  a year that that guy made? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=345.04s)]
*  No, that's 100, he said it was, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=346.52000000000004s)]
*  that guy made $100 million in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=348.36s)]
*  that moment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=350.72s)]
*  So do it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=351.22s)]
*  I would say to people, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=351.72s)]
*  he's clearly trying to just get [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=353.12s)]
*  more votes and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=355.12s)]
*  more support from people. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=356.04s)]
*  But he has to get more support, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=357.8s)]
*  you can give him your support if he [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=359.88s)]
*  gives you what you need. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=362.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=363.8s)]
*  But is he raising back up the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=364.32s)]
*  corporate tax rate or [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=366.0s)]
*  the capital gains tax? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=367.36s)]
*  No, he's cutting it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=368.76s)]
*  And that's the thing is like, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=370.88s)]
*  Scott Galloway talks about all this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=372.68s)]
*  stuff in some of the videos that I [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=374.88s)]
*  can't get off my feed and, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=376.88s)]
*  but it's an interesting point that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=378.52s)]
*  there's so much money that's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=380.68s)]
*  there's people who make money off [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=382.96s)]
*  of wages and then there's people [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=384.88s)]
*  that make money off of investments. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  And all this income tax talk is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=389.32s)]
*  people who make money off of wages. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=391.08s)]
*  And I'm all for getting back to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=393.2s)]
*  the marginal tax rates that we had [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=394.96s)]
*  when America was so great. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  I get back to those marginal tax [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  rates like I'll help you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=401.4s)]
*  But in the meantime, everything [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=403.12s)]
*  else that Trump has done has made [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=405.56s)]
*  it easier for the rich to get [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=407.84s)]
*  richer. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=409.84s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=411.48s)]
*  And then everything else he's done [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=412.88s)]
*  is like a fever dream of half [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  a remembrance of something someone [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=416.92s)]
*  didn't actually tell him while he [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=419.2s)]
*  was hopped up on Big Macs when they [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=421.24s)]
*  said the word tariff. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=423.32s)]
*  I think he like watched the first [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=424.56s)]
*  half of that part of Ferris [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=426.6s)]
*  Bueller's day off when he was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  explaining the Holly Smoot Tariff [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  Act before he said that it did not [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=432.64s)]
*  work and the United States sunk [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=435.0s)]
*  deeper into the Great Depression. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=437.24s)]
*  Yeah, so he still thinks the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=440.16s)]
*  tariffs are a great idea and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=441.48s)]
*  he still thinks that you can just [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=442.76000000000005s)]
*  drive the Ferrari in reverse to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=444.32000000000005s)]
*  take off the miles. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he's going to be surprised by [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=447.04s)]
*  the outcome of both of those [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=448.6s)]
*  things. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=449.8s)]
*  Yeah, and in Kudlow, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  just so shocked. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't think he's actually shocked [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  that they're saying they're going [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=454.76000000000005s)]
*  to raise the taxes. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  I think he's shocked that they have [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=457.44s)]
*  to say that because even more [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=459.76000000000005s)]
*  Republican voters think they should [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=461.72s)]
*  raise those taxes. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  Because he just expects, wait, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  this is Fox News, Fox Business. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=467.92s)]
*  You guys are supposed to beat [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=469.52s)]
*  these people into submission into [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=471.12s)]
*  believing that as he puts it, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=473.12s)]
*  a tax on wealthy people is like [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=474.96s)]
*  treating them like a criminal, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=476.84s)]
*  rather than just their expected [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=478.76s)]
*  contribution to America's shared [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=480.64s)]
*  success. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=482.64s)]
*  And he says we're not supposed to [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKFNfjGCSw&t=483.2s)]
