TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Trump Official‚Äôs ABSURD Solution to High Egg Prices
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI)
*  Listen, there is no short term fix. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tomorrow, I wish I could snap my [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=1.98s)]
*  fingers and go to the grocery store [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=4.04s)]
*  Rachel and your eggs are back down [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=6.18s)]
*  to $2 a dozen from $5 or $8 or [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=8.42s)]
*  in California $12. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=10.34s)]
*  But we are on it and we're working [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=11.94s)]
*  night and day to solve it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=14.02s)]
*  Well, I have chickens in my [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=15.9s)]
*  backyard, Sean started that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=17.42s)]
*  And yesterday I went out, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=19.18s)]
*  they just started laying and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=20.48s)]
*  yesterday I got five eggs. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  That must be nice, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=26.1s)]
*  Rachel compost Duffy who, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=27.5s)]
*  is a host over at Fox. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=30.0s)]
*  And she's speaking to Secretary of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=33.68s)]
*  Agriculture Brooke Rawlins about [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=35.72s)]
*  bird flu which has led to a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=37.88s)]
*  shortage of eggs which of course [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=39.7s)]
*  has led to the inflation of prices [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=41.88s)]
*  related to eggs. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=44.18s)]
*  And both of them agree that one of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  the solutions for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=47.44s)]
*  Americans struggling with high egg [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=48.540000000000006s)]
*  prices is for them to just do [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=50.78s)]
*  the simple act of buying and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=52.46s)]
*  raising chickens in their [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=54.22s)]
*  backyards, let's watch. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=55.74s)]
*  Is part of the solution more small [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=58.42s)]
*  farms because when avian flu hits [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  and you have these giant industrial [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=62.42s)]
*  farms and these chickens which I [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=64.44s)]
*  don't think the eggs are as good [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=66.2s)]
*  anyway is part of it just investing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=67.92s)]
*  in smaller farms encouraging that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=69.92s)]
*  I think the silver lining in all of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  this is how do we in our [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=74.72s)]
*  backyards, we've got chickens in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=75.76s)]
*  our backyard. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  How do we solve for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=78.4s)]
*  something like this? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=79.04s)]
*  And people are sort of looking [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=80.04s)]
*  around thinking, wow, well, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  maybe I could get a chicken in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=82.62s)]
*  my backyard and it's awesome. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=83.92s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=85.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think everyone who isn't [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=86.94s)]
*  a farmer right now wants to be so [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=88.42s)]
*  you're in the right department [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=89.76s)]
*  Brooke. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=90.98s)]
*  A lot of people don't have yards [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=91.5s)]
*  and don't have the ability to raise [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  chickens. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=98.22s)]
*  I don't know how feasible this is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=99.34s)]
*  as a solution for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=101.26s)]
*  a lot of Americans Cenk, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=102.22s)]
*  what say you? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=103.6s)]
*  Yeah, so I guess is the chickens [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=105.9s)]
*  coming home to roost, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  So, but look, to be fair to her, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=113.3s)]
*  she did say other things which [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=116.76s)]
*  we're going to get to in a second. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=118.36s)]
*  But to me the real chickens coming [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=120.24s)]
*  home to roost is that these folks [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=122.08s)]
*  saying like, Biden can control [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=123.92s)]
*  inflation 100% and he should be [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=125.72s)]
*  doing this and it's all his fault. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=127.76s)]
*  And as we said on the show, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=130.8s)]
*  it's more complicated than that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=132.36s)]
*  It's more nuanced than that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=134.56s)]
*  It wasn't that Biden handled that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=136.04s)]
*  perfectly at all. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=138.08s)]
*  But sometimes when there's a supply [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=139.6s)]
*  chain issue that's worldwide, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=142.0s)]
*  there really isn't that much you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=145.26s)]
*  could do in the short term, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=146.86s)]
*  And so that's what the Trump [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=148.62s)]
*  administration is seeing here. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=149.9s)]
*  And now all of a sudden they're [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=151.7s)]
*  like, well, of course, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=153.06s)]
*  there's nothing we can do except [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=154.06s)]
*  chickens in your backyard. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=155.5s)]
*  No, well, where were you when you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=158.46s)]
*  were saying the exact opposite in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=160.26s)]
*  the Biden administration? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=162.14s)]
*  So we got to be fair to everybody, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  but she did mention some other [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=165.62s)]
*  things that I want to get to too. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=166.7s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to get to all [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=167.94s)]
*  that in just a minute, but [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=169.34s)]
*  just chickens in the backyard. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=170.58s)]
*  Let's marinate on that a little bit [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  longer because, I mean, what if you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=174.96s)]
*  have an HOA situation, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  And the neighborhood doesn't want [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  your chickens. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=182.0s)]
*  They find the chickens to be [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=183.12s)]
*  disruptive. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  There's so many issues here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  I think this is what [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=187.52s)]
*  administrations need to keep in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=189.12s)]
*  mind. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=191.68s)]
*  This is super important. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't matter if it's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=193.4s)]
*  a Democratic administration or [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Republican administration. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=196.24s)]
*  Once you take a big issue and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=197.72000000000003s)]
*  place the onus on you, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  and place the onus on individuals [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  to deal with it, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  people start getting upset, okay? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=204.54s)]
*  The whole role of government is to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=207.02s)]
*  respond to crises such as this and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=209.3s)]
*  not expect Americans to just deal [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=211.68s)]
*  with it on their own. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=214.06s)]
*  Not everyone, again, has the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=216.06s)]
*  ability to buy chickens and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=217.84s)]
*  raise them in their backyards. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=219.38s)]

*  A lot of people who have yards [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=222.58s)]
*  wouldn't be able to do so [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=223.78s)]

*  lofty statements and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=232.18s)]
*  goals when he was running. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=233.56s)]
*  For instance, he said, when I win, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=234.96s)]

*  In large part, the prices have [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=274.98s)]
*  increased due to the massive [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=277.1s)]

*  166 million chickens. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=294.2s)]
*  Now it's also due in part to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=296.0s)]
*  corporate price gouging with [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=298.0s)]

*  But look, I also want to note, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  Costco recently implemented a rule [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  to stop some of their customers from [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=311.44s)]

*  The last time I was at Costco, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  I kid you not, there was a guy in [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  front of me, his entire cart packed [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=319.64s)]
*  like a mountain of eggs, it was [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=321.84s)]
*  insane. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=323.76s)]
*  So there are people who are also [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=326.08s)]
*  kind of taking advantage of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  this situation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=329.12s)]
*  And I'm glad that some grocery [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=329.96s)]
*  chains have implemented rules to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=331.76s)]
*  prevent people from buying up [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  everything to essentially corner [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=335.48s)]
*  the market for themselves. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=337.52s)]
*  But Cenk, do you want to jump in? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, man, we choked a lot of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=341.1s)]
*  chickens. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=342.74s)]
*  But we do have turkey riding to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=343.3s)]
*  the rescue of chickens here. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=345.54s)]
*  So this is a part of what I was [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=347.98s)]
*  alluding to earlier. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=349.94s)]
*  So it's not like the Trump [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  administration is doing nothing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=353.14000000000004s)]
*  They did announce a $1.5 billion [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=355.34000000000003s)]
*  plan, and that includes figuring [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=357.90000000000003s)]
*  out how to get better vaccines to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=360.22s)]
*  prevent avian flu. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=362.5s)]
*  I thought we were against vaccines, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=363.98s)]
*  interesting. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=365.74s)]
*  But I'm glad they're doing that, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=366.38s)]
*  that's good, that's positive. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  But that is going to take [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=369.08s)]
*  a long time, obviously. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=369.96s)]
*  It's not going to affect it in [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=370.92s)]
*  the short term. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=372.28s)]
*  And they're actually starting to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=373.36s)]
*  import a lot of eggs from Turkey. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=375.4s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=377.4s)]
*  That's now several times that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=378.96s)]
*  Turkey has saved America, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=381.12s)]
*  Cuban Missile Crisis, and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=383.0s)]
*  the Great Egg Crisis of 2025. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=384.88s)]
*  But it gets to the main point. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=386.92s)]
*  Guys, the price of eggs going up [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=390.0s)]
*  really has almost nothing to do [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=392.24s)]
*  with Trump. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=394.4s)]
*  It's avian flu, and sometimes these [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=395.28s)]
*  things happen. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=397.74s)]
*  And the same thing happened during [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=399.46000000000004s)]
*  COVID. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=401.46000000000004s)]
*  So if you're happy that we're being [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=402.1s)]
*  fair to Trump by saying really it's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=404.02000000000004s)]
*  not his fault too much, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=406.02000000000004s)]
*  were you as fair to Joe Biden? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=407.54s)]
*  So we want everybody to be open [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=409.3s)]
*  minded here, and we're very tough [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=411.22s)]

*  Biden on inflation, and it's now [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aRaUiKUdI&t=424.06s)]
