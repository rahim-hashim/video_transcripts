TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c)
*  Here's the only thing that does [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=0.0s)]
*  is done, which is it's so bizarre [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=2.0s)]
*  to me how obsessed you are with [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=4.0s)]
*  federal government. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=6.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=7.2s)]
*  You guys are gonna have a heart [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=8.5s)]
*  attack if you don't calm down. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=10.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, your hysteria is just [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=12.0s)]
*  really really tough. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=14.0s)]
*  That's just last night, Republican [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=15.0s)]
*  Representative Harriet Hageman [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=17.0s)]
*  was in the room with her [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=19.0s)]
*  family and friends. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=21.0s)]
*  And she was talking to her [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=23.0s)]
*  friends about her family and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=25.0s)]
*  friends about her family. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=27.0s)]
*  Hageman holding a town hall in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=29.4s)]
*  Laramie, Wyoming, as you can see, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=31.4s)]
*  it didn't go probably as well as [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=33.7s)]
*  she'd hoped. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=35.7s)]
*  Wyoming has only one representative [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=37.04s)]
*  in Congress, she's it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=39.5s)]
*  And there were over 500 people at [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=41.44s)]
*  the event. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=43.24s)]
*  Hageman's comments on Doge and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=43.84s)]
*  Elon Musk drew some pretty huge [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=45.92s)]
*  boos. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=48.0s)]
*  But she also got some cheering too, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=49.68s)]
*  including the cheering that she did [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=52.0s)]
*  for herself. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=54.2s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  I voted in favor of the continuing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=56.56s)]
*  resolution or CR, which extends [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=59.0s)]
*  funding through the fiscal year [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=61.4s)]
*  until September 30th. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=63.6s)]
*  It keeps the lights on for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=65.4s)]
*  President Trump and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=67.4s)]
*  Doge to continue their work. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=69.0s)]
*  Yeah, so that's one way to handle [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=71.2s)]
*  it, never thought of that as a Sam [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=73.2s)]
*  comedian applauding for myself, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=75.2s)]
*  but I'm going to try it as soon as [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=77.2s)]
*  possible. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=78.8s)]
*  By the way, have you ever had a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=79.36s)]
*  night that bad where you've been [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=80.8s)]
*  heckled like that? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=82.2s)]
*  We're going to move on, Mark, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=83.0s)]
*  we're going to move on. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=84.4s)]
*  Hageman's team claims the crowd was [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=85.44s)]
*  made up of Democrats, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=87.44s)]
*  Democrats, Democrats, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  Democrats, Democrats, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=90.4s)]
*  Democrats, Democrats, Democrats. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=92.04s)]
*  And I'm going to try to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  make that happen. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=96.04s)]
*  I'm going to try to make that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=97.16s)]
*  happen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=98.76s)]
*  It seems the crowd was made up of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=99.36s)]
*  Democratic protesters, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  of course they are. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=102.36s)]
*  Quote, responding to a request for [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=103.72s)]
*  comment, Hageman advisor Tim [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  Murtaugh claimed the town hall [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  interruptions were quote, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=109.6s)]
*  pre-planned and organized partisan [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=111.52s)]
*  disruptions and an embarrassing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  spectacle of manufactured political [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  theater. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=118.32s)]
*  This is the go to now whenever some [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=119.28s)]
*  reality happens that Republicans [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  don't like, they pretend it's not [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=123.0s)]
*  real, it's fake news or it was [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=124.88s)]
*  paid for by people who are just [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  simply trying to take their great [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=128.44s)]
*  intentions right down into [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  the garbage. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=132.0s)]
*  One constituent told NBC News it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  was insulting for Hageman's team to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=135.16s)]
*  accuse the crowd of being [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=137.04s)]
*  Democratic protesters. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  Quote, it's insulting because [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=139.96s)]
*  we're concerned. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=141.56s)]
*  We want to hear answers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=142.76s)]
*  And to be accused that you've been [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=144.88s)]
*  paid by somebody, I mean, don't [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=146.36s)]
*  even it's just really insulting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=147.96s)]
*  that people would assume that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=149.56s)]
*  There was a peaceful demonstration [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=151.64s)]
*  before the town hall that was [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=153.36s)]
*  organized by the Albany County [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=154.76s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=156.24s)]
*  But an official for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=157.4s)]
*  the group insisted that the rage in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=158.32s)]
*  the town hall was from real [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  constituents. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  All of the protest and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=162.68s)]
*  the screaming and the yelling did [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=163.72s)]
*  not come from the local Democratic [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=165.28s)]
*  Party, it came from individuals who [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=166.8s)]
*  are upset with the way things are [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=168.52s)]
*  going in Washington right now. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=170.08s)]
*  We wanted to have a respectful [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=172.08s)]
*  conversation and we did appreciate [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=173.8s)]
*  Rep Hageman coming here to town, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=175.8s)]
*  according to Clifford Marks, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=177.76s)]
*  official for the Albany County [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=179.4s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=181.0s)]
*  Attendees at the Laramie Town Hall [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=181.96s)]
*  also grilled Hageman on the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=183.96s)]
*  qualifications or lack thereof. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=185.56s)]
*  Of the extremely young Doge [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  staffers including of course, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=189.12s)]
*  the one named Big Balls. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=190.72s)]
*  Whether Doge will try to cut social [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=191.96s)]
*  security, whether firing hundreds [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  of federal employees actually [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  making government more efficient or [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=197.52s)]

*  staffing is overrated. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=205.56s)]
*  I think things should be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=206.8s)]
*  understaffed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=207.96s)]

*  No, it may be abusive spending. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=288.12s)]

*  rep is quite disturbing and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=301.52s)]
*  uninspiring to say the least. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=303.92s)]
*  But I'd love to get thoughts from [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=305.52s)]
*  our panel. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  Mark, you first, brother. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=308.12s)]
*  First, I would say if there were [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=310.12s)]
*  Democrats in the crowd, those are [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=311.92s)]
*  also her constituents. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=313.8s)]
*  I mean, the idea somehow that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  Democrats don't have a place at [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=316.72s)]
*  the table just because it's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=318.2s)]
*  a Republican congressperson. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  That's wrong. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=321.12s)]
*  They were elected, but [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=321.72s)]
*  they also represent everybody in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=322.6s)]
*  that district and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=324.04s)]
*  they're Democrats and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=324.72s)]
*  Republicans alike. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=325.52s)]
*  The second thing I would say is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=327.16s)]
*  that you heard in that first clip [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=328.8s)]
*  the way that when you mentioned [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=330.72s)]
*  Doge, which she did, she talked [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=332.48s)]
*  about the Doge underlining of all [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=334.76s)]
*  the waste, fraud and abuse, which [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=337.04s)]
*  as we know is just a flag they fly [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  to dismantle government as they [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  want. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  But in any case, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=344.36s)]
*  the mention of Doge got a huge boo, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  like the booze went to another [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=347.76s)]
*  level. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=349.56s)]
*  And I mention that because it's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=350.36s)]
*  instructive for Democrats or [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=351.8s)]
*  for the opposition, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  whether you're independent or [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=354.12s)]
*  wherever you are on the left or [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=355.56s)]
*  moderate, I would suggest that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=357.0s)]
*  that's instructive. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=358.56s)]
*  Doge and Musk poll horribly. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=359.6s)]
*  They are far more vulnerable to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  attacks. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=364.76s)]
*  That's why I think they should be [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=366.3s)]
*  talked about a lot by the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=367.8s)]
*  opposition than might be Trump, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=368.86s)]
*  even though Trump, I understand, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=370.36s)]
*  is a problematic figure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=371.8s)]
*  So what I get from that meeting, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=372.76s)]
*  are those two things, Ben? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=374.72s)]
*  I mean, just right off the hop. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=376.6s)]
*  Jackson? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=377.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think that a lot of what [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=378.44s)]
*  we've been seeing over the past, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  what, two months and some weeks [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=382.04s)]
*  that Trump's been in office and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=383.8s)]
*  Republican congressmen and senators [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=385.6s)]
*  just being completely unable to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=388.04s)]
*  address their constituents or [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=390.12s)]
*  deal with anything at all because [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=391.88s)]
*  they haven't had to up until now. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=393.72s)]
*  I mean, yeah, people have town [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=395.72s)]
*  halls and stuff all the time, but [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=397.64000000000004s)]
*  up until relatively recently, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=399.56s)]
*  Americans have been somewhat asleep [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=401.32s)]
*  at the wheel of really [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=403.32000000000005s)]
*  understanding what the government's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=404.44s)]
*  doing at all. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=406.56s)]
*  So now that we're out of the era of [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  half measures, Democrats are in and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=409.44s)]
*  they're always talking about, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  well, we'll protect the Affordable [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=413.92s)]
*  Care Act, but we're not going to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=416.04s)]
*  push for a public option or [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  universal healthcare. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=419.32s)]
*  Those days are done. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=420.44s)]
*  Democrats are polling horribly. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=421.88s)]
*  We see what Chuck Schumer is [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=423.84s)]
*  doing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  Pretty much nobody in the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=425.79999999999995s)]
*  Republican or Democratic Party, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  given a couple people here and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=428.67999999999995s)]
*  there, they're just not really [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  ready to meet the moment. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  In addition to a lot of these [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=433.76s)]
*  people are literally in their late [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=435.2s)]
*  70s or early 80s. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=437.0s)]
*  So, even if they're able bodied, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  their time has just come and gone. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=440.32s)]
*  So, so many of these people are [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=443.0s)]
*  looking at the end of their careers, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=444.84s)]
*  whether they realize it or not. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=447.0s)]
*  But just the whole notion of like, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=448.8s)]
*  these are Democratic left wing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=451.0s)]
*  plants, like you pointed out, Mark. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, so what if they were? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  They're still your constituents. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=456.32s)]
*  But it's almost as if these people [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=458.24s)]
*  didn't realize that addressing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=460.88s)]
*  town halls were a part of the job. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=463.48s)]
*  Some of these people literally ran [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=466.8s)]
*  out, so at least she didn't run, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=468.52s)]
*  I guess, but [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=470.32s)]
*  they're just not ready for this. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=471.12s)]
*  There's a smugness to, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=473.52s)]
*  Ben and Jackson to the way that she [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=475.04s)]
*  kind of literally stepped up side [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=477.56s)]
*  from the podium and applauded. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=479.76s)]
*  I mean, she sort of mocked [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=482.0s)]
*  the protest in a way that is really [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  additionally disrespectful. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=485.68s)]
*  And I'm not just evaluating it in [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=487.64s)]
*  this one instance. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=489.28s)]
*  I mean, that general thing that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=490.2s)]
*  it's where there's a smugness or [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=492.79999999999995s)]
*  where you try to ignore what is [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  obviously, there's no way that they [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  are all Democratic plants, of course. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  But the way that that is ignored, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  these protests, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  this pushback in their districts. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=505.64s)]
*  This is a real problem because [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=507.2s)]
*  you'll get to critical mass on [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=508.8s)]
*  that and that's just not cool to be [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  essentially making fun of those in [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=512.52s)]
*  the crowd that are pushing back on [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=514.72s)]
*  real issues that you're having to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=516.76s)]
*  deal with as a congressperson. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=518.88s)]
*  Yeah, I would have to agree with [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=521.4s)]
*  that. I also do think that while [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=522.92s)]
*  it's perfectly appropriate to be [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=524.92s)]
*  upset and outraged even, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=527.12s)]
*  it does need to be done a little [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=529.0s)]
*  bit in a more, I don't know, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=531.28s)]
*  more intentional way of dealing [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=533.56s)]
*  with it, intentional way that can [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=536.48s)]
*  actually get something because just [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=538.84s)]
*  booing sometimes I think is so [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  easy to ignore rather than well [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  made rational points. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  On the flip to see her literally [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=546.8s)]
*  say you guys are too obsessed with [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=548.84s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  You mean the job that you have, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  the reason you are there, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=555.0s)]
*  the thing that determines all of [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=556.52s)]
*  the laws we live under, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=558.52s)]
*  the culture that we have to endure [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=560.0s)]
*  in this nation. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=562.12s)]
*  Is there a more important thing to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=564.12s)]
*  be obsessed with? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=566.0s)]
*  So it just shows the lack of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=566.72s)]
*  understanding for what the mission [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=568.72s)]
*  is when you are sent to Congress. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=571.24s)]
*  The mission is to do everything to [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=573.84s)]
*  fight tooth and nail to improve [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=576.24s)]
*  the lives of your constituents. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=578.4s)]
*  It's not to collect a paycheck and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=581.08s)]
*  just hope people don't get riled up [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=583.2s)]
*  when you fail them. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=585.36s)]
*  And just to pick up on what you've [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=586.84s)]
*  just said, Ben, it is important [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=589.2s)]
*  that in these meetings, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=591.72s)]
*  it's not just a booing and haranguing [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=593.4599999999999s)]
*  because the second clip you played [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=596.18s)]
*  that was much more powerful in [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=598.54s)]
*  a way, right? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=600.56s)]
*  You had a veteran angry. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=601.54s)]
*  There's a sense that once you get [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=604.78s)]
*  that angry statement out, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=607.0999999999999s)]
*  I think the idea is well, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=609.14s)]
*  I've owned the moment. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=610.9s)]
*  What would help you own the moment [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=612.62s)]
*  even more would be to hear [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=614.9s)]
*  the response. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=616.62s)]
*  Because I think in the response [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=617.86s)]
*  there can be the vacancy, right? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=620.06s)]
*  When she tried to answer by reading [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=623.02s)]
*  that list, you see how it's just a [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=625.06s)]
*  vacant bankrupt kind of response. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=626.98s)]
*  And I think that helps make [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=629.54s)]
*  the case slowly. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=631.02s)]
*  And then those meetings actually [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=632.42s)]
*  turn the corner. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=633.74s)]
*  So I think you're right, Ben, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=634.46s)]
*  just the booze that doesn't get [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=635.9s)]
*  it done. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=637.46s)]
*  Sometimes the booze does get it [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=638.14s)]
*  done, but it's just because you [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=639.34s)]
*  have to drink heavily after your [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=640.5s)]
*  representatives let you down. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=641.62s)]
*  Yeah, you got to, man. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=643.22s)]
*  You got to do what you got to do [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=644.18s)]
*  to deal with this. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=645.3s)]
*  But I was just going to say a lot [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=646.74s)]
*  of these people's responses and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=648.3s)]
*  saying, you're just obsessed with [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=650.06s)]
*  the government. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=651.9s)]
*  It's just insecurity responses. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=652.8199999999999s)]
*  They feel that heat in their chest. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=656.22s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=658.22s)]
*  They feel that embarrassment [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=658.98s)]
*  bubbling up. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=660.14s)]
*  They're like, F all of you, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=660.74s)]
*  like screw you guys. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=662.3s)]
*  But that's just not going to cut it [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=664.06s)]
*  for the era that we're going into. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=665.6999999999999s)]
*  It's looking like the 2020s are [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=667.18s)]
*  going to be like a whole decade [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=668.8199999999999s)]
*  marked with strife and moving [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=670.34s)]
*  backwards in a lot of ways. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=671.86s)]
*  Maybe in the 2030s we can get to [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=673.62s)]
*  pick in a lot of this up. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=675.18s)]
*  But it seems like it's been a while [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=676.26s)]
*  since the American public has [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=678.78s)]
*  really done some significant [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=681.5s)]
*  organizing. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=683.7s)]
*  We'll start to then we'll stop. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=685.3800000000001s)]
*  But I think that those days are [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=687.5s)]
*  done. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=689.5400000000001s)]
*  So as you pointed out, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=690.1s)]
*  we got to do more than boo. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=691.46s)]
*  I think that we'll get a lot of [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=694.3800000000001s)]
*  that together, but you're right. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=695.58s)]
*  We do have to do more than just [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=696.7800000000001s)]
*  make noise. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=698.3800000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, and like you said, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=700.1s)]
*  also Mark, just reading that list [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=702.0600000000001s)]
*  kind of wrote, it also just belies [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=704.1400000000001s)]
*  the point that she doesn't have any [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  true belief or conviction about [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=708.5s)]
*  this. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=710.5799999999999s)]
*  But again, it's just repeating [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=711.06s)]
*  and parroting talking points when [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=712.54s)]
*  she says that is the fraud. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=714.2199999999999s)]
*  That is the fraud. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=716.26s)]
*  I need someone in the audience to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=716.9399999999999s)]
*  point out that's literally not [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=718.5s)]
*  fraud. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=720.02s)]
*  It might be abusive spending. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=720.54s)]
*  She's like, yeah, yeah, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=721.8199999999999s)]
*  I said fraud, abuse and waste. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=723.14s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=726.0999999999999s)]
*  Well, fraud is a very different [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=727.4599999999999s)]
*  concept. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=729.4599999999999s)]
*  And if you're reading a list, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=730.26s)]
*  just spewing out that it's fraud [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=732.18s)]
*  when you don't even believe or know [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=734.14s)]
*  or even think that it's fraud. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=736.3s)]
*  It just proves that you're just [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=738.42s)]
*  here to fill time, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=740.5s)]
*  to fill an obligation. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=741.54s)]
*  And you don't care about actually [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=743.14s)]
*  the content of what you're doing. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=745.06s)]
*  You have no critical eye on [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=746.98s)]
*  the administration that you're just [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=748.5s)]
*  rubber stamping all the way straight [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=750.54s)]
*  to a chaotic dismantling of whatever [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=752.54s)]
*  structures we have kind of barely [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=754.66s)]
*  holding the nation in place. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=756.54s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=758.5s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=760.06s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=761.62s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=762.62s)]
*  our live shows. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6felAH73c&t=763.86s)]
