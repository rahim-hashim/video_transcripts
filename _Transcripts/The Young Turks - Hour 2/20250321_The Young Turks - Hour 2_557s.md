TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Bill Burr Continues Humiliating Elon Musk
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM)
*  But is there any particular anybody getting your eye up these days more than usual? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=0.0s)]
*  Nerds. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=6.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=7.72s)]
*  The nerds that own the politician. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=8.72s)]
*  All these tech nerds that wanna build robots cuz they don't know how to talk to hot women. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  They're gonna take over the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=16.28s)]
*  They're literally gonna replace us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=19.28s)]
*  We're like beta right now and they're coming out with like the VCR. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=21.84s)]
*  That was comedian Bill Burr on the view, which you love to see Burr on the view. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=27.2s)]
*  Something I'm sure he wouldn't probably have been excited to do for years ago. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=32.2s)]
*  But he continues to dunk on Elon Musk. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=35.04s)]
*  This time calling Musk a nerd who can't talk to hot women. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  And he didn't stop there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=42.2s)]
*  He joked that Musk's focus on space is so he can ditch this world after he trashes it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=43.44s)]
*  He's gonna destroy this planet, do you understand? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  And then just bounce. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=52.54s)]
*  He's gonna get out of here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=53.92s)]
*  He's here in Bill's actual voice. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=55.56s)]
*  And I think Elon has got the rockets going cuz they realize there's other Earths out [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=57.28s)]
*  there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  And they're gonna trash this one. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  Cuz they don't have any concern for it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=64.8s)]
*  And they're gonna move on to the next Earth. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=66.8s)]
*  And everybody's gonna be standing down here with your blue and red ties going, wait a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=69.72s)]
*  minute, I was on your side. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=73.28s)]
*  They're just gonna leave. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=74.72s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=76.76s)]
*  As we are divided in the escape in pods to another planet, it's a future I could unfortunately [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  see happening. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=82.68s)]
*  And it's not just the view that Burr's doing this on. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=83.68s)]
*  Remember earlier this month he went and dunked on Musk on the breakfast club. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=90.28s)]
*  This guy's sea-tiled twice. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=91.28s)]
*  Once in the front, if you missed it in the back. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's just like he still has a job. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=97.2s)]
*  That guy still has a job? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  I don't understand those guys. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  What I don't get is the amount of veterans that people in the armed services that died [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  trying to stop Hitler. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=109.56s)]
*  And then this guy comes in and does that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=111.6s)]
*  And of course, the first time that Elon Musk that I've seen has been directly even had [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  it brought up for discussion was on Joe Rogan recently. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=123.32s)]
*  And Joe, who prides himself on being buddies with the man, didn't ask him about it directly, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  just led the answer and said basically, it's so ridiculous. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=132.0s)]
*  They say so many people said my heart goes out to you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=135.84s)]
*  You did it a little bit aggressively, but obviously it wasn't that right and like leads [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=138.48s)]
*  his answer to what she says. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's totally ridiculous. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=144.76s)]
*  It's totally ridiculous. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  If you even think that I was doing the exact thing I was clearly doing twice back to back, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  it's totally ridiculous. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=153.88s)]
*  Burr also faced backlash after his comments in which he said billionaires are like rabid [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=155.72s)]
*  dogs that should be put down. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=160.88s)]
*  He laughed off the outrage saying he was just, I'm just exaggerating for my podcast, which [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=163.33999999999997s)]
*  is a great excuse to give but also a sentiment that clearly is not nonexistent in the zeitgeist [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=168.32s)]
*  it, you know, CC Luigi Mangione on that one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=176.12s)]
*  Mark? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=180.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think busting on the billionaire class is really smart. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=181.92s)]
*  And I love the way he does it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=189.12s)]
*  I mean, all you know, you, Burr, the comics who can sort of weave just beautifully the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=190.48s)]
*  reality of where we sit with the gulf between where most of us have and what those in control [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=196.72s)]
*  have. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=203.64s)]
*  I mean, I think that's just it's wonderful. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=204.64s)]
*  And you know, the idea also that he mentioned Mars and, you know, going to outer space, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=206.55999999999997s)]
*  which is also just another grift. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  You understand you cannot go to Mars. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=214.0s)]
*  You cannot build a colony on Mars. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  It's the stuff of sci-fi. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=217.6s)]
*  There are a bunch of like real grounded scientific reasons. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=218.6s)]
*  You can't do it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  A lunar development would probably be more practical, but neither one makes any sense. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=225.24s)]
*  Trashing this planet is the truly nonsensical thing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=230.56s)]
*  Taking care of this planet is the thing that makes the most sense. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  But I love that the billionaire class finally makes its way into conversation because this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  is truly, I think, what will ultimately be cutting through the noise. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=242.84s)]
*  And I think it's going to make a case whether they want it or not for the opposition, the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=247.94s)]
*  left and the Democrats. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=252.16s)]
*  You know, speaking of Mars, Elon Musk said something like in 2039, we'll have 20 million [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=253.16s)]
*  people living on Mars. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=259.92s)]
*  Like he just says stuff. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=261.24s)]
*  I'm telling you, I have despised that man for as long as he has been in the public eye. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=264.04s)]
*  I immediately knew he was full of it because it's like, and I've said this many times on [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=270.76s)]
*  the program, I hate him just so the passion is going to come out. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=276.08s)]
*  All he has done for decades is lie and lie and lie and lie. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=280.64s)]
*  And that's why Tesla stock is dropping so fast because it was all hype and all BS to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=285.12s)]
*  begin with. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  Because Tesla barely sells any cars. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=291.06s)]
*  Elon Musk is a walking mascot. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=293.32s)]
*  That's all he is. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=295.56s)]
*  And just one thing for all the listeners and anybody who may see this segment, if you ever [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=296.64s)]
*  feel like your life is just not where you want it to be, if you ever feel like you don't [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  have enough, I want you to stop feeling that way and look at Elon Musk. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=305.94s)]
*  A man who has everything anybody could ever possibly desire and it's not enough for him. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=309.88s)]
*  This dude pretends to be other people on Twitter and talks in his own voice to talk about how [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=315.4s)]
*  cool Elon Musk is, pretends to be a gaming champion when clearly he's not. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  He's so lame. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  He's just whack. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=328.96s)]
*  He's whack. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=330.0s)]
*  And he is making all these decisions in the government only because he put forth almost [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=331.32s)]
*  $300 million into Donald Trump's campaign. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  That's the only reason he's there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  And never forget during Trump's first term when Donald Trump roasted him on Twitter. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=341.6s)]
*  What he say, rocket ships to nowhere, cars that don't drive long enough, you would be [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=347.04s)]
*  nothing without subsidies. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  But now you his vice president. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=355.12s)]
*  So it just goes to show that Donald Trump is just a corrupt empty husk with no real [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=356.92s)]
*  plan. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  The only plan this go around was to not go to prison, job well done. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=364.0s)]
*  And now these fools are just running amok. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=368.4s)]
*  But I hate Elon Musk. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  I really do. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=372.96s)]
*  I think that's actually the slogan for Trump Musk 2028, a corrupt empty husk with no real [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  plan. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=381.47999999999996s)]
*  It's a working title anyway. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  It's a working title. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  Husk is a good word for it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  It kind of has like a corn husk kind of a vibe with the hair and the orange and all [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  of that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=392.52s)]
*  It just is a very strange place. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=393.88s)]
*  And I think you're right also, Mark, when you say that there's the hints. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=396.2s)]
*  You might have said that in the last story, but there's the hints of going a bridge too [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  far when they have their own constituents, people in deep red states complaining, not [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=405.52s)]
*  just the Democrats in those states. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=411.32s)]
*  But when you see the veterans who voted for Trump, when you see the Republicans who voted [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  for Trump that are straight up saying, wait a minute, how and in what way does affecting [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=420.32s)]
*  social security for my grandparents or my parents and what way is that a good thing? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  And what way is letting our jobs disappear? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=432.67999999999995s)]
*  And what ways have hazardly making these cuts a good thing for us while they just see their [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=434.67999999999995s)]
*  own net worth raising and raising and raising? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=441.79999999999995s)]
*  You also remind me, Jackson, that I probably need to figure out what to do with my Tesla [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=444.08s)]
*  stock because I bought it many years ago, way before he ever purchased Twitter. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=448.24s)]
*  And that thing is taking such a nosedive. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=453.36s)]
*  I have to probably hold it at this point or just take a real I don't know what to do, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=455.16s)]
*  but that's my own personal problems. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=459.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I can give you any good advice in that regard. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  But yeah, it's just Elon Musk is basically reaping what he sold for the past couple of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=465.72s)]
*  decades. That's really all that's happened. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, he bought, as you said, Jackson, he bought the presidency and he's been given [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=473.36s)]
*  this incredible freedom to go wherever he wants in government with his his henchmen, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=476.84s)]
*  you know, the 18 to 26 year old tech bro. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=482.76s)]
*  One of these. Yeah, totally. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=485.88s)]
*  Totally. It's it's chilling. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=488.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's totally it's totally insane. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=490.64s)]
*  And it's it's it's power run amok without any check. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=493.44s)]
*  And I bring out the fact that I own some Tesla stock for a reason, because it's not to my [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=497.4s)]
*  benefit to cover a story like this, because it's going to hurt the stock more, most likely [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=502.92s)]
*  as this comes out. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=508.88s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=510.36s)]
*  I don't care. We have a story coming up talking about how badly Tesla stock is doing, about [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=511.68s)]
*  how people are selling their cars, how the cars are being recalled. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=517.88s)]
*  You still report what matters to the populace. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=520.96s)]
*  You still have opinions about what is to benefit the greater good, even if it hurts you personally. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=524.84s)]
*  That's how you know you're still in integrity with what you stand for and what you present publicly. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=531.16s)]
*  And those who only care about their own benefit and sweep every morality under the rug are [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=536.52s)]
*  the Republican Party these days to be as frank as possible. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=543.36s)]
*  Well, they look the other way and a lot of stuff. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=547.4s)]
*  You're absolutely right, Ben. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=549.2s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  Totally not true. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=553.68s)]
*  But it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6QNDks8nM&t=554.76s)]
