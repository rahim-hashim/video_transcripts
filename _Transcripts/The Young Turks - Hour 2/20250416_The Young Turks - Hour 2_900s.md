King and several other celebrities ‚Äî including pop star Katy Perry ‚Äî took part in an all-woman space flight Monday morning. The fiancee of Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos was also part of the group."

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# All-Female Celebrity Trip Gets The ROAST Treatment
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc)
*  And here they come, loading into the capsule arm. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=0.0s)]
*  And the significance here of the bell, and I should note before I have you explain that, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=4.0s)]
*  each crew names themselves, they have named themselves the six taking up space, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=8.0s)]
*  as each one is ringing a bell, and the significance of that is what, Arianna? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=13.0s)]
*  This is one of our traditions. All astronauts throughout history in various programs have had their traditions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=18.0s)]
*  For us, we always want our astronauts to ring the bell above there. You see light this candle. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=26.0s)]
*  Why did Jeff Bezos have to be there and ruin it? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=34.0s)]
*  Anyway, so there you're seeing the crew of the Blue Origin flight that's drawn a lot of attention throughout this week. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=36.0s)]
*  They took an 11 minute suborbital space tourism mission, and it's pitched as historic, which it definitely is. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=43.0s)]
*  And then of course, everybody on board that vehicle was a woman, which is the first time that we've actually had that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=52.0s)]
*  But that isn't really the reason it's drawing so much attention necessarily. Partially, it's the star power. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=58.0s)]
*  You did have big names like CBS morning host Gail King, singer Katy Perry, Bezos' fiance Lauren Sanchez. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=64.0s)]
*  And then you had people arguably far better qualified to be there, like activist Amanda Nguyen and aerospace engineer Aisha Bao as well. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=73.0s)]
*  And then you also had film producer Carrie Anne Flynn. But the fact that this was an incredibly expensive and in terms of the climate damaging mission, as all space flights are. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=80.0s)]
*  With the end goal of it being that some famous people got to spend 11 minutes floating a little bit has, I think, soured the historic nature of it for some people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=91.0s)]
*  Now, those who were on the vehicle want you to focus on how amazing it is, the experience, how it's changed their view of things. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=102.0s)]
*  Lauren Sanchez says Earth looked so, it was so quiet. And you look at it and you're like, we're all in this together, which sure we've heard things like that from astronauts before. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=109.0s)]
*  Generally, they were a little bit farther away and they were there for more than 11 minutes, but that's fine. I don't begrudge her, her mind altering experience. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=119.0s)]
*  Gail King had said, you look down at the planet and you think that's where we came from. To me, it's such a reminder about how we need to do better, be better. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=126.0s)]
*  Again, the sort of thing that we hear from astronauts, again, they were gone for 11 minutes. So when they get out of the vehicle and they're kissing the ground and stuff, it just it seems over the top in a lot of different ways. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=135.0s)]
*  The way that it's so expensive and there's big stars and even the way that they sort of tried to choreograph it and it kind of failed also bothered people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=149.0s)]
*  So here is Jeff Bezos tripping as he raced to open the capsule door. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=158.0s)]
*  To share this experience with you and thank you for sharing how you feel out here with our audience. So it's been really, really incredible. So yeah, so it's been really, really incredible. So yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=163.0s)]
*  So that was just a trip, but he is a billionaire, which means that in the time it took him to recover from that trip, he made $8 million. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=177.0s)]
*  Anyway, it just it bothers people. Are we just are we haters to point it out? Like some would say don't even focus on it. Obviously the whole point of it was for it to be focused on. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=183.0s)]
*  And I think we should learn lessons from things. I like space flight. I'm a nerd. I like Star Wars. I like Star Trek. I like Star Galactica. But I just I don't know who this is really helping. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=196.0s)]
*  Okay, to send Katy Perry to space. Everybody got a little something out of it. Everybody gets something out of it. Like the rocket shaped like a wiener for a reason and everybody involved in this story talking about this story. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=205.0s)]
*  Whether they love it or hate it, they are all in a sense, pleasuring themselves. Some were choking themselves. Some while genuinely enjoying it is my take on all of it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=219.0s)]
*  Like what role does any of this like play in your life? If you're saying that this is a bad thing for the environment, you are correct. It is one flight. Also, coal energy creates like a bajillion times more than this pollution. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=231.0s)]
*  Like is it going to inspire girls to get into STEM is that they say like, and I'm biased like my cousin works at the company and she like isn't she's she but she's a badass like pilot. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=249.0s)]
*  Like she's awesome. She's an awesome pilot who is involved in this and like does the commentating is like on some of these launches and everything. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=261.0s)]
*  Like she's inspired to get into STEM because of stuff like this to be a pilot to get into aviation because of stuff like this and that's good. And it's not not every flight that this is the stuff is used for ease. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=270.0s)]
*  So that we can send Gale King into suborbital space. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=283.0s)]
*  I think they got to test these kinds of technologies to get to the point where it is. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=288.0s)]
*  Are we going to laud them in a way that is disproportionate to the utility of this part of the process? I don't think anyone should. I don't think anyone should be like, yeah, but I like there's so many points like it's okay to look at a story like this and be like here are the good things about it and here are the bad things about it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=292.0s)]
*  I think that's okay and I think we all need to give ourselves permission for that. Like I got out of it. Like I think it's great to watch a billionaire fall. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=315.0s)]
*  I loved that. It's worth all of the pollution in the world to watch Jeff Bezos each in a hole in the desert. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=323.0s)]
*  Bonus episode. I think we're fine. Yes, that was a little bit funny. I love he's worked out so much to stop seeming like a dork and he still seemed like a dork. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=333.0s)]
*  I love it. I feel seen for once. Yeah, again, and look, you're not supposed to as you said, acknowledge both the good and the bad. You're supposed to have a pure take. People love pure takes. They want to watch pure takes. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=344.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be totally pure. As I said, not everybody was a celebrity. The activist Amanda that got sent up has had a tragic past. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=356.0s)]
*  Wanted to be an astronaut, got sexually assaulted, went through this whole thing to become an activist and all that. I love that she had this experience. That's great. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=364.0s)]
*  I don't really care that Katy Perry or Gail King had it, but I think for some people it's good. And if it inspires more people, not just women and girls, but yeah, sure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=371.0s)]
*  I think that's good. I think that that is good. I think at the same time, it's a little silly and a little bit of the top. Right. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=381.0s)]
*  And if you expect to have like if you expect to just have this mission go off and have no one have a negative opinion about it and feel like how dare they have a negative opinion about that's a bad expectation of going in. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=389.0s)]
*  Like unrealistic. It's too many people say, listen, I just want to get this out there and I want to raise awareness about my thing. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=405.0s)]
*  And then when other people raise awareness about the fallout of your thing or the other connotations of the thing or their thing, you can't really be upset about it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=412.0s)]
*  You started the conversation. And then in terms of like it with celebrities, when they kind of like if a celebrity is canceled for a bad, bad reason, like that's bad. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=423.0s)]
*  But like if a celebrity has less of an amazing time that day and for the next month, like I I want to be the person who cares. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=432.0s)]
*  I really do. But I'm not. Yeah. Like I'm just like, like I got to there's a there's a little handicap on that. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=441.0s)]
*  You know, like I can't I can't, you know, handicap like golf. Like, you know, you're already doing well. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=450.0s)]
*  If you have a slightly bad day, I'm not going to lose sleep over it. No one died. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=455.0s)]
*  And look, I don't want to the fact that it's a historic thing and it's all women. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=460.0s)]
*  I like I'm sure there's there's many people criticizing them. Some of them probably going super over the top in that respect. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=464.0s)]
*  That's not I don't think that's an element for me. If it was if it was Drake that had gone, I think I would have the same opinion probably. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=469.0s)]
*  And I get that that is frustrating for some of them. Why don't we we have a few minutes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=478.0s)]
*  Why don't we jump to the K-4 and see Gail King is not happy that there's been this much criticism. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=482.0s)]
*  Let's see a little bit of what she had to say in their defense. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=488.0s)]
*  There are so many things that have been developed in space that benefit Earth from pharmaceuticals to like research and agriculture. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=491.0s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, I paused there because we did research and it was emotional. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=502.0s)]
*  I mean, part of what I accomplished in my flight was I was looking at the future of being able to produce crops that can withstand harsh environments so we can look at food security here on Earth. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=508.0s)]
*  And simultaneously, we also were able to certify that device so more people could do research on the shepherd. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=518.0s)]
*  So what do you think when people say, oh, it's frivolous, number one, they call it a ride, which I find very irritating because they never say men went for a ride. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=525.0s)]
*  What do you say to people who think that this was frivolous or just a ride? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=532.0s)]
*  I think the message that it sends is very, very powerful. And the people that say that, by the way, weren't there. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=536.0s)]
*  I wish they could have seen the face of Zofia. I don't know if you got a chance to meet her, but she's a six-year-old who we hosted. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=541.0s)]
*  And to say she was excited is an understatement. And I asked her, okay, you've now gotten a chance to see a launch. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=548.0s)]
*  What do you want to do? And she's like, I want to go to space and I want to help protect Earth. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=555.0s)]
*  I think that's great. And I like that she was inspired. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=559.0s)]
*  I might make the case that you could probably inspire her for less than like a billion dollars. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=564.0s)]
*  And you could probably fund like dozens of science programs in schools to help her achieve that goal for the same costs of sending Katy Perry for 11 minutes in a space. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=570.0s)]
*  Again, look, I don't know the first one to speak. I don't know about the mission that she went on. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=578.0s)]
*  It's possible that a great deal of science was done in this 11 minute flight. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=583.0s)]
*  I didn't see any photos of Katy Perry with beakers or whatever. I don't think she was doing any science. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=586.0s)]
*  And Gayle King says, why are they calling it a ride? Because you weren't piloting it. It was an autonomous vehicle. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=592.0s)]
*  You weren't flipping switches. You weren't measuring fuel. It was just a ride. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=598.0s)]
*  Look, if it was, I don't know, ripped torn in there. So again, it would just be a ride. He wouldn't be piloting it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=605.0s)]
*  The astronauts that are generally talked about, they're doing things on the ship. That's why it's not just a ride. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=615.0s)]
*  They're not just passengers. They're actual astronauts. You went into sub-autospace. That's great. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=622.0s)]
*  That doesn't make you Captain Kirk. It's not the same thing. Again, it doesn't make you the biggest villain in the world or anything. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=627.0s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that you were on the ISS for six months, exposing yourself to cosmic radiation and doing science and stuff. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=633.0s)]
*  It's just not the same thing. Right. I love what happens to me during these conversations. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=641.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of us, just as they're doing experiments in the plane to see if they can, I don't know, grow corn in 11 minutes. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=647.0s)]
*  I don't know what that experiment was. They were up for 11 minutes. How do we learn about it? Maybe we did. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=656.0s)]
*  It has to be a different flight that they're talking about. It has to have been. Yes, it absolutely had to have been a different. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=659.0s)]
*  And that's fine. But the first person to go to space, that's impressive. First person to go to the moon, that's impressive. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=664.0s)]
*  The 50th person to go to the moon, you're like, cool, is it still not made of cheese? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=670.0s)]
*  These are all real considerations in the conversation. There's hubris in going to space. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=677.0s)]
*  There's hubris in thinking that if you're a pop star and you go to suborbital space, you've changed the world somehow. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=687.0s)]
*  You haven't. Katy Perry fans are really jazzed right now. Gayle King fans are really jazzed right now. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=699.0s)]
*  And this is just part of it. I do think that what ends up happening in any story like this that isn't like, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=706.0s)]
*  giant ly important, we end up interacting with it. And the longer we interact with it, what am I going to do? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=713.0s)]
*  Maybe we stop Jeff Bezos in the long run, maybe from doing this kind of stuff. Maybe they're going to have a meeting and see if this went well. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=722.0s)]
*  And they're going to adjust. And public opinion, negative public opinion and blowback like that will affect the future of their decisions because it was a PR stunt. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=731.0s)]
*  Or they would have just done it. Yeah, my mom like lives in central California and she hears every SpaceX rocket and they send them up every single day. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=741.0s)]
*  Right. They don't fanfare Trump at every one of those rocket launches. Right. Yeah. So that's a possibility. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=756.0s)]
*  They chose to highlight this because probably Elon's past that point of his experience. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=764.0s)]
*  Like when they have a new thing, they tout it. They might just re they were like, oh, we've done it before. Let's do it with all ladies. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=771.0s)]
*  What's the next one going to be? How will it be? And it's cool. It is cool. And I do think it sucks that like because of all the stuff we've been talking about, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=780.0s)]
*  There's going to be girls who look and they see the conversation on Instagram and see Emily Ratajkowski go make a lot of great points and then be like, yo, I don't want to get into STEM. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=790.0s)]
*  I want to get into whatever she's talking about. And so that that's a we have a versus because of the decisions that they made to do this. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=799.0s)]
*  There's a versus and there's going to be people on either side of the versus. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I just we're trying to, you know, we're trying to reflect multiple ways of thinking about it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=808.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to be an asshole. That's never my goal. I mean, like when we do a story about Jesse Waters and Marjorie Green, I'm generally trying to be an asshole. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=817.0s)]
*  But like when it's about space, I want us to go to space. I want space to be cool. But it's also we live in a complex world. Okay, we just do. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=824.0s)]
*  I don't think you're trying to be an asshole with Jesse Waters. Like I think you're being right. You're just trying to be, you know, just and have principles and maybe fight fire with fire. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=833.0s)]
*  But my definition, like that is a test that I frequently apply to stuff like I got in trouble with this. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=844.0s)]
*  But like with the gender identity and pronouns stuff like the test in this discussion, people are talking about wee wees and b-holes and b-holes. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=850.0s)]
*  It's weird because your a-hole is your b-hole and your c-hole is your d-hole. But anyways, like I said, the test is not about those parts. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=861.0s)]
*  It's whether you're being an asshole while it happens. Like if you're intentionally trying to be an asshole, that's all I care about. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=869.0s)]
*  If you're genuinely trying to have a conversation about this stuff and you're not trying to be just like a jerk, then like we can have the conversation and that's a safe space for us to have the discourse. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=876.0s)]
*  But if you show up being like, I just want to ruin someone's day, like that's enough. That's enough. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1XKhfV7bVc&t=888.0s)]
