"President Trump said Friday that he will sign an executive order to extend the deadline for China-based tech company ByteDance to sell TikTok to a U.S. buyer. ByteDance later acknowledged in a statement that it was working with the U.S. government on a sale but that an agreement had not been reached.

‚ÄúMy Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress,‚Äù Trump wrote on Truth Social. ‚ÄúThe Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days.‚Äù

# Trump Gives TikTok Another Lifeline
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ)
*  Tell us about the news when it comes to TikTok. It looks like the president is gonna announce [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=0.0s)]
*  maybe today some proposal. Maybe America owns 50% of TikTok, a private investor will own [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=5.04s)]
*  the other part. Is that gonna happen today? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=12.96s)]
*  Tomorrow, Saturday, April 5th, marked the second deadline for TikTok's parent company [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=17.04s)]
*  ByteDance to strike a deal and sell partial ownership of the app or face another ban in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=22.64s)]
*  the United States. But don't worry, TikTok won't be going dark because Trump has extended [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=29.76s)]
*  the deadline yet again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=34.4s)]
*  Now, Cenk, we'll get to you in a second. But first, let's listen to a bit more of what [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=35.92s)]
*  JD Vance had to say regarding the updates on the TikTok situation. Take a look. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=39.88s)]
*  So I don't wanna get ahead of any presidential announcements here. But what I said is we've [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=44.72s)]
*  been working very hard, me and the president, the entire team, to really accomplish two [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=48.24s)]
*  things. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=52.92s)]
*  First of all, you wanna make sure that the TikTok app in the United States is not spying [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=53.92s)]
*  on people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  That's good for national security. You also wanna give people access to this incredible [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=58.4s)]
*  platform, which as we know, that's where a lot of young people get their news. That's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=62.4s)]
*  where a lot of young people found out about the policies of the Trump administration. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=66.16s)]
*  And we gotta accomplish both of those things. I think that we're in a good place. We're [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=70.16s)]
*  gonna keep on working at it, but I'll let the president make that announcement. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=73.52s)]
*  Now, Cenk, I wanna bring you in here and get your thoughts. But I also did notice, especially [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=76.24s)]
*  relevant to our last conversation, they wanna make sure TikTok's not spying on anyone. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=80.0s)]
*  Yeah, that should be left up to Peter Thiel and Palin Thiel. Okay, know your role. So [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=85.8s)]
*  anyways, look, there's real reasons why they're extending the TikTok ban and hence not taking [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=92.64s)]
*  them off. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=100.56s)]
*  You're gonna be shocked to find out it might have to do with Donald Trump's contributors. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=101.56s)]
*  No, but in this case, it's a good thing for two different reasons. We'll get into that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=105.92s)]
*  in a little bit. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  Now, as we know, TikTok went dark for its 170 million US users the day before Trump [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  took office, but was restored as a result of Trump's actions. Trump had signed an executive [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=117.52s)]
*  order delaying the enforcement of the ban for 75 days, and proposed the US should own [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=123.88s)]
*  50% of the platform in a, quote, joint venture. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=129.88s)]
*  So what has happened since then? TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, previously said [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=133.56s)]
*  it had no plans to sell TikTok, citing in part the Chinese government's opposition to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  a sale. However, on January 20th, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, Mao Ning, told [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=143.68s)]
*  reporters that the decision, quote, should be independently decided by companies in accordance [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=150.34s)]
*  with market principles. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  And many corporations have made offers, it seems. Multiple outlets have reported that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=157.74s)]
*  the Oracle Corporation is the front runner to buy TikTok. Oracle is one of the world's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=162.56s)]
*  largest software companies and one of three major backers behind Trump's $500 billion [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=168.12s)]
*  AI infrastructure investment. TikTok has worked with Oracle to store and process user data [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=172.96s)]
*  in the US since 2020. Other big name players like Amazon and OnlyFans also threw their [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=179.08s)]
*  names in the ring for consideration as of this week. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=185.72s)]
*  Amazon's bid, we are told, is not being taken seriously according to those involved in the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  talks. In regards to OnlyFans, founder Tim Stokely partnered with a cryptocurrency foundation [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=195.76s)]
*  to create a new startup for the bid. The intent to bid was sent this week to the White House [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=201.16s)]
*  by Zoop, billionaire Stokely's new company, and the HBAR Foundation, which manages the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=206.92s)]
*  Hedera Cryptocurrency Network's treasury. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=212.32s)]
*  While OnlyFans is known mainly for pornography, Zoop is a mainstream and family-friendly site [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=215.56s)]
*  and gives back the majority of its revenue to those who post on the site, rewarding them [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=221.8s)]
*  for driving up user engagement. Other parties throwing around offers include Blackstone [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=227.84s)]
*  and other private capital firms, Microsoft, Frank McCourt, the former owner of the Dodgers, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=233.68s)]
*  Project Liberty, and even Mr. Beast. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=240.68s)]
*  But no deal has been solidified, and even if it was, the Chinese government would still [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=243.76s)]
*  need to approve the deal before it can be completed. This also comes at the same time [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump increased China's tariffs. Note, Trump previously stated he'd consider lowering the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  tariffs with China to help reach a deal. The TikTok-related announcement came after Trump [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  signed a far-reaching reciprocal tariff policy at the White House in which he imposed a 34% [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=264.92s)]
*  tariff rule on China. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  Coupled with the existing 20% tariffs on Chinese imports, the true tariff rate on China is [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=272.64000000000004s)]
*  now 54%. So as a result of all of this, Trump extended the deadline again, writing on TruthSocial, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=277.68s)]
*  My administration has been working very hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=287.32s)]
*  tremendous progress. The deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=290.92s)]
*  signed. He goes on and on. We don't have a deal. Before the hour ends, Cenk, I want to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=297.56s)]
*  bring you in here. What do you think of this and how we got to this point? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=302.6s)]
*  So I don't want them shutting down TikTok. I think this is a terrible idea. So I like [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=306.36s)]
*  TikTok, but that's my personal affinity to TikTok is not the relevant part. The fact [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=310.68s)]
*  that hundreds of millions of people use TikTok, some of them make their living on TikTok. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=317.72s)]
*  Certainly, they get out their messages on TikTok. All of that is what's relevant, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=322.68s)]
*  and shutting it down is totally unacceptable. So number two, they're lying to you. They're not [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=326.2s)]
*  really worried about China and they're spying. They're worried about Israel. And I'm not just [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=331.8s)]
*  making that up. Senator Mark Warner, Senator Mitt Romney, Representative Mike Gallagher, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=336.44s)]
*  in a bipartisan fashion, we've showed it to you many, many times on the show have said, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=341.96s)]
*  yeah, we were doing it for Israel. I mean, it's actually stunning that they just say it in public. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=346.6s)]
*  Because why? People are seeing the slaughter in Gaza on TikTok, and they're like, no, no, no, no, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=351.8s)]
*  we got mainstream media all bottled up. And they know their role and they shut up about Israel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=357.72s)]
*  But these real human beings on TikTok won't shut up. We can't stop their videos, right? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=363.08s)]
*  So that's the number one reason why they wanted to shut down TikTok. Number two, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  or whatever number we're on, Scott Galloway had actually a really good point about this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=375.08s)]
*  If an American company buys it, because it gets rid of the regulatory overhang on it, the value [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  of the company will go up about 25%. And it's already a mega valuable company. So that is [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  billions of dollars on the line. So whoever greases the Trump administration better, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=392.44s)]
*  might get that several billion dollars when they're the ones that are allowed to buy TikTok, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=398.36s)]
*  either in whole or in part. So those are the games that are being played behind everybody's back. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=403.48s)]
*  So why did Trump switch his position on this? Because when he was in office, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=408.92s)]
*  he was also trying to ban TikTok, because Trump is just conducting an auction. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=412.76s)]
*  Earlier, he was like, who wants to ban TikTok? Here we go, do I hear Israel? Israel, going once, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=417.4s)]
*  going twice. Who would like to ban it? I'll take some money from you and I'll ban it, okay? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=421.96s)]
*  Now, while he was running, Jeff Yass, well, who's Jeff Yass? Here, let me tell you real quick. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  Scrutographic six. A billionaire investor and club for growth donor Jeff Yass holds a 15% stake in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=429.96s)]
*  TikTok's parent company, Bike Dance. Club for growth leaders have been vocal opponents of the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=435.15999999999997s)]
*  move to ban TikTok. Club for growth president David McIntosh has been in meetings on the hill [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=439.64s)]
*  with Conway and about the issue, according to one of the people familiar with the meetings. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=444.84s)]
*  So then former President Donald Trump praised Yass as fantastic when they were both at the club [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=448.12s)]
*  for growth retreat as a presumptive Republican nominee. Courts he asked to help his presidential [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=454.36s)]
*  campaign, really? Shortly after the meeting, Trump wrote on True Social Thursday, this is of course [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=459.0s)]
*  earlier. If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=464.44s)]
*  But right now, Zuckerschmuck is in the middle of also funneling money to Donald Trump. And so he [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=469.72s)]
*  might also avoid regulation. So, and even Steve Bannon called the flip flop on TikTok, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=474.76s)]
*  quote simple, Yass coin, right? So Yass gave one and a half million dollars to Trump's campaign [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=483.88s)]
*  at that point. And they're promising to give a lot more to Donald Trump. So Donald Trump's now [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=489.24s)]
*  the second part of the auction. Okay, Israel, you've been outbid. Jeff, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=494.28s)]
*  Yass has got one and a half million. Can I see two? Can I see two and a half? Can I see? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=499.8s)]
*  You're gonna give it to me in my campaign? Not bad, but I already won. Give it to me in my meme [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=503.96s)]
*  coin that goes directly into my pocket. Here we go. Can I see four and a half million? Can I see [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=507.24s)]
*  five and a half million? That's what's being, this is politics in America. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=511.08s)]
*  I have to think that first of all, just so folks know, the Chinese government owns in this app. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=514.68s)]
*  That's how business works in China. The government, businesses exist at the behest of the CCP. So [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=522.68s)]
*  that's what is telling me is driving this extension. They can't just bully the Chinese [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=530.6s)]
*  in the be like, we're gonna take away your US market. I don't think they're motivated [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=536.9200000000001s)]
*  by money in the same way that obviously Americans are. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=541.08s)]
*  And so the Chinese probably want something in return if they're gonna sell this valuable [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=545.64s)]
*  piece of internet real estate. And I think that's what's holding this up. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=551.32s)]
*  They can't just strong on the CCP into selling TikTok to them. And I feel pretty confident that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=555.0s)]
*  the CCP isn't really scared that they no longer get to have TikTok in America. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=562.12s)]
*  Yeah, mind you on the surveillance thing, what they're accusing TikTok of doing is what the US [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=567.88s)]
*  government does through every social media and digital platform. It is ultimately projection. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=575.16s)]
*  If they're worried about it, look inward. But on this deal CNBC reported this afternoon that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=581.24s)]
*  there was a deal in place as of Wednesday, and the tariffs caused it to implode. They had a deal, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=586.6s)]
*  they had people lined up, everything was in place, and Donald Trump's tariffs [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=593.48s)]
*  caused it to all get scuttled. Okay, last thing is to go along with what Jordan said. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=598.12s)]
*  Look, if you're worried about spying, do a universal rule that applies to all the social media. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=602.76s)]
*  Why not? What kind of logic is no, China spying on you is bad, but if a zucker schmuck in Trump's [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=606.2s)]
*  terms does it on Facebook, totally fine. If YouTube does it, totally fine. Everything's fine, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=613.24s)]
*  unless of course we're trying to make money from TikTok. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KU93UY9sQ&t=618.44s)]
