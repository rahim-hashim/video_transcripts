# Senator FLEES Town Hall After Tough Questions About Budget Cuts
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M)
*  I support the veterans, but what you're doing right now, like the government is doing right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=0.0s)]
*  now as far as cutting out those jobs, a huge percentage of those people, and I know you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=5.76s)]
*  care about the veterans, are veterans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=13.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=17.92s)]
*  And that is a damn shame. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=18.92s)]
*  What you just witnessed was a cowardly Republican Senator, Roger Marshall, abruptly ending a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=23.84s)]
*  Kansas town hall meeting early after his constituents asked him some tough questions, confronted [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=33.68s)]
*  him about Trump's funding freezes and mass firings of federal workers, including veterans. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=40.04s)]
*  30% of federal workers happen to be veterans, so of course this is an issue that's going [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=46.8s)]
*  to impact their lives. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=52.199999999999996s)]
*  Now Trump actually won 85% of the vote in rural Loudoun County where this town hall [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=53.92s)]
*  actually took place. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=60.6s)]
*  But Kansans from all over the state actually came to confront Marshall about the new administration's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=62.3s)]
*  actions, which have touched the lives of workers in their state. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=67.2s)]
*  So last week, local news reported that the funding freeze leaves Kansas farmers unpaid [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=72.12s)]
*  for work they already completed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=77.84s)]
*  So the US Department of Agriculture has funding tied up in the Inflation Reduction Act, which [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  of course the Trump administration has put on freeze. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=86.88s)]
*  Now the Kansan named Bill Shaw has a contract worth $600,000 for rural energy development, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  and now he's pretty angry. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=99.98s)]
*  So he says the following, now that the USDA is telling me I may not get paid and I don't [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=101.5s)]
*  understand how that's possible. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=107.2s)]
*  If I have a contract with the government, they hold me to it, I'm doing the same. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  So look, there have been allegations that all of these town hall people who are showing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=116.84s)]
*  up and protesting are just paid protesters. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=123.84s)]
*  But let's also keep it real. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people who voted for Trump and a lot of Republicans are being impacted by these [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  cuts. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=134.68s)]
*  And now they're starting to speak up more and more. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=135.68s)]
*  Other constituents, including many at this town hall meeting, were concerned about reports [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=138.12s)]
*  that veterans have been among the federal workers who are getting fired. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  The exact number hasn't been confirmed by the Trump administration, but it is estimated [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  that nearly 6,000 veterans have been laid off from the federal workforce. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=152.12s)]
*  And the Department of Veterans Affairs has also been making cuts. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=156.32s)]
*  And VA employees at Topeka, Kansas, hospital were among those who were fired. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=160.56s)]
*  But Marshall apparently couldn't handle the heat from his own constituents and ran away [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=166.72s)]
*  like a little bitch. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=171.4s)]
*  A huge percentage of those people are veterans. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=172.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  And that is a damn shame. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  That is a damn shame. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm not a Democrat, but I'm worried about the veterans, man. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, I yielded to one of my elders and I appreciate his comments. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  I think it's a great, I'm not gonna, we don't have time for everyone to stand up. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=194.28s)]
*  I do got two more commitments today. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  I hope everybody make them to drive out and God bless America. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=200.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=203.76s)]
*  We're gonna take pictures with you, buddy, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=204.76s)]
*  So he ends this town hall early. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  Keep in mind that there were people who drove in from like four hours away. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=222.84s)]
*  And we're gonna hear from one of those people in just a moment. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=228.02s)]
*  But Cenk, I wanted to give you an opportunity to weigh in. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=231.02s)]
*  Look, I know that sometimes there's folks who are sent in to create trouble for the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=233.62s)]
*  legislators. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=240.54000000000002s)]
*  And right wing basically started this a long time ago. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  It's called AstroTurf. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=246.3s)]
*  The Koch brothers used to send buses around to pick up people, give them donuts, etc. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  To drive them to Democratic town halls and say, okay, and they'd have the hilarious signs, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  get your government hands off my Medicare. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=260.1s)]
*  Okay, so this has been around for a long time. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=262.74s)]
*  Democrats do it too, absolutely. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=265.82s)]
*  Even I mean, weirdo agitators do it from time to time. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=268.86s)]
*  There was this couple of guys who did it to AOC in a way that made no sense at all. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  And as soon as I saw them, I was like, yeah, those guys aren't real at all. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=277.82s)]
*  And then you found out of course there was some activist group, etc. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=281.46s)]
*  They were purposely trying to agitate her. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=284.9s)]
*  So in this case, look, I can't tell if everybody there is a Democrat or Republican, etc. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=287.2s)]
*  Of course, I wasn't there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=293.34s)]
*  But you really felt that guy was a paid agitator? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=295.7s)]
*  It didn't look like it, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=298.78s)]
*  And the guy in the corner say, I'm not a Democrat, but how about veterans? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=300.7s)]
*  That's not usually how those activists sound, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  So are there people who are really mad about people they know being fired and preemptive [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=308.3s)]
*  like without even asking? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=313.7s)]
*  Hey, what's your job? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  Does it make sense? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=316.74s)]
*  Should we get rid of that? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=317.74s)]
*  No, just fire, fire, fire, fire. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=318.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, of course, there's gonna be people in the middle of Kansas that are upset about [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=320.62s)]
*  that, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=323.62s)]
*  And the fact that it's affecting veterans more than anyone else makes people doubly [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=324.62s)]
*  mad. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=328.06s)]
*  That's the least surprising thing in the world. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=329.06s)]
*  But hey, Republicans, ignore your voters all you want. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=331.26s)]
*  It's easy to have it, cuz that usually has a way of catching up with you, just ask the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=336.74s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=340.62s)]
*  Now Colin McRoberts is one of the individuals who actually drove four hours to attend this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=341.62s)]
*  town hall and said that he found out about the event on Reddit. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=347.42s)]
*  So here's his account of what happened. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=351.52s)]
*  We kind of got the impression that the senator did not want people to come to the town hall, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=354.54s)]
*  which made me think it might be a particularly interesting thing to go to. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=357.78000000000003s)]
*  McRoberts said when he arrived, they had to move to a larger space. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=360.66s)]
*  There definitely seemed to be a lot of veterans there and even more people who were concerned [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=364.22s)]
*  about veterans, and particularly in the context of the firings of massive numbers of federal [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=366.94000000000005s)]
*  workers, a lot of whom are veterans. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=371.14000000000004s)]
*  We heard some questions about that, in particular the gentleman who spoke at the very end, the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=372.94000000000005s)]
*  last question Marshall took and the one that seemed to send him out of the room. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=376.38000000000005s)]
*  That was a surprise to everyone, I think to the point that no one really knew what was [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=379.42s)]
*  happening until he was out of the room and somebody started to yell, why are you leaving, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  where are you going? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=386.38000000000005s)]
*  You've got 20 minutes left, and it was a very quick exit. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=387.38000000000005s)]
*  Well, not only was it a quick exit, the senator took it upon himself to trash the town hall [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=390.66s)]
*  goers and refer to them as one of the rudest audiences he ever had. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=396.94s)]
*  Almost, I mean, almost as if his constituents are supposed to serve him. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  He's the senator of this state. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=406.98s)]
*  He's a public servant. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=409.34000000000003s)]
*  It is his job to answer their questions in regard to what's transpiring in the federal [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=410.54s)]
*  government. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=414.5s)]
*  And now Marshall and other Republicans have come up with basically an excuse for why constituents [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=416.3s)]
*  are confronting them at these town halls. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=422.5s)]
*  And it goes along what you had mentioned, Cenk. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=424.42s)]
*  They're just kind of brushing them off as members of an AstroTurf campaign. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=426.98s)]
*  So here's what Roger Marshall responded to when Trump posted, paid troublemakers are [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=432.42s)]
*  attending Republican town hall meetings. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=439.34000000000003s)]
*  It is all part of the game for the Democrats, but just like our big landslide election, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  it's not going to work for them. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=447.3s)]
*  Senator Marshall agrees and says can confirm. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=449.66s)]
*  But honestly, what is the truth? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=452.22s)]
*  While some Democratic groups have encouraged activists to attend these town halls to protest, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=454.18s)]
*  lawmakers have acknowledged at least some of the attendees are their constituents, and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=459.94s)]
*  there's no evidence any attendees were paid. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=465.02s)]
*  And so look, I mean, honestly, it's common sense. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=467.94s)]
*  Do you think Republican voters want to see their Social Security benefits taken away [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=470.74s)]
*  through the dismantling of the Social Security Administration, which the Trump administration [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=475.86s)]
*  is currently in the process of doing? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=479.98s)]
*  Do you think that Republican voters want government programs that they have paid into with their [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=482.14s)]
*  tax dollars to just go away based on what Elon Musk wants? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=488.54s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=493.1s)]
*  And by the way, a lot of veterans are Republicans. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=495.34000000000003s)]
*  So they get fired from their federal jobs out of no fault of their own. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=498.42s)]
*  They're gonna be upset. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=503.14000000000004s)]
*  Their family members who are probably Republicans as well are gonna be upset. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  This, I mean, come on, let's just keep it real. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=507.62s)]
*  So yeah, there are gonna be Democrats who take advantage of this for their own political [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=510.64000000000004s)]
*  purposes. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=514.1800000000001s)]
*  But I have no doubt that there are Republican voters who don't like what's going on right [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=515.1800000000001s)]
*  now. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=518.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, pride comes before the fall. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=519.3000000000001s)]
*  And we got a lot of pride here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=522.1800000000001s)]
*  Trump's saying, we want a landslide. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=524.62s)]
*  Look, brother, I know, I get it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=526.22s)]
*  We do marketing. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=527.7s)]
*  You keep telling everybody how great you are. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=528.7s)]
*  Believe me, we all got it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=531.0600000000001s)]
*  You won by one and a half points, the popular vote, which for a Republican is kind of extraordinary. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=532.96s)]
*  So that's what I've been warning the Democrats about and how at least he figured out that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=537.62s)]
*  you're supposed to pretend to be a populist, etc. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=543.9000000000001s)]
*  And he caught a wave, and that was a smart thing to do to catch that wave. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=546.5200000000001s)]
*  He never intended it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=550.12s)]
*  So now that's why we're now talking about cutting Social Security. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=551.44s)]
*  And by the way, did he run the campaign on cutting the living crap out of the government? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=554.86s)]
*  No, in fact, he disavowed Project 2025, which was all about cutting the living crap out [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=558.86s)]
*  of the government. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=564.0200000000001s)]
*  And he ran the campaign on inflation, which he's now doing either nothing about on eggs. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=565.0200000000001s)]
*  He said, so what? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=569.62s)]
*  That happens. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=571.1s)]
*  There's nothing I could do about it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=572.1s)]
*  So you sound like a Democrat, right? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=573.4200000000001s)]
*  And then he said, and he ran it on immigration. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=575.58s)]
*  Okay, he did those flashy raids in the beginning. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=578.5s)]
*  But overall, he's done nothing on the economy, and he might make inflation worse. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=584.7s)]
*  And now they're going, we want to know that instead, we're going to be all right. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=589.34s)]
*  Soon what they're going to be saying is, the polls don't matter. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=593.1400000000001s)]
*  Once you got it one side saying polls don't matter, that means they're on their way to [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=596.74s)]
*  oblivion, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=599.62s)]
*  You saw it, Biden bragging about, and in fact, we showed it to you on Friday's show. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=600.62s)]
*  One of Biden's staffers said, hey, when we were winning in 2020, we kept talking about [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=605.7800000000001s)]
*  it, the polls, the polls, the polls, the polls are on our side, we're going to win, we're [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=609.82s)]
*  so good, right? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=612.9000000000001s)]
*  When we were losing in 2024, and it became clear that we had no chance of winning, we're [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=614.38s)]
*  like, the polls, the leadership in the Biden campaign were like, the polls don't matter, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=619.26s)]
*  the polls don't matter, etc. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=623.14s)]
*  And all of a sudden, the polls were all wrong. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=625.14s)]
*  That's what people do when they're in a bubble. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=627.26s)]
*  So right now, the Republicans are in a bubble, think that they're untouchable, and that 80% [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=629.58s)]
*  of the country's on their side. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=633.78s)]
*  No, barely a majority was on your side at your height. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=636.14s)]
*  And now that you're doing unpopular things, you will start to lose them more and more. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=641.36s)]
*  But there's gonna be a tipping point, we're not at the tipping point. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  Right now, Trump and Musk's popularity are being chipped away at. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=647.84s)]
*  Bigger chunks coming out of Elon Musk's popularity, Trump is still hanging in there for the moment [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=652.08s)]
*  being, but remember, he just took charge, right? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=656.84s)]
*  I mean, he basically just, it's only been 45 days. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=659.96s)]
*  But these cuts and this reckless behavior is definitely going to catch up to the Trump [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=664.0400000000001s)]
*  to them. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=671.28s)]
*  Their polls will plummet and then they'll turn around and say, a polls don't matter. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=672.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, they're gonna have to find a way to justify spending $100 billion in taxpayer [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=675.9599999999999s)]
*  money to buy crypto for the US crypto reserve while gutting the federal government of veterans, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=682.4s)]
*  okay? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  People who risk their lives to defend the country and then essentially get fleeced by [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=691.0799999999999s)]
*  our current government and get fired from their jobs, it's disgusting. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=696.36s)]
*  So that's what's currently transpiring, and so we'll see how that plays out. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=700.6s)]
*  But I wanted to give you some more details on the polling here. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=704.2s)]
*  Because look, Republicans are right that most Americans wanna get rid of waste and abuse [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=707.88s)]
*  in the federal government. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=712.3000000000001s)]
*  There is bloat in the federal government. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=713.32s)]
*  I say it, you say it, we all agree that that exists. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=714.72s)]
*  But again, where are the priorities here? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=718.2s)]
*  What are they cutting and how are they cutting? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=720.32s)]
*  And that's a completely different question, right? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=723.36s)]
*  So a recent Harvard Harris poll found that eliminating fraud and waste in government [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=725.6s)]
*  expenditures had 76% support among Americans. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=729.6s)]
*  That's a no-brainer. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=733.48s)]
*  Of course, Americans wanna get rid of that abuse. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=734.48s)]
*  But they also have serious concerns about the mass firings and funding freezes in the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=736.9200000000001s)]
*  federal government as well. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=741.0s)]
*  In a recent CNN poll, 51% of respondents said that Trump had gone too far cutting federal [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  programs. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=748.0400000000001s)]
*  And also, they have concerns about Doge and Elon Musk specifically. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  So in the latest Economist YouGov poll conducted February 23rd through 25th, respondents were [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=755.14s)]
*  asked whether they were concerned that Musk was using Doge to benefit himself and his [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=761.5400000000001s)]
*  companies. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=766.5400000000001s)]
*  Only 30% said they were not too concerned or not concerned at all, while nearly 6 in [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=767.5400000000001s)]
*  10 Americans, 57%, said they were somewhat or very concerned. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=774.78s)]
*  In a February 13th through 18th Washington Post Ipsos poll, a net 34% of respondents [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=779.62s)]
*  said they approved of how Musk was handling his job, compared with 49% disapproving and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=787.0600000000001s)]
*  14% reporting that they're unsure. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=793.5s)]
*  And a YouGov survey presented respondents with a list of agencies and departments asking [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=796.5s)]
*  whether they should be expanded, kept the same, or reduced or eliminated. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=803.12s)]
*  Out of all the agencies, Doge received the highest share of eliminated answers at 29%. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=808.02s)]
*  Okay, that's a hilarious poll. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=815.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't want you to miss what that poll is saying. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=818.26s)]
*  They're saying, okay, look, they're looking to cut these different departments, Department [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=820.66s)]
*  of Education, etc., etc. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=823.78s)]
*  Which department should be cut the most? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=826.4200000000001s)]
*  And the number one answer was Doge, the one cutting all the other departments. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=828.86s)]
*  That's the one that should be cut. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=833.1s)]
*  Hey, F around and find out. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=835.0600000000001s)]
*  So one last thing here, guys. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=838.5s)]
*  You see that number where they're worried that he's serving his own interests and not [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=840.98s)]
*  our interests about Elon Musk. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=844.58s)]

*  Yes, it is. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=847.78s)]

*  My God. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=883.62s)]
*  Okay, so Starlink, of course, owned by Elon Musk. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQ-0HyH4M&t=884.9s)]
