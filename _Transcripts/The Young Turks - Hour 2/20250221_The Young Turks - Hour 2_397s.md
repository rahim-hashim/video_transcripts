"President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a "DOGE dividend."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Is Trump Considering A "DOGE Dividend?"
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A)
*  We're $37 trillion in debt, which is why our proposal calls for 80% of that going to pay [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=0.0s)]
*  down the debt and only 20% going directly to taxpayers. Let's not forget, this isn't [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  a handout. This was taxpayers money that was sent to DC in the first place. It was sent [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=10.48s)]
*  to DC to support Americans. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=15.5s)]
*  So that was James Fishback, the so-called architect of the so-called Doge Dividend. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=17.96s)]
*  Fishback tweeted to Elon Musk and Trump on Tuesday, saying that they should announce [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  the Doge Dividend, a tax refund check sent to every taxpayer funded exclusively with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=28.2s)]
*  a portion of the total savings delivered by Doge. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=33.72s)]
*  Cenk, at least the name's catchy. What do you think? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=36.92s)]
*  Yeah, there is precedent for this and I think that it actually can work. But it comes with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  giant butts and we'll talk about why we don't think it is going to work. By the way, we [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=47.36s)]
*  have a poll on whether you think you'll ever get a dime from it. Yes, back to you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=51.24s)]
*  It does have giant butts associated with it. Elon Musk thought it was a good idea though [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=55.88s)]
*  when he read about it on X. So he responded with, we'll check with the president. Since [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=60.6s)]
*  then the gang has all gathered at CPAC and the Doge Dividend has already gained plenty [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=65.76s)]
*  of traction. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=70.30000000000001s)]
*  Unsurprisingly, it's wildly popular among Trump supporters who think that they're gonna [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  get a fat check from the government. Or perhaps it is surprising since they don't love handouts. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  But as you heard Fishback say in the clip, this is not a handout. A friendly reminder [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=80.04s)]
*  though that neither Trump nor Elon has told us exactly what kind of fraud has been committed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=84.92s)]
*  with the money that they're saying they're going to discover and give back to the people [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=89.2s)]
*  from the government. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=94.48s)]
*  And it's just that fraud is scary and they wanna get rid of all the money. So regardless, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=96.12s)]
*  I would be very surprised if those checks ever did materialize. But first, here are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=100.36s)]
*  some of the specifics. This would be less like a stimulus check and more like a tax [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=104.26s)]
*  refund. They'd be giving millions of presumably tax paying Americans checks of around $5,000 [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  or maybe up to $8,000 per household. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  This money would come from 20% of the $2 trillion that Doge will eventually siphon away from [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  various portions of our government. And also there was a reference to $55 billion that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=123.4s)]
*  Doge has already cut from the government spending. I don't think it was in that clip that we [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  just showed you, but he did mention it later on in that segment with Chris Cuomo. $55 billion [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  that number is actually unaccounted for. According to the totals on the Doge website, only a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=140.76s)]
*  fraction of that amount has actually been cut to date. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=145.12s)]
*  But we've already seen plenty of federal workers laid off and government run programs cut or [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=148.56s)]
*  significantly reduced. So at CPAC, Trump told people that he was considering the rebates, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=153.14s)]
*  but House Speaker Johnson pushed back while acknowledging that the optics of something [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=159.32s)]
*  like this would be great for the Republican Party. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  He said, politically, it would be great for us. That's our brand and we have a $36 trillion [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=166.32s)]
*  federal debt. We have a giant deficit that we're contending with. I think we need to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=171.84s)]
*  pay down the credit card, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=176.0s)]
*  Elon Musk, however, did not like that response. So he later said, I told the president he's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=179.04s)]
*  supportive of that, though it sounds like something we're going to do. So we've got [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=184.0s)]
*  Elon Musk functioning as our de facto president here. He said he's going to ask Trump to do [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=188.44s)]
*  the rebates, but he's the one speaking as if it's going to happen. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=193.12s)]
*  When Speaker Johnson pushed back against it, Elon all but completely dismissed him. Elon [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=196.76s)]
*  doesn't care whether or not he has congressional approval for something like this either because [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=201.4s)]
*  Elon Musk functions outside of our government. So this is a giant economic package that they're [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=205.12s)]
*  talking about. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=210.4s)]
*  And this whole conversation just started because someone tweeted at Elon Musk. And that in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=211.4s)]
*  and of itself is problematic. But giant economic decisions usually don't get made this flippantly. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  This has got to be like a PR move or something, it seems. Because Republicans, from what I've [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=221.44s)]
*  seen at least, they are already all over social media talking about what they're going to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=226.52s)]
*  do with this money that they feel the government owes them. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=230.76s)]
*  And we all know that if you give an American voter $5,000, you will have their unwavering [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=234.0s)]
*  loyalty and support because we are easily bought. Cenk, are we holding our breath for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=238.92s)]
*  this money to come through? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=244.28s)]
*  Yeah, look, if they were smart, they would actually do it. And I'd be in favor of it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=245.72s)]
*  And I'll tell you why in a sec. So yeah, first of all, if you send American people any kind [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=249.44s)]
*  of check, they're gonna love it. It's smart political strategy. And then they're gonna [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=254.68s)]
*  love that you cut things because they're gonna think, I got money from those cuts. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=259.56s)]
*  Now you should be asking, where's the other 80% going? Well, the other 80% is not going [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=264.56s)]
*  to go to savings. It's not going to pay down the debt. Donald Trump last time increased [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=269.88s)]
*  the debt by $8.4 trillion. It's going to go to corporate tax cuts. So that's why if they're [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=273.4s)]
*  gonna send us 20%, take it off the table. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=281.12s)]
*  Take it, take it, take it, right? Because if you don't take it, it's just gonna go to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  more tax cuts for wealthy people. And so they're gonna waste. So far the amount of cuts they've [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=287.12s)]
*  made is, and it's not just me saying it, Steve Bannon has said it, microscopic. Because there [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=293.44s)]
*  isn't two trillion to cut. There isn't one trillion to cut. The minute you started cutting [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=300.84s)]
*  anything, everybody was like, what are you doing cutting cancer research and firing all [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=305.2s)]
*  these poor people and veterans and stuff? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  Because the American people don't want that. There isn't those cuts. They're doing all [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=310.28s)]
*  of this as marketing for their giant corporate tax cuts where they're gonna take most of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  the money. There is one instance where this did work. I mentioned it earlier in the show, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  Sarah Palin did a deal with the oil companies that were drilling in Alaska. And she made [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  them give some portion of the proceeds to the citizens of Alaska. I love that. You could [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  do that with the $30 billion in oil subsidies that we give out every year to the oil companies. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=332.32s)]
*  But those are honest programs, even the Palin one. These are not. So I'd be surprised if [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  we got the money. I'd be kind of happy if we got the money, but the rest will very likely [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=342.42s)]
*  go to the super rich. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=346.52000000000004s)]
*  All right, last word is to Mark. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  I would agree with absolutely every breath of what Cenk just said, including the Palin [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=350.76s)]
*  plan where Americans can derive some benefit from the wanton exploitation of open lands [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=357.48s)]
*  everywhere in this country for fossil fuel exploitation. Brother Cenk said, I'm with [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=364.72s)]
*  you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfKqbVXFB8A&t=370.64s)]
