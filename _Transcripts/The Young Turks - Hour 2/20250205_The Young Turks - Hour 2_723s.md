The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Painfully Cringe Chuck Schumer Video Breaks CNN Panel
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q)
*  We will win. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  We will win. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=1.74s)]
*  We will win. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=3.6s)]
*  We won't rest. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=5.36s)]
*  We won't rest. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=7.32s)]
*  So they need the Democrats. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=9.0s)]
*  The Democrats need a real leader. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  Are you fired up after this? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=15.68s)]
*  I'm fired up and ready to go. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=17.72s)]
*  Can't you see it in my face? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=19.0s)]
*  For me, I'm disappointed in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=20.48s)]
*  the lack of plan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=22.8s)]
*  I'm disappointed in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=24.84s)]
*  the flat footedness. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=26.38s)]
*  I don't want to hear Chuck Schumer [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  saying, and we won't lose and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=31.0s)]
*  we won't rest. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=33.12s)]
*  Yeah, because they have lost. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=36.96s)]
*  They lost big. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=39.48s)]
*  And part of the reason why they [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  lost is because there wasn't [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=41.76s)]
*  a plan to begin with. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=42.92s)]
*  And I'm hoping that Bakari Sellers [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=44.2s)]
*  finally realizes that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=46.0s)]
*  Now Chuck Schumer, the leader, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=47.16s)]
*  if you want to call it that, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  of the Senate Democrats, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=50.8s)]
*  is so embarrassing that even [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=52.36s)]
*  typical gung-ho, ra-ra-go Democrats [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  panelists on CNN just really [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=56.76s)]
*  couldn't root for him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=58.56s)]
*  Congressional Democrats held [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=60.12s)]
*  a rally yesterday to protest [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=61.8s)]
*  Elon Musk's influence over Donald [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=63.32s)]
*  Trump, his presidency, and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=65.36s)]
*  the entire federal government, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=67.08s)]
*  which is a valid concern. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=69.12s)]
*  It's just that the opposition [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=70.72s)]
*  party doesn't really seem well [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=72.52s)]
*  equipped to deal with this or [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=74.4s)]
*  respond to it effectively. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=76.2s)]
*  But among the speakers was Chuck [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=78.12s)]
*  Schumer, who as usual was painfully [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=80.36s)]
*  cringey and unconvincing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  Are we not going to rest till we [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=85.76s)]
*  win? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=87.64s)]
*  Let me say first some good news. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=88.2s)]
*  Every one of the 47 Democratic [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  senators is going to vote against [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  that horrible, dangerous man, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=96.72s)]
*  Russell Doak, on Wednesday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  And we cannot allow Elon Musk and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=102.16s)]
*  a small group of people who are [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  not going to vote for him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  We cannot allow him to vote for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk and a small group of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=114.6s)]
*  people to secretly behind closed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=117.0s)]
*  doors, take away our privacy, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=119.88s)]
*  take away our dollars, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=122.56s)]
*  take away everything we have. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=124.48s)]
*  We are going to fight this fight. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=126.6s)]
*  I am going to stand with you in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=128.8s)]
*  this fight, and we will win. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=130.56s)]
*  We will win. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=132.32s)]

*  We won't rest. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=146.2s)]
*  We won't rest. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=147.92s)]
*  We won't rest. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=149.88s)]
*  Okay, all right, just a few things. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=151.2s)]
*  Elon Musk isn't doing any of this [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  secretly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=158.64s)]
*  Okay, it's pretty public. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=159.2s)]
*  It's been dominating the new cycle. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=160.64s)]
*  And look, the person in the frame [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=162.24s)]
*  waving a literal cane around while [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=165.48s)]
*  this chant is going on, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=168.72s)]
*  not great optics wise, not good [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  when the party's trying to portray [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=174.2s)]
*  energy in a vision. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  But look, I personally think that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=178.32s)]
*  this is the result of the Democratic [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=181.56s)]
*  Party leaning too heavily on Trump [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  bad as their campaign strategy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=188.0s)]
*  Okay, because when you just rely on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=190.64s)]
*  that and you don't think you need [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=193.04s)]
*  to strategize, be methodical, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  offer voters something, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=197.72s)]
*  you're going to find yourself in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=200.0s)]
*  the position you're in right now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=201.72s)]
*  Where not only is the executive [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  branch controlled by Donald Trump [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=204.84s)]
*  and the Republicans, but obviously [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=206.72s)]
*  Republicans control Congress. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  They have a majority in the Senate. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  All you need is a simple majority [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=212.24s)]
*  to confirm Donald Trump's nominees. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  Russell vote will definitely get [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  nominated, confirmed I should say. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  So when he mentions the 47 [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  Democrats in the Senate who plan to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=222.88s)]
*  vote against him, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  that's all fine and dandy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  But that's not really going to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=226.72s)]
*  matter if every single Republican [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=228.4s)]
*  votes to confirm him. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=230.4s)]
*  And of course, the House is also [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=233.16000000000003s)]
*  controlled by the Republicans. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=234.44000000000003s)]
*  So I just think right now Democrats [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=235.52s)]
*  are in a really bad place and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=237.84s)]
*  what they should be focusing on is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE1XoAl-0Q&t=239.64000000000001s)]
