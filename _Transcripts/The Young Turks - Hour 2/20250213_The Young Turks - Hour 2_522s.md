"Republicans are considering doing away with one of Wall Street‚Äôs favorite tax breaks at the encouragement of President Trump, one that has long enjoyed Republican support and that could put up yet another obstacle on the road to a tax bill.

The tax break on carried interest ‚Äî often called the carried interest loophole ‚Äî allows the managers of investment funds such as private equity firms and hedge funds to count their income as capital gains and thereby have it be subject to a lower tax rate."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Cenk and Ana STUNNED by Unbelievable Republican Proposal
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q)
*  By the way, Chris and Sinema came out, the only part of that bill I liked at all was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  the tax on carried interest. And Sinema came out last night and said the one change she [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  has to have is no, hey, no offense, Sinema's gone full hedge fund, full VC, right? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Steve Bannon happens to be one of those rare conservatives that has four years spoken out [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  against the carried interest loophole, which is a major gift to the wealthy, a major tax break for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=23.439999999999998s)]
*  the wealthy. But in recent days, more members of the Republican Party have actually started to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=30.8s)]
*  line up behind Bannon on this issue. Now, why? Well, the White House press secretary, Caroline [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=37.92s)]
*  Levitt has repeatedly stated that President Donald Trump wants the carried interest loophole [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=45.04s)]
*  to be scrapped as part of a sweeping tax bill. And before I give you the details, Cenk, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=51.92s)]
*  how much do you believe this? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=59.92s)]
*  Well, there's really good reason not to believe it and we'll share that with you as well. But [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=62.08s)]
*  as usual, there's plenty of blame to go around for both parties in this. That's why it's been [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=66.48s)]
*  around for decades. Definitely. So look, in case you're not familiar with what the loophole does, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  I don't blame you. I too am not wealthy and I too do not benefit from the carried interest loophole. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=78.08s)]
*  But basically, it allows hedge funds and private equity firms to classify a part of their income [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=83.52s)]
*  as capital gains, which are unfairly taxed at a much lower rate than general income, right? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=90.0s)]
*  So carried interest refers to the income that investment managers collect from their funds, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=97.12s)]
*  which is typically 20% of profits. Under current tax law, that income is taxed as a capital gain, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=103.44s)]
*  which has a top tax rate of 20% for long term gains versus the highest rate of 37% [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=111.6s)]
*  for regular income, such as the money that workers receive in their paychecks. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=119.92s)]
*  So shockingly, several Republican lawmakers told The Hill that they support Donald Trump's plan [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=124.88s)]
*  to scrap that tax break. Here's Representative Dan Muser, who says that Trump thinks it's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=131.52s)]
*  a little unfair that one sector of industry gains a lot by using carried interest as part of their [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=138.24s)]
*  income and paying lower capital gains. President Trump doesn't wanna see anything perceived as [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  unfair. That's kind of a funny line, but nonetheless, certainly for the wealthy, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=150.8s)]
*  he wants to make sure that all of America gets the benefit of his tax bill. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=155.52s)]
*  And I agree with him, and he's not the only Republican. Let's go to Republican Congressman [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=160.32s)]
*  Rick Allen, who says, we get accused of just looking after the wealthy. Well, that's for [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=165.28s)]
*  good reason, but let me continue with his statement. And this would include the wealthy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=171.28s)]
*  With the momentum in the country, I don't think folks will mind paying a little more to make sure [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=176.48s)]
*  we get this done. Senator John Kennedy, though, is a little bit on the fence, a little iffy on [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=182.48s)]
*  this whole notion. He says, I haven't made a decision about carried interest. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=189.12s)]
*  I know the way it works. Frankly, there are good arguments on both sides. If we end up needing the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=194.0s)]
*  money, could I vote to get rid of carried interest? Yeah, I could. But before we get too excited, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=200.96s)]
*  I do wanna remind you all that in the first debate in regard to Donald Trump's 2017 tax bill, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=208.56s)]
*  there was a lot of talk about doing away with corporate tax loopholes and other various [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=216.8s)]
*  deductions that the rich get to take advantage of. These types of deductions and loopholes [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  effectively allow for incredibly successful and profitable corporations to get away with paying [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=228.0s)]
*  zero in federal taxes. And so when all was said and done, they did not get rid of those deductions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  They didn't get rid of the carried interest loophole. All of that remained in effect. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=242.32s)]
*  Like in effect, the only thing that we got out of that tax bill were tax cuts. The majority of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=247.6s)]
*  those tax cuts did benefit corporations and the wealthy. Yes, there were some working class people [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=253.28s)]
*  who benefited from those tax breaks as well, but certainly not to the same extent, Cenk. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=258.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I wanna explain to you guys why this is so unfair. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=262.79999999999995s)]
*  So your income, whether you're a doctor, accountant, etc., gets taxed at 37%, as Ana explained. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=265.91999999999996s)]
*  The hedge fund guys, the private equity guys, by the way, the richest people in the world [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=275.2s)]
*  that are doing the investments for other incredibly wealthy people, they're not investing their money. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=279.84s)]
*  If they're investing their money, they get capital gains. I don't even think capital gains [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  tax being at 20% is fair, but that's where it is. But in this case, they're investing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=289.36s)]
*  other people's money and they're getting income for it, salary for it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=294.16s)]
*  There's no reason why that shouldn't be 37%. And they're like, no, just cuz they're bankers, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=298.48s)]
*  it gets to be 20%. It's just cheating. It's totally utterly cheating. And both sides know it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  And both sides love it. So that's why the Democrats are really against the carried [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  interest loophole. Golly gee, Chris, the cinema voted against it. And Schumer in his quote at [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=317.12s)]
*  the time about it said, well, there was nothing we could do. Of course, they always say there's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=324.64s)]
*  nothing they can do, right? And by the way, if it wasn't cinema, it would have been mansion. If [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=330.88s)]
*  it wasn't mansion, it would have been Coons. Why do you think it's been around for decade after [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=334.96s)]
*  decade, no matter if it was a Democratic president or a Republican president? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=339.52s)]
*  If you think the Democrats really wanted to get rid of it, why didn't they get rid of it when Obama [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=342.96s)]
*  had his super majority? Why didn't they do almost anything when Obama had a super majority? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=346.72s)]
*  Imagine if Trump had a super majority where he didn't have to worry about the filibuster. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=351.68s)]
*  They would have changed every law in the country by now, right? But the Democrats were like, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=355.68s)]
*  there's nothing we could do. There's everything you could do. And they didn't do it on purpose, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=359.36s)]
*  okay? So they're gigantic liars. Now, how about Republicans? Since everybody in the country has [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  binary brain, that must mean the Republicans are angels, right? No, the Republicans are even worse [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=369.68s)]
*  on this. Why does cinema's vote matter? Cuz every Republican voted no. Every Republican was like, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=374.32s)]
*  well, of course, private equity and hedge fund managers cheating. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=381.36s)]
*  And then you guys have to pay higher taxes to make up for it, the average American. Obviously, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=385.2s)]
*  you're not my donor. Those guys are my donors. So every Republican senator is a total and utter [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=390.4s)]
*  crook on this issue. That's why you see them going, I mean, if Trump makes us, I guess I'll [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=396.0s)]
*  have to consider it, but I really don't want to. Those guys are so good with bribes, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=400.96s)]
*  And Trump, last time, I'm gonna get rid of all the loopholes. I'm gonna get rid of carried [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=407.12s)]
*  into loopholes, just like he's doing now. And when it came time to cut the taxes, they're like, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=411.84s)]
*  chop it, chop it. 35% for corporate tax, bring it all the way down to 21. The Democrats [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  secretly agree with us. It'll be easy to pass. Well, how about all those loopholes you said [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=424.24s)]
*  you were gonna take away? That's for suckers. We just say that for marketing, right? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=428.32s)]
*  Look, if they pass Trump's new tax cut proposal, it would cost us at least $4 trillion. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=433.2s)]
*  And unbiased groups have already done the math on it. In that new one, middle income Americans [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=442.08s)]
*  and poor Americans will see their taxes actively go up, not down. Your taxes would go up. And then [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=449.44s)]
*  if at the end, they're like, all right, now we chopped down the corporate tax rate from 21% to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  15%. But we took away the carried interest loophole. Brother, you just put a $4 trillion hole in the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=461.84s)]
*  debt and you're making us pay higher taxes. So that just taking away this one loophole [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=467.76s)]
*  is not good enough. That's just marketing. But very likely, they won't even do that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=473.52s)]
*  It's just marketing ahead of time to get people to say, well, look at Trump being a populist hero. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=479.68s)]
*  He's gonna get rid of the carried interest loophole. Steve Bannon agrees. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=485.04s)]
*  It's like, believe it or not, I actually believe Steve Bannon, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  cuz he's been consistent on this. I don't believe Trump at all. I think he's totally lying. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  And if history is any guide, he'll screw you again on behalf of his corporate donors, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=496.0s)]
*  just like he did last time. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kydfpcBoF2Q&t=501.04s)]
