Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# SCOTUS Gives The American People A Rare WIN
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4)
*  Yesterday, the Supreme Court declined to take up a case by top Republican donor and Las [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=0.0s)]
*  Vegas billionaire Steve Wynn to challenge protections the press has. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Namely, protections against powerful people like him suing after they accurately report [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  stories that he doesn't like. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Now, Wynn asked the court to overturn the 1964 Supreme Court defamation ruling in New [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=19.8s)]
*  York Times v Sullivan, which concluded that there must be evidence of actual malice for [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=26.74s)]
*  a public figure to pursue a defamation claim. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=32.42s)]
*  Now, actual malice is an important requirement in defamation suits. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=41.46s)]
*  Because you have to prove that the individual that you're accusing of defaming you did so [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=42.46s)]
*  intentionally out of malice. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=48.58s)]
*  They intentionally lied about you to destroy your character and reputation, and that that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=50.42s)]
*  led to damages which you're suing for. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=55.26s)]
*  That's how you win a defamation suit. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=57.86s)]
*  And that standard, again, became the standard as a result of that Times v Sullivan case. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=59.7s)]
*  Now, the ruling bolsters the press's ability to hold high powered individuals accountable [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=65.94s)]
*  without worrying about legal backlash. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=70.86s)]
*  And Wynn was requesting this case be challenged after he filed a lawsuit against the Associated [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=73.38s)]
*  Press back in 2018 after they reported allegations that he had allegedly engaged in sexual misconduct [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=79.98s)]
*  back in the 1970s. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=87.42s)]
*  Now in the article, AP's Regina Garcia Cano wrote about the contents of two police reports [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=89.5s)]
*  filed by two women that came out weeks after Wynn resigned as the CEO of Wynn Resorts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  In the AP report, they write that one police report obtained by the AP shows a woman told [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=104.22s)]
*  officers that Wynn raped her at least three times around 1973 and 1974 at her Chicago [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=109.46s)]
*  apartment. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=116.38s)]
*  She reported she got pregnant and gave birth to a girl in a gas station restroom. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=117.42s)]
*  The woman, the child of the accuser and Wynn, now lives in Las Vegas, according to the report. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=122.74s)]
*  And then in regard to the second report, let's talk a little bit about that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=129.66s)]
*  That shows a woman told police she had consensual sex with Wynn several times while she worked [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=132.62s)]
*  as a dealer at the downtown Las Vegas casino hotel Golden Nugget, but felt coerced to perform [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=138.7s)]
*  the acts. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=144.1s)]
*  She reported she was forced to resign when she turned him down. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  Additionally, these reports with the Associated Press came out after the Wall Street Journal [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=149.62s)]
*  reported other instances of alleged misconduct and a $7.5 million settlement that Wynn had [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=155.26s)]
*  paid as a result. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=161.98s)]
*  Now Wynn has consistently denied all the allegations. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=163.64s)]
*  That's why he pursued the defamation suit against the Associated Press. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=166.82s)]
*  Once he realized that proving actual malice is the standard and it's a difficult standard [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=171.34s)]
*  to fulfill, he decided to ask the Supreme Court to overturn Times v. Sullivan, but they [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=176.62s)]
*  have declined to do so. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  Okay, New York Times v. Sullivan is one of the more important cases, and almost everybody [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=184.06s)]
*  studies it in law school. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=189.1s)]
*  And the reason why it's so important is without that standard, then politicians and other [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=191.14s)]
*  powerful people can just intimidate the rest of us by filing lawsuits. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=196.3s)]
*  And you got something slightly wrong, and not just the public, but more importantly, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=201.38000000000002s)]
*  the publications of free press, which is guaranteed in the First Amendment, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=207.94s)]
*  Not just freedom of speech, but free press is guaranteed in the First Amendment. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=212.02s)]
*  So New York Times or whoever else got something slightly wrong, okay, give me a billion dollars [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=215.9s)]
*  out, you're out of business. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=221.22000000000003s)]
*  Anyone who dares to criticize any politician, we sue you, you're out of business, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=222.66s)]
*  And even if you don't win, you put on a ton of costs for those people. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=227.38s)]
*  And now Musk and Trump have realized that they're doing the same exact trick. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=231.74s)]
*  So if Steve Wynn had won this case, then we'd all be in a world of trouble. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=236.06s)]
*  Because that would mean that Trump and Musk would be able to sue everyone into intimidation [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  and bullying and bankruptcy, etc. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=248.9s)]
*  So the fact that he did not win and the Supreme Court rejected it is excellent news. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=252.3s)]
*  In a time of bad, one bad news after another after another, the fact that the courts are [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=258.22s)]
*  holding even a deeply conservative Supreme Court is excellent news for the country. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=263.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's the one area where things are still functional, which is, I guess, a good [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=269.74s)]
*  thing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=275.74s)]
*  Especially when you consider how utterly feckless Congress is, how useless Congress is. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=277.38s)]
*  That branch of government has effectively failed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=285.3s)]
*  And that's terrifying, because you need the three branches of government to check each [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=288.14s)]
*  other. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=291.82s)]
*  And right now, there is no checks and balances in regard to Congress, especially if the majority [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=292.82s)]
*  is held by the same party represented by the executive branch or the president. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=298.6s)]
*  Now Wynn consistently, again, denied all the allegations. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=303.46s)]
*  His attorneys argued that the story failed to fully describe elements of one allegation [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=306.26s)]
*  that would have cast doubt on the account. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=311.34s)]
*  But the Nevada Supreme Court upheld a ruling tossing out Wynn's lawsuit against the Associated [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=313.5s)]
*  Press, finding the news organization had published an article in a good faith effort to inform [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  their readers regarding an issue of clear public interest. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so look, the Steve Wynn thing from the 1970s, God bless, they adjudicated it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't have a strong opinion on that, I think we covered it a while back. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=332.18s)]
*  That's not the point of the story. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=336.26000000000005s)]
*  The point of the story is that this could have been a disaster if it went the other [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=337.38s)]
*  way. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=342.5s)]
*  And we're gonna tell you about Trump and Elon in a second, but I wanna tell you, I was just [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=343.5s)]
*  at the World Forum, that's part of the reason that I was away. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=346.1s)]
*  It was in Germany, and there I got to talk with the people that were in, there were dissidents [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=348.74s)]
*  at this point. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  The opposition leader of Russia, the former head of the Supreme Court in Hungary, a judge [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  who was driven from the country in Turkey, right, driven away by Erdogan's arrest of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=361.54s)]
*  his opponents, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=366.74s)]
*  And they all said the same things. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  The first thing that autocrats do is they go after the media. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=370.18s)]
*  The second thing that they go after is the courts. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=374.02000000000004s)]
*  And you see what is Trump and Elon doing? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=376.42s)]
*  They're going after the media. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=379.36s)]
*  And then when I asked them, as I was the moderator of those panels, I asked them questions about [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=382.26s)]
*  it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=387.14000000000004s)]
*  And the first thing they do is they threaten lawsuits and they threaten financial ruin [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=388.14s)]
*  for the media companies in order to gain control over the media companies. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=394.14s)]
*  And now we can tell you the rest of the story. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=398.26s)]
*  So recently, Trump's 2024 campaign manager, Chris LaCivita, filed a defamation suit against [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  the Daily Beast for what he alleges are fabricated claims about his campaign compensation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=408.38s)]
*  Now according to the court filing, the Daily Beast published multiple articles in 2024 [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=414.94s)]
*  suggesting that he had raked in huge payments, including a piece by the investigative journalist, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=419.02s)]
*  Michael Isikoff. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=425.42s)]
*  Well, Michael Isikoff is still around. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=426.42s)]
*  That was titled Trump in Cash Crisis as Campaign Chief's $22 million pay revealed. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=429.06s)]
*  Man, that's a lot of money. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=435.5s)]
*  Anyway, LaCivita alleges the reporting created a false impression that he was personally [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=437.3s)]
*  profiting excessively and prioritizing personal gain over campaign success, which they argue [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=441.7s)]
*  has harmed his personal reputation. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=446.82s)]
*  The lawsuit, which does not name Isikoff as a defendant, claims the multi-million dollar [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=449.38s)]
*  figure represents gross campaign advertising expenditures, not personal income. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=454.42s)]
*  So the Daily Beast did modify its reporting following initial correction demands, reducing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=460.32s)]
*  the amount from $22 million to $19.2 million and stating that the funds went to LaCivita's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=467.34s)]
*  consulting firm. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=474.98s)]
*  But then there's also Elon Musk. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=476.94s)]
*  So I just wanted to give you the LaCivita element, but Elon Musk is also threatening [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=478.46s)]
*  all sorts of lawsuits. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=481.94s)]
*  Last week on Abby Phillips's CNN show, ex-Squad member, Representative Jamal Bowman had some [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=483.2s)]
*  choice words for Elon Musk. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=489.58s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=490.94s)]
*  This shows again the American people do not trust Elon Musk, and Elon Musk is incompetent [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=492.94s)]
*  in his position. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=498.5s)]
*  And how do we know? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=499.5s)]
*  Cuz they fired tens of thousands of people, it was challenged in court. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=501.18s)]
*  The court said the people have to go back and now the people are coming back. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=504.86s)]
*  He's incompetent, he's a thief, he's a Nazi, and people don't trust him. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=508.52s)]
*  So Elon has threatened to take legal action against Jamal Bowman for what he said there. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=515.0s)]
*  Thomas Hearn writes on X, Jamal Bowman just called Elon Musk an incompetent thief and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=521.66s)]
*  Nazi. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=526.3399999999999s)]
*  And Elon Musk responded, I've had enough lawsuit inbound. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=527.86s)]
*  So this is a little different if you ask me because, look guys, I don't know if Elon Musk [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=531.1s)]
*  is gonna be able to win that lawsuit. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=538.74s)]
*  No chance he wins that lawsuit. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=540.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't know. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=543.14s)]
*  It's become very in vogue to go around calling people you don't like Nazis. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=544.9s)]
*  And first of all, it cheapens what it means, what that word means, number one, when you're [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=548.98s)]
*  just calling anyone and everyone that you don't like that word. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=553.66s)]
*  But yeah, anyway, I just think it's dumb. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=557.1800000000001s)]
*  Let's come up with actual substantive- [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=561.1s)]
*  I know, but that's not the point here. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=563.78s)]
*  So you could disagree with what Jamal Bowman said, you could disagree with Isacoff's reporting [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=565.46s)]
*  if you wanna talk about the Las Vegas case, etc. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=570.62s)]
*  So that's not the point. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=573.46s)]
*  The point is that if you then get to get millions of dollars from people for insults, and that's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=574.5400000000001s)]
*  all it is, it's an insult. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=581.86s)]
*  And so Elon Musk did what you can call a Roman salute or a Nazi salute. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=583.38s)]
*  And you could believe him that he didn't mean it, that he just happened to look just like [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=587.94s)]
*  the Nazi salute, whatever. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=594.1800000000001s)]
*  But we're not allowed to talk about that after he does it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=596.6600000000001s)]
*  What if we put on a swastika? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=600.22s)]
*  Are we still not allowed to call him a Nazi? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=602.0600000000001s)]
*  Is he still gonna sue us, right? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=603.74s)]
*  So the problem is the lawsuits, not the fact that I didn't like what Bowman said. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=605.7s)]
*  And now, of course, Donald Trump sued ABC, CBS, all these things. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=611.1s)]
*  He's looking for $10 billion from CBS. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=614.58s)]
*  Look, guys, if you can't criticize politicians or donors, there'll be no freedom left. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=617.46s)]
*  And that's what this is about. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=624.04s)]
*  They wanna make the defamation and libel laws so loose that you won't ever be able to criticize [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=625.62s)]
*  anyone who's powerful, they'll drive you to bankruptcy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=630.9399999999999s)]
*  So hell no to these nonsense intimidation lawsuits. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=634.3s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, be careful for all the content creators out there. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=639.02s)]
*  You can get sued real easily for making any tiny little mistake if proving actual malice [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=644.42s)]
*  is taken out of the standard or is no longer the standard in determining whether or not [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=649.38s)]
*  someone actually is guilty of defamation. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=655.6999999999999s)]
*  One more quick thing about that. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=658.26s)]
*  So for example, if you said Joe Biden was in mental decline, and you didn't have that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=659.78s)]
*  standard, Biden could have sued every right wing online host and could have sued Fox News. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=664.46s)]
*  Hey, you don't know, and us, you don't know, okay? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=669.54s)]
*  And so I don't care if you had malice or didn't have malice, you can't prove it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=675.2s)]
*  That's it, I own your company, okay? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=679.52s)]
*  I own your channel, I own your, and I know you think that Elon wouldn't do it to you [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=681.22s)]
*  if you're on the right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=685.98s)]
*  Sure, until you disagreed with him, right? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=687.86s)]
*  So that's why again, the Supreme Court holding here and doing the right thing was really [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=690.7s)]
*  important. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=696.34s)]
*  So we'll take this good news today. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euu-6T3T3q4&t=697.34s)]
