**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8)
*  from the meta policy is that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=0.0s)]
*  dehumanizing speech including [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=1.86s)]
*  calling people certain objects, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=4.14s)]
*  including women as a household [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=6.44s)]

*  been taken out of the policy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=16.96s)]
*  So that is now allowed I guess to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=18.94s)]

*  at times even contradictory. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=251.16s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg tried to clear it [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=253.4s)]

*  Take a look at this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=256.32s)]
*  Pete Hegseth is going to probably [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=258.04s)]

*  floor. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=264.6s)]
*  And I think one of the points that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  he's made is that he thinks that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=267.08s)]
*  women shouldn't be able to be in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=268.68s)]
*  certain combat roles. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=270.32s)]
*  And until we updated our policies, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=271.68s)]
*  that wouldn't have been a thing [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=273.52s)]
*  that you could have said on our [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=275.12s)]

*  for the exclusion of a protected [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  category of people. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=279.88s)]
*  And so it's like, okay, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=281.08s)]
*  like on its face, yeah, calling for [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=282.44s)]
*  the exclusion of a protected [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=284.40000000000003s)]

*  It's like okay to say on the floor [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=291.48s)]
*  of Congress, you should probably be [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=293.04s)]
*  able to debate it on social media. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=294.76s)]
*  Yeah, but yet again, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=296.36s)]
*  this point is being made very [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  generally and then a very specific [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  different thing is what's happening [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=301.84000000000003s)]

*  So that should have been allowed to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=305.6s)]
*  be discussed on social media. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=307.56s)]

*  bathrooms, for example, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=337.96s)]

*  And so that's just a bad [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=349.08s)]
*  implementation of their policy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=351.08s)]

*  things you can ban hate speech. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=539.12s)]
*  You can ban horribly disgusting [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=541.0s)]
*  statements without infringing on [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=542.92s)]
*  debate. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=545.12s)]
*  Those are very different things [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=546.04s)]
*  that comes down to where we draw [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=547.68s)]
*  the line between open dialogue and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=549.24s)]
*  hate speech. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=550.88s)]
*  What are your thoughts guys? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=551.68s)]
*  Let's go to Jordan first. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=552.52s)]
*  This is disgusting, obviously. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=554.12s)]
*  You're pointing out these [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=556.36s)]
*  statements that are permissible and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=557.32s)]
*  it would be offensive to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=559.24s)]
*  the rational person. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=560.6s)]
*  Any rational person would see these [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=561.8000000000001s)]
*  as morally objectionable, but [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=564.12s)]
*  why are they doing this? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=566.2s)]
*  There's a couple of reasons. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=567.6s)]
*  One, a years long game of whining [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=569.12s)]
*  to the refs by the right and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  making moderation online a partisan [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  issue. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=578.32s)]
*  And people of which political [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=578.96s)]
*  persuasion are more likely to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=581.2s)]
*  be on the receiving end of [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=584.48s)]
*  moderation for statements like [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=586.08s)]
*  Ben just listed. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=588.28s)]
*  I'm not saying there isn't racism [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=589.6s)]
*  on other parts of the political [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=591.4s)]
*  spectrum, but for comments like [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=593.12s)]
*  that, you typically see that in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=595.0400000000001s)]
*  larger numbers on the right. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=597.0s)]
*  And they have taken this up as [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=598.96s)]
*  a big partisan issue. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=601.28s)]
*  Additionally, you have to look at [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=603.84s)]
*  Facebook's actions here, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=605.96s)]
*  Metta's actions here through [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  the lens of their looming [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=609.44s)]
*  antitrust case. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=610.88s)]
*  They have a current pending [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=612.84s)]
*  antitrust case with the FTC over [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=615.0s)]
*  their acquisitions of Instagram and [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=617.6s)]
*  WhatsApp. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=620.6s)]
*  By catering to Trump, by currying [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  favor with the right as Trump comes [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=624.84s)]
*  in and is in a position to reshape [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=627.72s)]
*  or shift the priorities of those [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=630.5200000000001s)]
*  federal agencies, we might see that [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=633.32s)]
*  case dropped as a result. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=636.5200000000001s)]
*  So you have to look at it from [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  that lens. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=640.8s)]
*  I can't see any of what Zuckerberg [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=641.64s)]
*  is doing right now without [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=643.76s)]
*  acknowledging that antitrust case. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=647.68s)]
*  If Mark Zuckerberg, I'm just going [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=648.24s)]
*  to say if Mark Zuckerberg wasn't [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=650.92s)]
*  the dictator of Metta, then he [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=653.64s)]
*  would have been fired years ago. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=656.08s)]
*  There's been so many disasters [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=658.56s)]
*  surrounding his leadership over [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=660.68s)]
*  Facebook, particularly in elections [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=662.96s)]
*  worldwide. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=665.68s)]
*  At the end of the day, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=666.64s)]
*  he's just capitulating because he [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=668.0s)]
*  sees which way the political winds [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=670.92s)]
*  are blowing, but also he's trying [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=673.16s)]
*  to push the winds further in that [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=675.36s)]
*  direction. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=677.36s)]
*  Because people like him benefit [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=678.16s)]
*  the most by sucking up to people [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=680.04s)]
*  like Donald Trump who ultimately [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=681.84s)]
*  just want to be liked and who just [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=683.72s)]
*  want to have their boots licked. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=685.5600000000001s)]
*  You compliment Donald Trump, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=687.4s)]
*  he's likely to give you some type [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=688.84s)]
*  of pass. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=690.36s)]
*  Last time he was in office, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=690.88s)]
*  he gave corporate America the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=692.16s)]
*  largest tax cut they've ever seen. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=693.64s)]
*  And since he's been elected, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=695.44s)]
*  billionaires have gotten quite a [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=696.96s)]
*  lot of attention, including people [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=698.72s)]
*  like Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=700.6800000000001s)]
*  So this isn't him playing 40 [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=701.96s)]
*  chess, no, you're just sucking up [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=703.48s)]
*  to the right, as Jordan pointed [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=705.64s)]
*  out, all for the sake of people who [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=707.64s)]
*  are like, freedom of speech, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=709.64s)]
*  I've been so oppressed, my God, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=711.4s)]
*  I can't wait to get online and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=713.32s)]
*  call black people, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=714.96s)]
*  farm equipment, it's been so long, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=716.2s)]
*  I'm so hunkered in. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=718.4s)]
*  These people are losers. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=720.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, they cause a lot of [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=721.96s)]
*  issues in the country, but [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  it's like, boy, your life is [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=725.5600000000001s)]
*  back on track now because you can [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=727.0799999999999s)]
*  say things about black people and [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  trans people and gay people and [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=731.04s)]
*  not get it deleted, like, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=733.04s)]
*  congratulations. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=734.5999999999999s)]
*  So thus is corruption. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=735.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, both of you, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  I think, make the point perfectly. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=739.12s)]
*  This is not, it's so [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=741.24s)]
*  transparently done not to, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=743.1999999999999s)]
*  in any way, fine tune their [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=745.8s)]

*  better in this country, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=751.96s)]
*  to make it easier for [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=754.2800000000001s)]
*  people to have genuine debate. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=756.64s)]
*  It's just the most clear kiss ass [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=759.72s)]
*  move to appease an incoming [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=762.6s)]
*  authoritarian. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=765.0s)]
*  And it's just been so [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=766.52s)]
*  disheartening and sad to see all [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPy197oWi8&t=768.12s)]
