# Trump Launches Strikes on Houthis
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0)
*  Allegedly anti war president Donald Trump is escalating tensions in the Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=0.0s)]
*  by not only announcing that his administration has taken military action against the Houthis [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=5.66s)]
*  in Yemen, but also proclaiming that Iran will quote suffer the consequences of the Houthis [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=10.82s)]
*  actions. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=16.78s)]
*  On Saturday, Trump wrote on Truth Social, today I have ordered the United States military [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=17.78s)]
*  to launch decisive and powerful military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=23.3s)]
*  It has been over a year since a US flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=29.34s)]
*  Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=34.78s)]
*  The last American warship to go through the Red Sea four months ago was attacked by the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=39.06s)]
*  Houthis over a dozen times. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=43.64s)]
*  We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=46.66s)]
*  Our brave war fighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorist bases, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=52.1s)]
*  and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air and naval assets and to restore navigational [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=58.26s)]
*  freedom. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=66.38s)]
*  According to the Houthis, recent US strikes have killed around 50 people and injured around [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=68.14s)]
*  100. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=73.3s)]
*  But here's what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had to say about the attack. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=74.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=79.14s)]
*  The minute the Houthis say we'll stop shooting at your ships, we'll stop shooting at your [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=80.14s)]
*  drones. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=83.66s)]
*  This campaign will end, but until then, it will be unrelenting. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=84.98s)]
*  We got the reports last night, Maria. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=88.54s)]
*  The Houthi capital felt like an earthquake. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  Dozens and dozens of precision heavy munitions dropping precisely on the targets that we [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=95.54s)]
*  wanted to hit, sending a very clear message. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=100.44s)]
*  And the message is clear to Iran as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=103.22s)]
*  And the president said it in his truth. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=105.68s)]
*  Your support of the Houthis needs to end immediately. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=107.62s)]
*  We don't want a long, limited war in the Middle East. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=112.18s)]
*  We don't care what happens in the Yemeni civil war. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  But they do care and we'll get into that later. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=120.42s)]
*  The Houthis attempted to counter-strike with drones and a ballistic missile, but none came [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=123.14s)]
*  close to striking any US vessels. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=127.58s)]
*  The group maintains that it wants to support Palestinians and will stop its attacks once [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=130.74s)]
*  Israel ends its chokehold on Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump is also threatening Iran as well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=138.34s)]
*  Today, he wrote, Iran has played the innocent victim of rogue terrorists from which they've [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=140.9s)]
*  lost control, but they haven't lost control. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=147.18s)]
*  They're dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=150.66000000000003s)]
*  highly sophisticated military equipment, and even so-called intelligence. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon from this point forward as being shot [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  fired from the weapons and leadership of Iran. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=165.46s)]
*  And Iran will be held responsible and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=169.18s)]
*  be dire. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=174.82s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump's National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, did not rule out military force [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=176.1s)]
*  against Iran in an interview on ABC. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=181.86s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  Beware because America will hold you fully accountable. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  Does that mean direct military action on Iran is possible? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, all options are always on the table with the president, but Iran needs to hear [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=193.46s)]
*  him loud and clear. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=200.62s)]
*  It is completely unacceptable and it will be stopped. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=203.02s)]
*  The level of support that they've been providing the Houthis. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  Time will tell if these threats turn into military action, but what we do know is according [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=211.38s)]
*  to both the Biden and Trump administrations, Israel is hoping to strike Iran. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=216.46s)]
*  And apparently they want to do so this year. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=221.46s)]
*  US intelligence agencies had already concluded in the final days of the Biden administration [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=223.9s)]
*  that Israel was seriously considering carrying out the strikes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=228.9s)]
*  The intelligence analysis concluded Israel would push the Trump administration to back [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  the strikes, viewing him as more likely to join an attack than now former President Joe [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  Biden. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=243.38s)]
*  US intelligence produced a second report that they delivered to the Trump administration, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=244.38s)]
*  which reiterated that Israel is serious about carrying out the attacks. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=249.42s)]
*  US military support and munitions would likely be needed for an Israeli attack on Iran's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=253.94s)]
*  heavily fortified nuclear sites, given their complexity, US military officials say. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  During the presidential transition, some members of Trump's team considered the viability of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=265.58s)]
*  Israel launching preventative strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, including having US forces [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=270.7s)]
*  join Israeli aircraft in a bombing campaign. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=277.74s)]
*  Trump has stated that the reports of the US and Israel joining forces in a strike against [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=281.65999999999997s)]
*  Iran are, quote, greatly exaggerated. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=287.3s)]
*  Waz, there's a lot here, but what concerns you the most? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=290.42s)]
*  I think the Iran posture is the most concerning, because make no mistake, folks, when you hear [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=297.41999999999996s)]
*  Israel wants to carry out a strike, no, they want to drag us into a war with Iran. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=304.85999999999996s)]
*  They can't do anything out there on their own. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  They can't do anything unilaterally. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=314.02s)]
*  Everything they do has to be supported and paid for by the American government. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=316.5s)]
*  And so once you hear this, Israel wants to take an aggressive posture. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=322.4s)]
*  Don't fall for the joke and the tricks. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=326.7s)]
*  Israel wants to, they want to provoke actions against Iran, and so that the US can send [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=329.38s)]
*  its forces, its army, our people to go over there and die, our weapon support, our sort [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=337.22s)]
*  of aerial capabilities. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=345.78000000000003s)]
*  Israel can't do any of this stuff on its own. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=350.98s)]
*  So once you hear Israel talking about, rumors that they want to strike Iran, no, they want [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  to start something so that the US can actually get involved and finally take out a regime [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=358.78s)]
*  that Israel deems to be hostile to its plans to essentially take over what they call Greater [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=364.34s)]
*  Israel and finally finish off the ethnic cleansing that they started at the founding of the state [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=371.78s)]
*  of Israel, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  And so that's what worries me the most, because let's face it, guys, y'all need to understand [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=380.21999999999997s)]
*  this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=386.22s)]
*  The war in Afghanistan was a disaster. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=388.70000000000005s)]
*  We were there for 20 years. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=391.94000000000005s)]
*  We propped up our government, trillions of dollars spent, literally in the trillions [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=394.74s)]
*  spent on that war, forming a democracy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=399.14000000000004s)]
*  We were gone not even 48 hours. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=405.06s)]
*  And the thing we spent 20 years building was gone. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=407.82000000000005s)]
*  Taliban dudes came over and took over. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  We spent 20 years on that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=415.46s)]
*  Iraq, even everybody would say that Iraq is now in worse shape. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=417.62s)]
*  They've now drawn closer to the Iranians, horrible war, another decades plus over there, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=425.14s)]
*  disaster. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=432.14s)]
*  When I tell you that will look like major victory compared to a war with Iran, folks [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  do not understand this would be so disastrous. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=440.86s)]
*  And then I don't understand how these same people can come out and say, oh, China's the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=444.90000000000003s)]
*  big bad and the big threat. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=450.46000000000004s)]
*  We don't have unlimited military resources. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=452.26000000000005s)]
*  So if we divert all of our resources basically just to make Israel happy in a war in Iran, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=455.86s)]
*  Iran's not a threat to American interests. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=463.86s)]
*  Iran is not a threat to our existence. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=467.06s)]
*  Iran is just there. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=469.3s)]
*  We hate them because we don't have total hegemony in terms of influence in the Middle East. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=471.58s)]
*  But make no mistake about it, we'd be doing this on behalf of Israel. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=479.54s)]
*  And then again, just remember when these folks tell you how dangerous China is, how mighty [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=484.38s)]
*  the power is. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=488.38s)]
*  But yet we're gonna divert all of our resources to fighting a war with Iran for no strategic [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=489.38s)]
*  interests. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=496.38s)]
*  There's nothing there for us. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=498.42s)]
*  It's maddening, dude. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=500.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  And I want to point out a few things about Iran before I get into the Yemen component. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=503.90000000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=508.54s)]
*  So yes, like you're saying, it would be on behalf of Israel. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=509.54s)]
*  We have no reason to do it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  But the way that Trump would likely go about war with Iran would be one that is most destructive [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=513.78s)]
*  and has the least regard for human life. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=521.82s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=525.78s)]
*  The Trump administration also, at some points, had tense relationships with Iran. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=526.78s)]
*  And while they did sign the Iran deal, which I think is good, they also deployed Stuxnet, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=534.98s)]
*  which was a cyber attack that took out Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=542.98s)]
*  So there are ways of dismantling a nuclear facility that don't involve mass destruction [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=548.6999999999999s)]
*  and bombs. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=556.1800000000001s)]
*  Does Trump want to do that? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=558.5400000000001s)]
*  Does Trump want to go with the safest, cleanest option? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=559.98s)]
*  I'm not saying this is right. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=565.0200000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying these are some of the ways you can go about it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=566.3000000000001s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=569.5s)]
*  He wants the shock and awe. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=570.9000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't care about human life. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=572.82s)]
*  And also it further enriches the military industrial complex. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=575.7s)]
*  Because like they're saying, Israel would need munitions. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=580.5400000000001s)]
*  Who's going to manufacture those? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=584.1800000000001s)]
*  We would. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=586.7800000000001s)]
*  Who would benefit from those? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=587.7800000000001s)]
*  The military industrial complex, Trump's donors, his inner circle, those people are bound to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=589.86s)]
*  get even more wealthy if we inch toward or have a war with Iran. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=594.86s)]
*  So yet again, I am firmly opposed to any sort of military operation on behalf of Israel. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=602.86s)]
*  I certainly don't want to see one that wipes out what could be just an energy facility [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=612.26s)]
*  or energy facilities for a country. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=620.14s)]
*  Had he kept the Iran nuclear deal, you would have had a safeguard that would have prevented [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=622.98s)]
*  that uranium from being enriched to weapons grade. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=627.74s)]
*  He tore it up and now he expects them to just what? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=631.62s)]
*  Sit there and self-police? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=634.54s)]
*  In what world? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=638.46s)]
*  In what world would any country do that when you are facing a US backed threat in your [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=639.46s)]
*  region? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=644.98s)]
*  On the Yemen front, these airstrikes and these attacks on the Houthis in Yemen, you can think [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=647.06s)]
*  whatever you want about the Houthis themselves. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=656.38s)]
*  This is a furtherance of an illegal war that the US has been waging in that country for [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=658.86s)]
*  a decade now, over a decade. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=666.0600000000001s)]
*  Obama did it, Trump did it in his first term, Biden did it, now Trump's doing it again. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=669.38s)]
*  Just foreign policy and many other foreign policy organizations have been calling for [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=674.74s)]
*  a war powers resolution to stop this. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=677.98s)]
*  Nobody, barely anybody, let me be clear, barely anybody in either party in Congress is willing [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=680.9s)]
*  to do that. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=688.06s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=689.06s)]
*  So the president now has just unchecked authority to continue an illegal war in Yemen. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=690.1s)]
*  You all might remember, we collectively raised tens of thousands of dollars for relief aid [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=695.6999999999999s)]
*  in Yemen in 2022. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=701.34s)]
*  Unfortunately, we might need to do that again because of the US's role in that civil war. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=703.9s)]
*  Now, Pete Hegseth says, we don't care what happens in the Yemeni civil war. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=710.02s)]
*  And why was the US explicitly supporting the Saudi Air Force in that civil war? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=714.26s)]
*  Why? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=720.46s)]
*  If we don't care, why are we doing it? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=721.46s)]
*  Without the US's support of the Saudi military, that war would have been over immediately. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=723.78s)]
*  To say it was instrumental and consequential is an understatement. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=729.86s)]
*  Without the US's support, that would have been over. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=734.78s)]
*  But we did it and we helped enforce a blockade that prevented oil, that prevented food and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=738.28s)]
*  medical supplies from entering that country, that created a famine and starvation and hunger [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=743.72s)]
*  and suffering that until the war in Gaza was the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=749.24s)]
*  That's what your taxpayer dollars are doing. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=755.44s)]
*  And that's what our military is doing. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=757.5600000000001s)]
*  So when Pete Hegseth says, we don't care, it's either from a position of ignorance or [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=759.6s)]
*  an outright lie. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=764.1600000000001s)]
*  He might not care what happens to people in Yemen, but the US military and the national [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=765.48s)]
*  security state and the US government certainly does. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=770.44s)]
*  Was any final thoughts? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=774.0s)]
*  No, I think you basically covered it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=775.0s)]
*  We bombed the hell out of these folks on behalf of the Saudis, by the way. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=778.36s)]
*  And how did, like the Houthis are stronger than ever. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=782.1600000000001s)]
*  That's why it's laughable that these guys are gonna bomb their way into making the Houthis [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=784.32s)]
*  irrelevant. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=788.9200000000001s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  They're fine. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=790.9200000000001s)]
*  They're as strong and influential as they ever have been. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=791.96s)]
*  And this is after they bombed the hell out of the poorest country in the region, mind [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=794.84s)]
*  you, created an insane refugee crisis. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  It's just disturbing, honestly, our policy towards Yemen for over 10 years now. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=802.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=808.8s)]
*  They just don't care. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=809.8s)]
*  They don't care about people. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=811.48s)]
*  They don't care about human lives. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=812.48s)]
*  The party of pro-life loves death. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=813.48s)]
*  It is a blood cult. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=815.68s)]
*  And there's no other way to frame it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=817.0799999999999s)]
*  I just, it breaks my heart and nobody cares. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=819.3199999999999s)]
*  And Democrats aren't in a position, theme of this hour, Democrats aren't in a position [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=822.9599999999999s)]
*  to firmly stand up and oppose it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=827.52s)]
*  They aren't willing to introduce a war powers resolution because they don't want that limiting [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=829.6s)]
*  a future Democratic presidency. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=832.6s)]
*  They're becoming a party of war. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  And even though Trump to us is doing patently warmongering things, they just aren't in a [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  position to fight back. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=844.76s)]
*  They can't claim that ground. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=845.96s)]
*  They're ceding ground to the right on this issue and it's sad. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=848.04s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=850.76s)]
*  Totally not true. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=853.72s)]
*  But it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp07y6ZAyH0&t=854.88s)]
