TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Biden to Harris: DON'T YOU DARE Distance Yourself From Me!
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY)
*  Well, if anything, would you have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=0.0s)]
*  done something differently than [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=2.46s)]
*  President Biden during the past [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=4.8s)]
*  four years? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=7.12s)]
*  There is not a thing that comes to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=9.68s)]
*  mind in terms of and I've been a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=11.64s)]
*  part of most of the decisions that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=13.48s)]
*  have had impact. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=15.52s)]
*  That was one of the worst answers [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=16.68s)]
*  that at the time Democratic nominee [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=19.68s)]
*  for President Kamala Harris could [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=22.52s)]
*  have possibly given considering [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=25.28s)]
*  the fact that President Joe Biden [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=27.68s)]
*  was really, really low approval [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=30.12s)]
*  rating. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=32.24s)]
*  So the whole idea was in order to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  win, you need to differentiate [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=34.64s)]
*  yourself from the president. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=36.64s)]
*  But now we're learning that there [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  was a lot of pressure from Biden [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=40.84s)]
*  himself to ensure that Kamala Harris [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  did not in any way differentiate [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=45.84s)]
*  herself from Biden and his record. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  And I don't think that was the main [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=51.64s)]
*  reason why she lost. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=53.52s)]
*  I think it was one of the main [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=54.72s)]
*  reasons why she lost the election. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=56.36s)]
*  She was also not a great candidate. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=58.32s)]
*  But nonetheless, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=60.2s)]
*  these are revelations that have [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=61.4s)]
*  been detailed in a new book titled [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=63.36s)]
*  Fight Inside the Wildest Battle for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=65.44s)]
*  the White House. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=67.74s)]
*  It's written. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=68.84s)]
*  All right, let's go to Oz because. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=69.8s)]
*  No, just the way you sarcastically [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=73.28s)]
*  read that, you didn't have to do [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=75.84s)]
*  that, you didn't have to say [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=78.48s)]
*  the wildest. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=80.88s)]
*  Because when you think about Joe [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=82.4s)]
*  Biden and the devil, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=84.8s)]
*  Joe Biden and the Democrats, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  you just think wild ride, my goodness. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=89.36s)]
*  Well, it was wild, but [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=92.84s)]
*  not like in a good way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=94.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=96.04s)]
*  Just his total clown. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=96.72s)]
*  But anyway, it's written by [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=98.44s)]
*  Jonathan Allen and Amy Parnas. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=99.9s)]
*  Okay, now with that in mind, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=101.92s)]
*  they write that Biden made it clear [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=103.68s)]
*  to Harris prior to her debate with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=105.88s)]
*  Trump that she wasn't allowed to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  distance herself from his policies. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=110.12s)]
*  So here's what they write. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=113.2s)]
*  He would say publicly that Harris [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  should do what she must to win. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=116.84s)]
*  But privately, including in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=119.04s)]
*  conversations with her, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=120.9s)]
*  he repeated an admonition. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  Let there be no daylight between us. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=125.12s)]
*  Okay, so let me just pause real [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  quick and say, he's a piece of crap. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=129.28s)]
*  Okay, he absolutely is. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=132.84s)]
*  He's so concerned with his own [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=134.0s)]
*  legacy and his own record that he [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  doesn't want Kamala Harris to say, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=138.68s)]
*  look, this is how I differ from [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=141.4s)]
*  Biden and then win. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=143.8s)]
*  Because that's, I guess, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=146.24s)]
*  some way somehow like a poor [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=148.48s)]
*  judgment of how Biden led the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=150.88s)]
*  country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=153.4s)]
*  But Biden, he kind of screwed over [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=154.0s)]
*  the Democratic Party because he was [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=156.44s)]
*  so egotistical and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=159.08s)]
*  interested in his own power. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=160.4s)]
*  That was front and center in his [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=162.76s)]
*  mind, whatever was left of his mind. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=164.84s)]
*  And that's so [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=167.52s)]
*  incredibly frustrating. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=168.12s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=169.08s)]
*  But was, I'm sorry, you are running [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=170.12s)]
*  for President of the United States. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=172.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=175.52s)]
*  Okay, you're going to deal with [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  dictators, other world leaders who [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  are difficult to deal with. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  There are two major wars happening, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=182.4s)]
*  one between Israel and Hamas, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=184.96s)]
*  one between Putin and Zelensky. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=187.12s)]
*  You're really going to cower to Joe [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  Biden, who is barely even [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=191.88000000000002s)]
*  functioning. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  So I think both parties are guilty [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=195.44s)]
*  here, in my opinion. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I believe Biden said all of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=199.68s)]
*  this crap, but I don't see why [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=201.8s)]
*  Kamala had to abide by this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=203.84s)]
*  This guy was a lame duck, cooked, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=205.68s)]
*  one of the most unpopular [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=207.96s)]
*  presidents of our lifetime. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=209.56s)]
*  Why am I taking political advice [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=211.24s)]
*  from a guy who's a duck? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=216.24s)]
*  And I think there's a certain [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=219.52s)]
*  point where Kamala, because she did [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=221.08s)]
*  take on his entire campaign staff, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  where it's like, do I go out and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=225.08s)]
*  become somebody that's throwing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=226.8s)]
*  Biden, quote unquote, under the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=228.72000000000003s)]
*  bus in order to advance my career? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=230.52s)]
*  My answer is, again, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=232.84s)]
*  as I mentioned before, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=234.28s)]
*  y'all telling me fascism is on the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=235.88000000000002s)]
*  line, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=238.12s)]
*  But yet Joe Biden's sensitive [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=239.24s)]
*  fee fee can't possibly be a bridge. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  To me, that's insanity. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=246.84s)]
*  And I think this is just cap, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  honestly, this is just Kamala and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=251.64000000000001s)]

*  The truth of the matter is the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=257.68s)]
*  people that were around her were [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=259.12s)]
*  completely fine with being like, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=260.76s)]
*  it's a continuity thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=262.56s)]
*  You're just a newer, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=264.04s)]
*  fresher version of Joe. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=264.84s)]
*  They just didn't like Joe because [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=265.92s)]
*  he was old, not because they [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=267.6s)]
*  didn't agree with the job that he [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=269.0s)]
*  did. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=270.6s)]
*  And obviously that was just [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=271.2s)]
*  a huge mistake. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=272.88s)]
*  Just the idea that a president [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=273.76s)]
*  who's approval rating, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=275.72s)]
*  you could see right there that you [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=277.36s)]

*  you know what? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=283.52s)]
*  I'd be out there every single day [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=284.2s)]

*  I'm fighting for them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=287.52s)]
*  I think the reason why Trump even [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=288.56s)]
*  has a chance right now is that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=290.48s)]
*  we didn't do a good enough job [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=292.16s)]
*  reminding these folks how much [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=293.92s)]

*  The idea that like, no, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=298.6s)]
*  I wouldn't do anything. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=299.8s)]
*  That's idiocy, I'm sorry. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=301.04s)]
*  It is, yep, it is. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=302.96s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=305.16s)]
*  think about this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=306.56s)]
*  She's about to have a debate with [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=308.4s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=310.52s)]
*  Regardless of how confident you [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=312.52s)]
*  are as a person, and I don't think [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=314.08s)]
*  Kamala Harris is confident, but [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=315.6s)]
*  let's just say she's a confident [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=317.04s)]
*  person. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=318.44s)]
*  Even in that scenario, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=318.96s)]
*  you're still nervous before a [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=319.92s)]
*  debate. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=321.2s)]
*  A human reaction. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=321.88000000000005s)]
*  He hits her up right before [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=325.32000000000005s)]
*  the debate to give her a pep talk. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=326.76000000000005s)]
*  But get a load of this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=328.56s)]
*  The day of the debate, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  Biden called to give Harris [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=331.24s)]
*  an unusual kind of pep talk. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  And another reminder about [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=335.04s)]
*  the loyalty he demanded. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=336.76000000000005s)]
*  No longer able to defend his own [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=338.92s)]
*  record, he expected Harris to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=340.92s)]
*  protect his legacy. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  So you know, as a candidate, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  Harris probably knew, it's likely [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to get asked a question [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=350.24s)]
*  about how I differ from Joe Biden. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  She gets this call right before [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=355.08s)]
*  the debate, you're going to be [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=356.4s)]
*  even more nervous because you're [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  anticipating that question. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=359.2s)]
*  You have Joe Biden's words in your [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=360.64s)]
*  head. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=362.96s)]
*  And I just would have been like, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=364.36s)]
*  shut up and sit down old man. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to do my thing, okay? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm hanging up the phone. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=368.59999999999997s)]

*  debate. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=371.64s)]
*  And it's just leaders lead, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  period, leaders lead. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=374.59999999999997s)]
*  Leaders are not led, they lead. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=377.24s)]
*  And that's not what Kamala Harris [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=379.76s)]
*  did in this situation and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=381.52s)]
*  Biden's just really a gross guy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=382.96s)]
*  Whether she won or [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=384.92s)]
*  lost the election, he thought. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=386.08s)]
*  She would only harm him by publicly [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=388.08s)]
*  distancing herself from him, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=390.28s)]
*  especially during a debate that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=392.2s)]
*  would be watched by millions [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  of Americans. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=395.96s)]
*  To the extent that she wanted to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=396.8s)]
*  forge her own path, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=398.68s)]
*  Biden had no interest in giving [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=399.8s)]
*  her room to do so. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  He needed just three words to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=403.68s)]
*  convey how much all of that mattered [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=405.84s)]
*  to him. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=408.56s)]
*  No daylight kid. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=409.92s)]

*  the Democratic Party used to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=705.28s)]

*  should go. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZVtN_1_TdY&t=729.0s)]
