# Trump's Pentagon Just Ordered Military To Purge Transgender Service Members
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w)
*  The White House is now seeking to actively remove active trans service members, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=0.0s)]
*  with a few exceptions from the military. Now the Trump administration in his first term had banned [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  transgender Americans from being able to join the military. The latest executive order takes it a step [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  further and it's all announced in a Pentagon memo. So the Pentagon memo communicated, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=20.32s)]
*  well, basically that, yeah, we're going to now remove anyone who is openly transgender within the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=26.16s)]
*  military. This was revealed as part of a lawsuit that was filed by an activist group, an LGBTQ plus [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  group that sued the White House over their effort in removing transgender people from the military. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  An earlier memo from the Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, had said that people with a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=50.8s)]
*  history of gender dysphoria would no longer be able to join the military, but that they would be [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=55.92s)]
*  treated with dignity and respect. The new memo goes a step further in stating that current [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=60.88s)]
*  service members will be removed if they have gender dysphoria or a history of it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=67.12s)]
*  Now service members have also been treated for gender dysphoria with hormones or surgery. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=73.44s)]
*  Those individuals will also be banned from the military and the memo also directs the secretaries [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=81.91999999999999s)]
*  of each branch to identify service members with gender dysphoria within the next 30 days and to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=87.36s)]
*  begin separation actions within 30 days after that. So I'm going to give you more details on the suit, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  but Cenk, I'm curious what you think. Yeah, I hate this. And so this is dividing Americans. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  These folks signed up willing to die for this country. Now what you're going to drag them [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=106.24s)]
*  out of the military and say we don't want you because we don't like the kind of person you are? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=110.88s)]
*  It's disgusting. So- We haven't seen a single issue arise within the military in regard to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=118.72s)]
*  transgender service members serving in the military, right? There's nothing so far that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  I've seen the Trump administration point to as the rationale, the good reason for why they would do [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=134.0s)]
*  something like this. Because honestly, I suspect there isn't a good reason. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=139.6s)]
*  Of course not. Hold on, you want to talk about virtue signaling? This is the right wing version [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  of virtue signaling, right? Needlessly being cruel to a group of people who haven't caused [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=149.12s)]
*  any problems whatsoever in order to virtue signal to your right wing base. I'm doing what you want [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=155.28s)]
*  me to do and being needlessly cruel to transgender people. Okay, I mean, these are people again [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=163.2s)]
*  who are willing to serve in a military that right now is having an incredibly difficult time [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=168.32s)]
*  recruiting Americans to serve in. Yeah, so look, the responsibility and the fault of this lies [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=173.04s)]
*  completely on the Trump administration that's taking these actions. But whenever something [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=178.64s)]
*  goes wrong, you have to be honest about analyzing how do we get there, okay? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=183.12s)]
*  And when a pendulum swings too far, it always swings back. And when it swings back, it also [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=187.84s)]
*  swings back too far. So that's why we didn't want that pendulum swinging, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=194.0s)]
*  because we had it at a pretty good place. Which was in the Trump administration, the first time [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=198.4s)]
*  around, they tried, they did the ban on people in the military, and it was not very popular. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=203.44s)]
*  And they did not try to root out the transgender folks who were already in the military, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=210.64s)]
*  up to potentially 15,000 service members, okay? So and they tried bathrooms for a little bit, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=214.8s)]
*  and it didn't work. And we fought them back on that effectively, because we were reasonable [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=222.48s)]
*  and the American people were on our side, and the polling indicated that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  And then in the meanwhile, since the first Trump administration, what happened? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=230.48s)]
*  Some folks on our side decided, no, we want that pendulum to swing as far as humanly possible. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  Saying absurd things like Floyd Mayweather can declare himself a woman, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=241.04s)]
*  and next day go into a boxing ring with biological women. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=245.2s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=248.88s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're swinging it like, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=252.0s)]
*  things always happen as reactions to extreme things like that. I'm not blaming folks [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=256.88s)]
*  for taking this action, because they didn't take this action. Trump did and his administration did. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=263.92s)]
*  But I'm telling you, just like when we talk about the Middle East, why was there terrorism? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=268.4s)]
*  We could just be do the Joe Scarborough thing, they hate us because they hate us, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=273.6s)]
*  right? But that's not smart. You have to see and analyze, how did we get there, right? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=277.04s)]
*  So I mean, some folks, not a lot, but some defend gender reassignment surgeries for minors. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=282.48s)]
*  You go tell an average American that we're gonna do gender reassignment surgery for 12 year olds. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=289.6s)]
*  That pendulum's all the way up there, and it's gonna swing all the way back, right? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  And now I've been on shows with transgender hosts, they're like, stop the pendulum. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=300.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ, man, they're kicking us out of bathrooms. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=306.24s)]
*  We were, God damn, we're going backwards, we're going backwards, stop, stop. And by the way, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  another giant responsibility here is in right-wing media. Man, they drove that hatred, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=317.84s)]
*  cuz they didn't stop at, hey, that's unreasonable, or most Americans don't agree with that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=323.52s)]
*  They started talking about dysphoria and how it's a mental illness and these people are all mental, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  etc. Now this is one of the issues, you just can't talk to them at gun. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=333.44s)]
*  The minute you say transgender, they get triggered to no end, right? They're all mentally ill. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=336.8s)]
*  I'm like, is it them? I mean, look at how you're reacting. So there are folks who are, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=342.24s)]
*  the great majority of the country doesn't wanna be cruel, right? They don't wanna be extreme, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=346.88s)]
*  and they don't wanna be cruel. This is cruel. So we've gotta, I don't know how in the world [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=352.64s)]
*  we're gonna reverse this. I don't think we can under Trump. But if and when a Democrat wins, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=358.8s)]
*  this would be one of the first things to reverse, and it's not just about transgender folks. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=363.76s)]
*  It's about who are we as a country? Do we believe in equal rights? Do we all believe in each other? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=368.88s)]
*  Do we love each other? Or are we gonna create these wedge issues that split us to no end [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=374.64s)]
*  and get us to fight each other and hate each other? This is hateful and it's wrong. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=379.68s)]
*  So I thought it was kind of interesting how the Pentagon kind of puts out this very [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=384.4s)]
*  vague statement to justify what they're doing. So they say that medical, surgical, and mental [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=390.96s)]
*  health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria are inconsistent with the high standards [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=397.68s)]
*  expected of US troops. But then they also specifically note that there are exceptions, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  okay? The memo states that exceptions could be made for transgender service members who directly [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=410.4s)]
*  support war fighting capabilities if the government feels it has a compelling reason to retain them. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=415.52s)]
*  Which one is it? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=421.12s)]
*  So wait, are they mentally ill and should be kicked out of the army right away? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=421.84s)]
*  Or are they some of our best warriors? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=425.76s)]
*  Okay, so- And by the way, Anna, sorry, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  one more thing that's a total inconsistency is they say the current right-wing thinking is [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=429.84s)]
*  there's only two genders, there's only men and women. And these transgender women are not women, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  they're men, they're biological men, that's why they should not be in women's sports, okay? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=440.72s)]
*  Now wait, you say men are better at combat than women are, and you say that they are men, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=447.44s)]
*  so why shouldn't they be in the military? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=454.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's why this is to me, look, it's gonna do damage, right? Because I do think that there [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=456.56s)]
*  are transgender service members who are now going to be purged from the military [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=461.76s)]
*  over this discriminatory policy. But this is just virtue signaling, that's honestly what this is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  for the Trump administration. And look, we don't even know how many transgender service members [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=472.56s)]
*  there are in the military because they don't keep tabs on that. So there are high estimates of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=477.28s)]
*  15,000 total, like around 15,000. The lower end of the estimates put it at a little over 4,000 [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=482.4s)]
*  service members. But it's just cruelty for cruelty sake, there's no real evidence provided [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=489.36s)]
*  showing that transgender service members have caused any kind of problem with the military. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=496.72s)]
*  By the way, the military has had some long standing issues that continue to go unaddressed, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=500.88s)]
*  including rape, sexual abuse, not just to female service members, but in some cases, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  male service members as well. Yeah, that's such a great point. Look, guys, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=510.8s)]
*  generals have literally testified in Congress saying there's not been a single case of a [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=515.04s)]
*  transgender person lowering morale or creating an issue, creating a conflict that we had to resolve. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=519.68s)]
*  In the NCAAs, as I keep saying, 500,000 athletes, only ten or trans, or the whole [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=526.88s)]
*  country's obsessed with it for no reason, right? In this case, there's zero problems, literally [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  zero, I couldn't even find one, right? But yet here we are. And meanwhile, sexual assault in [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=537.12s)]
*  the military is a significant problem. But we're not, no, don't look at that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZPAchcs_w&t=544.4s)]
