# Pam Bondi DEMANDS Jasmine Crockett Apologize To Tesla Shareholders
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o)
*  She must apologize immediately, not only to all Texans, but to our country, to the American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=0.0s)]
*  shareholders of Tesla. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=6.76s)]
*  Yeah, Jasmine Crockett, when are you gonna apologize to the shareholders of Tesla? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=8.52s)]
*  That's what Attorney General Pam Bondi is demanding from the Congresswoman from Texas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  She wants the apology following a statement that Congresswoman Crockett had made in a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=20.36s)]
*  live stream in order to retaliate against Elon Musk for what he and Doge are doing in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=26.42s)]
*  regard to gutting government institutions. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=33.1s)]
*  Let's actually hear what she had to say in that live stream that got all this negative [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=36.660000000000004s)]
*  attention from Republicans and Bondi. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=40.42s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=42.88s)]
*  On March 29th, it's my birthday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=43.88s)]
*  And all I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon to be taken down, yes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=46.34s)]
*  Listen, I have learned as I serve on the Doge Oversight Committee that there is only [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=52.62s)]
*  one language that the people that are in charge understand right now, and that language is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=59.62s)]
*  money. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=65.46s)]
*  So obviously she's referring to the protests, not the violent ones, not the firebombing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  She didn't advocate for any of that, but she's talking about the money, meaning if the value [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=73.02s)]
*  of the shares for Tesla goes down, well, that's the movement being effective in fighting back [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  against Elon Musk. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=84.9s)]
*  She did not advocate for violence. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=86.14s)]
*  I want to be clear about that, although some on the right are trying to make it seem as [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  though she was advocating for violence. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=91.02s)]
*  That is not the case at all. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  She's talking about hitting the company where it hurts, and that means the value of its [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  shares. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we have a different theory, which we'll get to in a second. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  But later on in that same exact statement, she said, obviously we don't mean violence, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=103.26s)]
*  we mean what Ana just explained. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=108.94s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=110.7s)]
*  So it wasn't like she clarified later, and it wasn't just that it was obvious. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=111.7s)]
*  She literally said, do not do violence. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=115.54s)]
*  In the same live stream, yes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  And so just about 20 seconds after what we just showed you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=119.62s)]
*  Okay, so then Pam Bondi originally came out and said, yeah, she better watch herself and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=123.66000000000001s)]
*  threatening her as like they might arrest her. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=130.34s)]
*  Remember, Pam Bondi, believe it or not, is the Attorney General of the United States. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=133.14s)]
*  And so now that she has to acknowledge it, she was asked about it, and she's like, okay, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=137.42s)]
*  fine, she didn't ask for violence, okay? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  But she's hurting the Tesla shareholders, and that's violence towards corporate profits, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=144.42s)]
*  the most precious thing in the world. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=150.5s)]
*  This from an administration that claimed to be populist. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  So look. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=157.38s)]
*  Hilarious. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=158.38s)]
*  There are all sorts of arguments made in order to provide cover for Tesla. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=159.74s)]
*  But what about all of the pension funds and retirement accounts that are invested in Tesla? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=163.62s)]
*  Those are the little guys. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=168.46s)]
*  Okay, let's stop pretending like Elon Musk defenders are worried about the little guys [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=169.98s)]
*  as Elon Musk and Doge literally fire Social Security Administration workers, close Social [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  Security Administration field offices, and dismantle Social Security without even having [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=180.82s)]
*  to pass any legislation in Congress to do it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=185.26s)]
*  They don't care about the little guy at all. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=188.58s)]
*  But the thing that I will say here is, if you're worried about the shareholders, don't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=190.58s)]
*  you think Elon Musk should maybe apologize to them? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  Because a lot has been made about how these protests have been the causal link to the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=199.38000000000002s)]
*  share prices going down. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  But apparently, and based on some of the research I've been doing into Tesla even prior to Doge, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=208.38000000000002s)]
*  a lot of these big name investors had been pulling out of Tesla to the tune of tens of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=215.06s)]
*  millions of dollars. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  And more and more of those huge Tesla fans, big name investors, I'm talking about corporate [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=222.5s)]
*  CEOs are now going on national television. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=228.18s)]
*  And they're admitting that there's a real problem with the lack of leadership in that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=231.02s)]
*  company. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=234.98000000000002s)]
*  Okay, the bad decisions that are being made, the products that are being rolled out that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  aren't even completely finished yet. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=240.22s)]
*  So I'm gonna give you that evidence in just a moment, but Cenk, go ahead. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=242.88s)]
*  Yeah, but I mentioned that we have a different theory. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=245.56s)]
*  We could make Pam Bondi very happy by making sure the Tesla profits go up as long as we [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  get our cut. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=256.92s)]
*  Because the United States government subsidized Tesla. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=258.48s)]
*  And so normally when you put money into something, you get a return, you get shares back, okay? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=262.46s)]
*  So we've launched this site, wherezarkut.com. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=268.8s)]
*  And we'd like to ask Elon, where's our cut? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=273.08s)]
*  So Elon Musk's business have taken over $38 billion in government subsidies, contracts, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  loans and tax credits from the American people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=280.8s)]
*  So where's our return on investment instead of pretending to save us money by gutting [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=284.32s)]
*  the federal government and slashing safety net programs that help those in need? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=287.64s)]
*  Let's tell Musk and Congress to pay us to return on our investment. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  Elon, where's our cut? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=294.32s)]
*  And by the way, then we'd be rooting for Tesla, because we'd be getting some of the money [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=295.36s)]
*  that we deserve as shareholders in Tesla for subsidizing Tesla all this time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=298.96s)]
*  Go to wherezarkut.com, we'll have the link in the description box below. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=304.26s)]
*  And you can sign a petition on it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=309.08s)]
*  You could actually, we have Elon's email. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  You could email Elon, you could email Doge, you could email all those folks and ask, where's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  our cut? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=318.8s)]
*  We're just trying to help. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=319.8s)]
*  That way, the beloved Tesla shareholders would be the American people to some degree. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=321.0s)]
*  I wonder if he'll agree to that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=326.24s)]
*  That'll bring more back into the American treasury. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=327.72s)]
*  That's what Doge was supposed to do, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=330.24s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=332.2s)]
*  But it turns out, he's having a little bit of trouble at Tesla, as Ana's about to tell [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=333.2s)]
*  you. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=337.16s)]
*  And I started seeing the trouble when guys like Dave Portnoy, who are more on the right [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=338.16s)]
*  and support Trump, were like, what the hell's going on here? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=342.84s)]
*  Who's running Tesla at this point? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=345.52s)]
*  It sounds like no one, because there are some serious issues over at Tesla. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=347.4s)]
*  And again, that's not just based on what I'm saying. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=351.08s)]
*  I'm gonna show you the receipts, starting with the smaller issues, and then we're gonna [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=353.56s)]
*  work our way up to the bigger issues. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  So first off, Financial Times, which is one of my favorite publications. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=358.96s)]
*  I think they do a real good job with straight news reporting and also reporting on stories [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=362.56s)]
*  that no one else is reporting on. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=366.82s)]
*  Well, they had written about how Tesla spent $6.3 billion in capital expenditures. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  And that was in the last half of last year. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  So the last six months of 2024, they spent $6.3 billion in capital expenditures. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  But the gross value of the company's assets increased by only $4.9 billion. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=385.4s)]
*  And so what explains the $1.4 billion discrepancy? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=392.28s)]
*  And more importantly, why did they take out debt to engage in these capital expenditures [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=396.08s)]
*  when they're sitting on a ton of money? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=400.36s)]
*  A closer look at Tesla's cash flow statement may also prompt investors to ask other questions [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=401.96s)]
*  such as why a business with a $37 billion cash pile raised $6 billion of new debt last [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=407.96s)]
*  year? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=415.4s)]
*  A combination of excess cash flow and ongoing capital raising is another red flag that can [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=416.4s)]
*  signal accounting misstatements. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  So that obviously needs to be investigated further. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=426.09999999999997s)]
*  And as of March 19th, Tesla's stock market valuation crashed from 1.7 trillion to below [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=429.08000000000004s)]
*  800 billion. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=438.6s)]
*  Now some of Musk's own friends and family members have actually been dumping Tesla stock. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=440.16s)]
*  Should they apologize to the remaining shareholders? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=446.20000000000005s)]
*  The Tesla shareholders have been agreed. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=449.36s)]
*  We need to- This is the most important thing for our [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=451.24s)]
*  government. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=453.08000000000004s)]
*  Forget the American people, who cares? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  Tesla shareholders. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=456.08000000000004s)]
*  This is what populism has been all about, shareholders, corporations, stock market. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  Let me give you specific examples, starting with James Murdoch, who is a strange son of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  media mogul Rupert Murdoch. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=468.03999999999996s)]
*  So James Murdoch, a Tesla board member and friend of Elon Musk, sold $13.3 million worth [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=470.02s)]
*  of Tesla shares, which drove the company to its worst single day decline since September [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=477.18s)]
*  of 2020. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=482.24s)]
*  This happened in early March, okay? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=483.32s)]
*  13.2, yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=485.2s)]
*  So, and by the way, his sale comes after another non-executive director made similar moves, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=486.2s)]
*  including Tesla chair Robin Denholm, who sold $75 million worth of Tesla stock, as reported [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=494.28s)]
*  by ABC News on March 18th. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=501.8s)]
*  Then you have Elon Musk's own brother, Kimball, who sold $27 million worth of shares. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=504.08s)]
*  I mean, if the fundamentals are there, if Tesla's such a great company, if you believe [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=510.76s)]
*  in the future of Tesla, which isn't just a car company, it's also a robotics company, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  an AR company, that's what we're all being told, right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=519.3199999999999s)]
*  If you believe in the future, why would you sell tens of millions of dollars worth of [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=521.68s)]
*  Tesla stock? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=526.0s)]
*  I'm sure it has nothing to do with protests at Tesla dealerships. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=527.0s)]
*  Or by the way, I mean, we don't know, and I don't know where that 1.4 billion is, and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=530.48s)]
*  it might be a normal irregularity. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=534.76s)]
*  They're gonna have to figure that out. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=536.72s)]
*  It's a public company, etc. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  But why are all these insiders selling their stock? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=540.28s)]
*  A lot of it too, yeah. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=544.64s)]
*  Do they know something we don't know? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=545.64s)]
*  I mean, look, I don't know. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  It might be that they're just looking at it going, Elon hasn't showed up to work in a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=549.76s)]
*  long, long time. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=553.9599999999999s)]
*  And so maybe they're worried about that, maybe they're worried about other things. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=556.1199999999999s)]
*  But they're definitely worried, because they're dumping the stock like nobody's business. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  And that takes us to Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber, who desperately wants Tesla to find [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=563.4s)]
*  another CEO. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  He believes in the product. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  He obviously owns shares of Tesla stock. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=573.36s)]
*  But he's worried about the leadership vacuum right now and the poor decisions, and he said [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=576.52s)]
*  so on national television. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=581.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=582.92s)]
*  It's five years ago to the day that the great Tesla run began, which lasted about 18 months [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=583.92s)]
*  and peaked in November 01 when he started selling Tesla stock to buy Twitter. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=589.24s)]
*  So it started with the purchase of Twitter, and it's just gone worse and worse and worse [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=593.88s)]
*  And now, literally, working at the government, working with Donald Trump and having Trump [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=599.08s)]
*  and Ludnick pitching Tesla stock and cars. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=603.84s)]
*  I mean, that's how bad it is. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  How about just running traditional ads and separating yourself from the brand? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=608.6s)]
*  He has CEOs who run his other companies. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=613.86s)]
*  I don't understand why he won't let Tesla have a dedicated CEO. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=615.88s)]
*  For me, it's not about politics. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  It's about selling EVs. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=622.2s)]
*  We are selling less EVs. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=624.1s)]
*  We have the best products on the market, and we're selling less of them while the market's [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=626.0s)]
*  growing fast. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=630.26s)]
*  Why is everybody still in denial on why this is happening and what the solutions are to [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=632.14s)]
*  solving it? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=636.9200000000001s)]
*  So there you have it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=638.7s)]
*  He's talking about how even before these protests, already the stock value was going down. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=640.08s)]
*  There was a bump after Trump got elected because obviously, Elon Musk is gonna have some sway [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=645.74s)]
*  over the Trump administration that could potentially help his business. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=650.08s)]
*  But that hasn't actually come to fruition. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=653.44s)]
*  I'm gonna go to one more video, Cenk, because this is the most interesting part of that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=655.1s)]
*  interview where Gerber talks about owning a cyber truck and being a little bit concerned [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=659.18s)]
*  with the quality of the product. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=665.1s)]
*  Now he just said, we have the best products. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=666.9s)]
*  But then in that same interview, he also said this. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=670.14s)]
*  We have to sell cars, ultimately, to make money. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=672.42s)]
*  I know the AI story is wonderful, and robotics is a hope for them. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=674.78s)]
*  But I live in LA, and yesterday in horrible traffic, waymos were working fine. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=679.32s)]
*  And I had to disengage my full self driving over and over and over again. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=685.48s)]
*  So this fantasy that their software actually works to the level of its competitors is also [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=688.4000000000001s)]
*  an issue. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=695.5200000000001s)]
*  I drive a cyber truck, now I gotta take it in for another recall. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=696.5200000000001s)]
*  This is an incomplete product. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=699.1600000000001s)]
*  And I actually love my cyber truck, and I could sell cyber trucks left and right if [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=701.0600000000001s)]
*  They actually had ads and fixed a few of the flaws. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  But this was an incomplete product, and there's problem after problem with it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=709.48s)]
*  And I think it's emblematic of the problems of having a distracted CEO on top of the marketing [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=712.76s)]
*  issues he's created. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=719.72s)]
*  I think Gerber makes a compelling point, and I'm hoping that Attorney General Pam Bondi [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  has a talk with Elon Musk, so he apologized to his shareholders. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=725.76s)]
*  My God, he's so right. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=729.52s)]
*  You better watch himself, because if you cost a dime to Tesla shareholders, the Attorney [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=730.88s)]
*  General might arrest you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=735.96s)]
*  I mean, Jasmine Crockett's been warned, so maybe Elon Musk should be warned. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=736.96s)]
*  Look, last two things you hadn't heard, the cyber trucks got recalled. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=740.2800000000001s)]
*  They're a disaster. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=743.84s)]
*  And it goes to the point that I've been making about Elon Musk and why he's gonna screw up [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=744.84s)]
*  Doge Royally. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=749.08s)]
*  And the answer is you can't just go in and just cut, cut, cut blindly. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=751.0s)]
*  Cut every corner there is, not actually do a real analysis, and then hope to get the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=756.0s)]
*  right results. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=760.12s)]
*  And when you're making cars and you cut corners, you're gonna have to recall all the cars. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=761.32s)]
*  And so that's what happened with the cyber trucks. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=767.6s)]
*  And so look, like I said, we're rooting for them, because I'm sure that Elon is going [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=771.0s)]
*  to agree when he goes to where's our cut.com or when you guys email him through that, that [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=776.54s)]
*  hey, since the American People subsidize your company, we should own a piece of it, then [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=780.84s)]
*  we'll root for you, right? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=784.8s)]
*  Right, Elon? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=786.48s)]
*  I mean, because you don't want waste fraud and abuse, and wouldn't it make sense for [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=787.64s)]
*  all the companies that we give money to? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=791.64s)]
*  Oil companies get $30 billion in subsidies. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=793.44s)]
*  Your company's got all these subsidies that we should get a percentage of the cut, and [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=795.72s)]
*  then we'll all be rooting for you. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=799.8000000000001s)]
*  But look, guys, Tesla's got a world of problems, and Elon's got a world of problems in the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=801.24s)]
*  real world. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=806.24s)]
*  And so I'm curious to see how this movie's gonna end. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=807.64s)]
*  But from day one, there's always been something off with Elon Musk. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=812.32s)]
*  So I can't see it, I don't know what it is in terms of what he's doing and how he's worth [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  this much when there's just something off entirely about it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=825.4s)]
*  But to be fair, I don't know what it is specifically. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=830.6800000000001s)]
*  But as you see things unraveling, there is no secret genius where like, yeah, my stock [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=834.48s)]
*  price will plummet to half of what it was, but that's part of my secret genius. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=841.04s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=845.3199999999999s)]
*  It's just that you didn't show up to work, your products aren't working, you're in a [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=846.3199999999999s)]
*  world of trouble, and that's why your stock price went down. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=851.16s)]
*  He's not a genius, and the cuts at Doge will turn in, are already a disaster and will be [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=854.04s)]
*  a much larger one, cuz he's not putting any thought into it. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=859.12s)]
*  Yeah, and look, my whole point is, as much as protesters and activists wanna believe [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=862.68s)]
*  that they alone have impacted the stock value for Tesla, at the end of the day, his poor [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=869.42s)]
*  leadership, even before Doge became this big controversial thing, was harming Tesla. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=875.66s)]
*  Remember, Tesla's valuation, guys, the value of the shares is based on these lofty promises [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=881.9s)]
*  that Elon Musk has made about the future of the company that he hasn't carried out yet. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=889.14s)]
*  This has nothing to do with AI, promises having to do with the robotics arm of Tesla. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=893.74s)]
*  And really, there hasn't been much movement in those areas to show that he's gonna be [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=899.9s)]
*  able to fulfill those lofty promises, and clearly, those internal to Tesla. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=904.82s)]
*  I'm talking about the big shareholders who dumped tens of millions of dollars worth of [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=910.42s)]
*  stock know that, otherwise they wouldn't have dumped that stock. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=913.66s)]
*  Yeah, last couple things here. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=918.02s)]
*  He's got Shane Smith energy written all over him. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=919.74s)]
*  That's the guy who used to run Vice, and he would always talk about, we're gonna be [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=922.06s)]
*  large in the CNN and MTV and ESPN and everything combined. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=925.14s)]
*  And a bunch of suckers put in billions of dollars in the Vice, and then it went bankrupt [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=930.02s)]
*  because he was full of crap. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  And one of the things that Musk has done right throughout his career is marketing, but apparently [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=937.42s)]
*  he's lost that touch too. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=941.3s)]
*  Because if you think about it for a second, you go and do all this stuff, and by the way, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=942.3s)]
*  not only do you piss off half the country, the Democrats and independents that voted [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=946.38s)]
*  against Trump. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=949.66s)]
*  But then on top of that, you go and you start chopping away, you start firing a whole bunch [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=950.9s)]
*  of people, chopping away at social security, etc. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=954.6999999999999s)]
*  You think that's good marketing for your company that sells to the public? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=957.3399999999999s)]
*  No, that's disastrous marketing. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=962.42s)]
*  You're cutting off half the country, and it's not like you're subtle. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=965.5s)]
*  It's not like, well, I mean, he's a Trump voter, what are you gonna do? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=970.42s)]
*  He's a Trump supporter, that's okay, right? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=972.5799999999999s)]
*  No, he's actively doing the cutting himself. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=974.66s)]
*  He's actively attacking half the country himself. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=977.56s)]
*  And the people who buy electric vehicles are more on the left. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=981.76s)]
*  It's the worst marketing in the world. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=985.4s)]
*  What happened to genius? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=987.56s)]
*  What happened to genius? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=988.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if we're gonna get enough for our shares in Tesla after he agrees that we [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=989.88s)]
*  should get some. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME9UFbO849o&t=993.3599999999999s)]
