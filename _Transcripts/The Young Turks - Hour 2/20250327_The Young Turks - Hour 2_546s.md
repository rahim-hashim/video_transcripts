"Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), a Trump-aligned firebrand, slammed House Speaker Mike Johnson over his opposition to a bipartisan bill allowing proxy voting for new parents armed with receipts in a profanity-laced clapback.

The bill, authored by Rep. Brittany Pettersen (D-CO) and co-sponsored by Luna, Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA), and Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), would allow proxy voting for new parents for up to 12 weeks ‚Äî before and after childbirth, if needed."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# 'Let's Play F***ing Hardball!'-- MAGA Republicans FEUD Over Family Values
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo)
*  It's effectively telling members of Congress to women specifically that you either have to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=0.0s)]
*  choose between having a family and representing your constituency or you come up here and vote [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=5.04s)]
*  and put your life and your child's life at risk, depending on if there's medical complications. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=9.28s)]
*  Luna is bucking her Republican leadership by pushing for this rules change. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=14.16s)]
*  There's a potentially ugly fight playing out among House Republicans as we speak, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=18.96s)]
*  and it's between a MAGA Congresswoman that you just heard from, Annapallina Luna, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=26.88s)]
*  who's calling out House Speaker Mike Johnson for blocking efforts to accommodate lawmakers [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=31.44s)]
*  who just had children and want to still carry out their duties as members of the House of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=38.96s)]
*  Representatives. They wanna cast their votes and they wanna be able to do it through proxy voting, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=45.36s)]
*  or remote voting. If there's some sort of family emergency that has come up as a result of the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=52.0s)]
*  fact that they have an infant that they need to care for. And so believe it or not, Luna is the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  12th member of Congress to give birth. I honestly couldn't believe that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=65.12s)]
*  I thought there had been more, but no, only 12 members of Congress at that point when she gave [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  birth had given birth as sitting members of Congress. Now, Democratic Congresswoman [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=75.68s)]
*  from Colorado, Brittany Peterson was the 13th. And because she had an infant to care for, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=81.44000000000001s)]
*  Peterson missed 41 House votes, but she did manage to race back on February 25th to vote on the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  budget blueprint in the House. She voted against it, obviously, as a Democrat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  Now, even though they come from two opposite ends of the political aisle, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=100.88s)]
*  Peterson and Luna are joining forces to essentially sponsor a bill, co-sponsor a bill that would [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=104.88s)]
*  pressure House leadership to adopt rule changes that would allow for new parents to vote remotely, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=112.96s)]
*  also known as proxy voting, for 12 weeks around the birth of the baby. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=119.84s)]
*  So it can happen during a week prior to giving birth, two weeks prior to giving birth, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=125.04s)]
*  12 weeks after giving birth. It doesn't matter, it's 12 weeks around the birth of the baby. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=130.96s)]
*  Now, Luna said lawmakers should not have to choose between recovery and bonding with their [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=135.68s)]
*  baby to come to Washington to vote. We're siloing it, it's very specific. It is to female members [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  who have given birth and male members who have just had a baby. Their spouse has given birth, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=149.28s)]
*  and sometimes they need to be there for that recovery process, explained Luna. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=155.28s)]
*  Now, I agree with Luna entirely. I actually think that members of the House should be able to vote [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=160.72s)]
*  remotely. I think this bill makes perfect sense. I would love for Luna to weigh in, though, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=165.36s)]
*  on the topic of paid family leave. Because if Luna needs to take those 12 weeks off, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=172.24s)]
*  if Peterson needs to take those 12 weeks off, if they pass their votes by proxy, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=178.88s)]
*  but they're in their home state, hometown, whatever, they're still gonna get paid, right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=184.4s)]
*  If they call in sick, it's not like they're gonna worry about not getting paid that day. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=190.56s)]
*  But for Americans, for the vast majority of Americans, we don't have paid family leave. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=195.44s)]
*  Now, there are laws protecting people from getting fired if they need to take leave [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=203.04s)]
*  after having an infant, having a baby. But paid family leave, we don't have that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=207.84s)]
*  And that could be something that Luna can weigh in on, maybe work on. It would give her a lot [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=212.88s)]
*  more credibility on this issue, but I digress. So Luna, again, a MAGA Republican, has been [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=218.4s)]
*  fiercely pushing members of her own party on this. And I commend her for that. I know that's not an [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=224.0s)]
*  easy thing to do. Here's what she told House GOP leadership. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=229.04s)]
*  I've gone to the speaker, both speakers, Kevin McCarthy and the current speaker on this. I've [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=233.52s)]
*  met with them. I've looked at the legality of it. And they said that it was not constitutional [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=240.08s)]
*  because when the Constitution was written, it said that you must be present to establish a quorum, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  right? Well, in an effort to make sure that it's in line with the Constitution, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=248.96s)]
*  we actually removed that. So this will simply allow you to vote, not to establish the quorum. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=252.96s)]
*  When the Constitution was written, it was written by men for men. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  You're right. This place is not built for young families, and it's definitely not built to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=260.96s)]
*  meet the needs of young women. Proxy House voting was allowed during the coronavirus pandemic, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=266.23999999999995s)]
*  but House GOP leaders oppose returning to the practice. The argument is that it was abused. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=272.32s)]
*  Correct. But I would say that that in itself is not a good argument for this because we're [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=277.84s)]
*  siloing it. It's very specific. It is to female members who have given birth and male members [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  who have just had a child, their spouse has given birth. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=286.32s)]
*  And sometimes they need to be there for that recovery process. I mean, everything that we've [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=290.08s)]
*  campaigned on being pro-family, pro-life, yeah, it's a massive slap in the face. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  Damn right. Thank you, Luna. Thank you, Congresswoman Luna. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=300.48s)]
*  Finally, someone calls out the hypocrisy in their own party. Anyone who's willing to do that, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=304.48s)]
*  even if I disagree with the majority of their policy positions, gets kudos for me. Because the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=309.6s)]
*  only way this country is gonna move forward is if we hold our own accountable for the mistakes or [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=315.28s)]
*  the hypocrisy they engage in. But get a load of how House leadership responded to Luna's concerns [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=320.08s)]
*  and what she's calling for here. The House Republican leadership said, quote, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=327.76s)]
*  we sympathize with our colleagues who face circumstances that prevent them from being [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=333.52s)]
*  present. But proxy voting raises serious constitutional questions. It also changes [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=338.4s)]
*  more than two and a half centuries of tradition, abuses the system, and creates the risk of a [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=344.72s)]
*  slippery slope toward more and more members casting votes remotely. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  They did it during COVID. I didn't hear any arguments about 200 years of tradition [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=357.68s)]
*  when they did proxy voting during COVID. Listen, we're not having a conversation [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=364.56s)]
*  about allowing members of Congress to work from home for the entirety of the year. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=371.36s)]
*  We're literally just having a conversation about a single bill that allows new parents [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=378.64s)]
*  12 weeks of still working, but working remotely, casting votes remotely. And by the way, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=385.04s)]
*  I don't really understand where House Speaker Mike Johnson is coming from here. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=392.24s)]
*  What is the issue? Because obviously Luna's a Republican. So do you want her, with the slim [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=396.8s)]
*  majority that you have in the House, you want to maintain a situation in which some Republican [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=402.72s)]
*  members might not make it for a vote on legislation that you value? It doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  And what is the slippery slope argument? I wanna understand what, if you allow new parents to vote [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=417.76s)]
*  remotely around the 12 weeks around the birth of the baby, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=424.08s)]
*  okay, what's the potential slippery slope after that? What could happen? I really don't understand. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  But nonetheless, Luna defended her bill and called Johnson out for [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=438.88s)]
*  casting proxy votes himself during the COVID pandemic. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=443.44s)]
*  She's now resorting to some posts on X. So let's take a look at this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=446.96s)]
*  Mike Johnson is a kind man and his heart is in the right spot, but he's wrong on proxy voting [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  for new parents. Here are some documents showing him voting by proxy in the 117th Congress as late [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=458.0s)]
*  as December of 2022. He argues it's unconstitutional, but has done it several times. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  Since the case is being made to the public via press, I'm going to do the same. And Luna, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=473.76s)]
*  by the way, went even further telling reporters, quote, if people wanna do that, then [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=479.68s)]
*  you have a two seat majority. So good luck with passing anything. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=486.72s)]
*  If they wanna play hardball, let's play effing hardball. Yes, I will allow it. I like hardball. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=491.44s)]
*  Go for it, Luna. I support you in this mission. We'll see what happens, but I agree with her [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=499.92s)]
*  entirely. And Mike Johnson doesn't really have an argument. You can't make a slippery slope [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=504.88s)]
*  argument without citing what the slippery slope would resort to, ultimately. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=509.28s)]
*  And I don't really care about 200 years of tradition. Things change. Technology makes [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=515.12s)]
*  all sorts of things possible. The whole point is to make life easier. So if you genuinely care [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=520.48s)]
*  about supporting families in this country, this is literally the easiest way for Mike Johnson to do [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=527.28s)]
*  it. Let's see if he's up to the cause, but something tells me he might be a hypocrite [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  when it comes to this matter. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BhzwgLWyo&t=538.4s)]
