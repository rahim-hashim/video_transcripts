"The United Auto Workers union on Tuesday hailed President Trump's new tariffs, saying it's necessary "to end the free trade disaster."

Why it matters: With about 1 million members, including retired workers, the UAW is one of the most powerful unions in America.

It has historically supported Democrats, but many of the union's members voted for Trump, seemingly attracted by MAGA's emphasis on "America first."."

# Trump's Auto Tariffs Are Popular With One SURPRISING Person
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA)
*  We are ecstatic to see an administration finally address the unfair trade laws in this country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=0.0s)]
*  These laws have destroyed the American working class. They've destroyed communities in this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=6.48s)]
*  country and virtually every state for decades. Well, that was United Auto Workers President [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=11.52s)]
*  Sean Fain, who is, in fact, praising Donald Trump following his announcement that he will be [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=20.64s)]
*  implementing a 25% tariff on all cars, all vehicles, and auto parts, by the way, that are [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=27.2s)]
*  imported into the United States. Now, according to the Trump White House, this tariff is expected to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=35.36s)]
*  raise $100 billion for the federal government annually, because remember the tariffs are paid [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=42.56s)]
*  to the federal government. And he's using this as justification to essentially cut taxes for the rich [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=48.4s)]
*  but understand how that would work. So these 25% tariffs on automobile imports [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=57.2s)]
*  will lead to us American consumers paying more for cars. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=64.48s)]
*  But at the same time, there's going to be a massive tax cut in which the majority of the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  benefits are gonna go to the wealthiest among us. Things get more expensive for American workers, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  taxes are lowered mostly for the rich. This kind of seems like you're throwing working class people [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=83.76s)]
*  under the bus a little bit, no? Now Sean Fain is celebrating this because I don't know if you guys [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  know this, but historically speaking, unions have not been very favorable to free trade. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=95.2s)]
*  Free trade has actually been pretty disastrous to unionized workers in this country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  So I'm not surprised at all that Sean Fain is supportive of the 25% tariff here. They're gonna [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  look out for the best interest of their union members. So I'm not surprised and I'm not gonna [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=112.32s)]
*  trash him for it at all. But let's talk about what the likely consequences will be in regard [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=117.36s)]
*  to these 25% tariffs. So make no mistake, this will be pretty disastrous for American consumers, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=123.36s)]
*  at least in the short term and possibly in the long term. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=129.04s)]
*  So I say short term because the whole point is to persuade auto manufacturers to manufacture [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=132.88s)]
*  vehicles here in the United States. If they are persuaded to do this in order to avoid that 25% [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=138.56s)]
*  tariff, well, it's gonna take some time, right? To set up shop, to build your factory and get [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=144.48s)]
*  manufacturing rolling. But even then, American workers have certain labor laws that protect [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=149.52s)]
*  them. So there's certain wages that they're guaranteed to make, meaning at least minimum [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  wage. Whereas products, anything being produced outside of the United States could be manufactured [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=162.72s)]
*  through exploited labor that gets paid far less and that's how they keep the cost down. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=172.48s)]
*  So the point is, it's very likely that the price of cars will increase significantly. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=177.04s)]
*  It might remain the case for the long term, unless we have all sorts of cars being manufactured here [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=183.28s)]
*  in the United States, lots of competition to drive prices down, but that would take some time, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=189.76s)]
*  obviously. And that's by the way showing up in Trump's approval ratings. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=194.64s)]
*  Let's go to CNN's Harry Enton and see how Americans are feeling about how Trump's handling [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=201.12s)]
*  the economy. Americans oppose tariffs on Canada. Look at this, 64% of Americans oppose tariffs on [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=205.6s)]
*  Canada. How about Mexico? 59%, 68% of Americans believe he is prioritizing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=212.88s)]
*  tariffs. But look, he should prioritize. Just 30% of Americans believe he should prioritize [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=218.72s)]
*  tariffs. One of the big arguments for tariffs is that they help the American worker, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=226.24s)]
*  So this is a question that got asked. US workers come out ahead with tariffs. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=232.48s)]
*  Look at the low percentage who agree with that. Just 31% of Americans agree with that. Among [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=236.88s)]
*  independents, it's just 33%. Disagree with it that American workers come out ahead with tariffs, 49%. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=243.12s)]
*  So Americans are not giving Donald Trump high marks in regard to his tariff policy, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=249.52s)]
*  and that's for obvious reasons. I mean, not the whole reason, but one of the main reasons why [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=257.12s)]
*  people cast their ballots for Donald Trump is that he made all these lofty promises [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=262.16s)]
*  about lowering inflation. He gets elected and he immediately flips the script [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=266.32s)]
*  downplays his agenda in lowering inflation, even confesses that there's some possibility [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=272.88s)]
*  there could be a recession. And so it doesn't surprise me at all that his tariff policies [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=280.0s)]
*  are not popular. His polling numbers on the economy not doing so great. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=286.88s)]
*  The only area where he's actually doing pretty well is immigration. And [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=293.44s)]
*  I honestly think that's the result of Democrats dropping the ball on the issue. And when you have [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  one party that refuses to even acknowledge the issue, you're gonna resort to supporting the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=304.48s)]
*  other party that has a plan, even if that plan in many cases can be cruel and unjust. Now, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  the backlash to Trump's tariffs has grown so intense that Republican Congressman Don Bacon [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=317.04s)]
*  is now calling for Congress to take back the power of tariffs from the president. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=322.32s)]
*  I don't know if you guys know this, Congress actually used to do things [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=329.44s)]
*  before they ceded power to the executive branch. Get a load of this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=332.24s)]
*  Could Republicans, Congressman, the Republicans in Congress specifically be doing more to push [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=335.44s)]
*  the president to try to deescalate his trade war? What leverage do you have? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=341.36s)]
*  Well, in Article 1 in the Constitution, really, tariffs should be a congressional [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=346.48s)]
*  initiated action. So this should come from Congress. However, I think we made a mistake. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=351.44s)]
*  In the past, we passed legislation that gave the president some temporary tariff authorities. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  And I think we should look back and maybe restore the power back to Congress and take away the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=362.0s)]
*  authorizations that we've allowed the presidents, not just President Trump, but President Biden, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  President Obama before him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=373.36s)]
*  And look, don't take Bacon at his word because, let's take a look at this. Just two weeks ago, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  Bacon voted for a rules resolution that blocked measures attempting to take tariff authority back [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=387.6s)]
*  from being fast tracked for the rest of the year. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=396.0s)]
*  So which one is it? Congressman Bacon, which one is it? Do you want Congress to have a say or not? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=398.32s)]
*  And look, honestly, he just wants to separate himself a little bit from [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=407.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's unpopular policies so he doesn't get hit politically. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=413.04s)]
*  But he doesn't actually want to do something about it. Now, let's get into the nitty gritty on these [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=418.56s)]
*  tariffs, though, okay? So the countries that absolutely will be affected by these tariffs [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=422.88s)]
*  include Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and Canada. So those four countries account for a whopping [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=426.88s)]
*  75% of all US automobile imports. By the way, the most American car, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=433.84s)]
*  most American made car, believe it or not, happens to be Tesla. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=441.2s)]
*  And so is this a way of incentivizing the purchase of Teslas as opposed to other brands? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=446.0s)]
*  Maybe, maybe. But Germany is also a big exporter of cars to the United States. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  So the US imports a huge volume of cars and car parts into the country. Nearly half of all vehicles [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  sold in the United States are imported, as well as nearly 60% of the parts and vehicles assembled [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  in the United States. The US last year imported nearly 8 million cars and light trucks worth [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=474.8s)]
*  $244 billion. So these tariffs obviously could make car buying a lot more expensive for American [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=482.56s)]
*  consumers. I'll give you some specifics or some estimates here. So for instance, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=489.52s)]
*  Jonathan Smoke, who's a chief economist at Cox Automotive, a market research firm, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=494.16s)]
*  estimated that a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada would add $3,000 even to the cost of [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=500.8s)]
*  a car built in the United States since automakers depend on many foreign components. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=509.12s)]
*  Remember, a lot of these car parts are manufactured in other countries and are imported, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  even if the car is being manufactured here in the US. And tariffs, by the way, would add $6,000 [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=519.76s)]
*  on average to the prices of cars made in Mexico and Canada or Canada, a category that includes [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=526.48s)]
*  vehicles like the Toyota Tacoma pickup, gasoline and electric versions of the Chevy Equinox, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=532.88s)]
*  and several models of Ram pickups, according to Cox estimates. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=540.64s)]
*  On the other hand, Trump's tariffs or tariff brinkmanship has led to at least one auto company [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=545.76s)]
*  announcing that they're going to invest more in the United States. Although, honestly, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=552.56s)]
*  I don't even know if I want to give Trump credit for it because this was already in motion before [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=557.28s)]
*  Trump was elected. But nonetheless, Hyundai, which is a South Korean company, announced this [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=561.92s)]
*  week on Monday that they are going to invest about $21 billion into the United States over three [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=568.24s)]
*  years, including a $6 billion steel mill in Louisiana. So there you have it. We'll see how [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=575.04s)]
*  this plays out, but people are not loving it. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=581.5999999999999s)]
*  the swings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWuWEtT3sA&t=586.56s)]
