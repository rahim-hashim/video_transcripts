TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

*  that Biden might die in office. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=15.64s)]
*  The book titled Fight Inside the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=17.96s)]

*  including some dramatic revelations [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=30.8s)]
*  that have already begun to leak. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=33.64s)]
*  They're touted as dramatic [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=37.28s)]
*  revelations, I guess interesting. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=38.68s)]
*  But I want to know, Cenk, do you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=40.44s)]

*  Will anybody care at this point? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think that it's important [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  for a couple of reasons. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=54.92s)]
*  No, I'm not really surprised by it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Obviously, I mean, but [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=59.0s)]
*  although there is that funny part [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=60.08s)]
*  that the only people who started [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=62.0s)]
*  planning on buying leaving before [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=63.96s)]
*  us, because Young Turks started [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=66.04s)]
*  the petition, I think in the middle [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=68.16s)]
*  of 2023, when we were considered [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=70.5s)]
*  like radicals, these crazy, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  crazy leftists who think that Joe [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=75.28s)]
*  Biden isn't young, these lunatics [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=77.72s)]
*  don't think that he's in his 30s. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=80.36s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Biden team's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=87.56s)]
*  already planning, yeah, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  our guy's cooked. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=90.48s)]
*  Okay, so let's figure out what [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  we're going to do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=92.72s)]
*  What's our emergency plan, one, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=93.56s)]
*  two, three? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=95.2s)]
*  But the whole time, all of them [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=96.04s)]
*  are not only lying, but as an [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=99.64s)]
*  insider told us, Michael LaRosa, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=102.68s)]
*  check out the interview on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=106.28s)]
*  Young Turks on YouTube, he's like, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=108.48s)]
*  yeah, we were gaslighting everyone. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=111.72s)]
*  And then they were, not him, but [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=114.92s)]
*  the Biden team was bullying [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  the reporters. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=119.24s)]
*  You better say he's wrong and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  dynamic, but behind the scenes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  You better say he's the best [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  candidate, otherwise he's going to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=126.36s)]
*  be consequences, you're going to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  lose your access, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  So while they are doing plans on, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=130.44s)]
*  yeah, his brain is falling out of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=132.44s)]
*  left or right ear, which ear, okay? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=134.28s)]
*  And they're out there going, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  you better not say anything that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=138.84s)]
*  he said, in mental decline. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=140.72s)]
*  Giant, giant, giant liars, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=143.0s)]
*  Wizard of Oz moment, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=145.88s)]
*  you pull the curtain back, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  you see who the wizard is. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  So that's super important, but [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  I think the implications for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris are also important and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=152.84s)]
*  interesting, but we'll get to that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=154.76s)]
*  in a little bit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  As some excerpts from the book, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=157.4s)]
*  first reported by The Guardian, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=159.04s)]
*  claimed Democrats had doubts Biden [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=160.76s)]
*  would make it to November 2024 as [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=162.64s)]
*  early as January of last year. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=164.44s)]
*  They were discussing how to handle [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=166.48s)]

*  Here are the quotes, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=171.0s)]
*  Democratic official stage hush, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=172.16s)]

*  is early as 2023. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=179.72s)]
*  I wasn't just concerned about [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=181.2s)]
*  political strategy, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  the authors report that Harris's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=184.44s)]
*  former communications director, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=186.56s)]
*  Jamal Simmons, even drew up a death [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=188.84s)]
*  pool roster of federal judges who [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=191.12s)]
*  might swear in Harris just in case. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Book says Simmons never told Harris [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=196.84s)]
*  about the document, but left [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  instructions to alert him [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  immediately if something happened [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=202.0s)]
*  to Biden. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=203.96s)]
*  Do we believe that he didn't tell [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  Harris, just said, hey, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=208.52s)]
*  let me know if something happens [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=210.12s)]
*  to Biden, number one. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=212.0s)]
*  Does any of this reflect negatively [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  on Kamala Harris? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=215.56s)]
*  Of course, the rules are different [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=216.68s)]
*  when there's a woman who might [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=218.8s)]
*  ascend to a higher office here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=220.56s)]
*  No, no, I wouldn't blame her for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  planning at all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=224.44s)]
*  In fact, I blame her for [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=225.12s)]
*  the opposite. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=226.52s)]

*  Look, I'll be honest with you, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=231.56s)]
*  I don't know if this makes me [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  a bad person. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=233.28s)]
*  But if I was Biden's vice [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=233.8s)]
*  president from day one, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=234.88s)]
*  I'd come up with all my policies, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=236.08s)]
*  I'd have everything ready to go. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=238.16s)]
*  I mean, who are we kidding? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=240.8s)]
*  I mean, he had issues back in 2020. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=243.2s)]
*  Again, people, Michael La Rosa, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=245.76s)]
*  check out that interview, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  talking about on day one, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=249.68s)]
*  they're talking about, yeah, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=251.24s)]
*  I mean, let's be careful with where [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=253.28s)]
*  we put him out and all that stuff. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=255.4s)]
*  They knew, they knew. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=257.8s)]
*  So to me, I'm like, Jesus, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=259.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris's team keeps saying, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=260.92s)]
*  we only had three months. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=262.92s)]
*  You had four years to prepare, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  besides which, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=266.76s)]
*  you're a politician. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=267.64000000000004s)]
*  Don't you already know your [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  policies? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=270.24s)]
*  Don't you already know what you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=271.04s)]
*  want to fight for? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=272.36s)]
*  Why did you have to focus group it [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=273.6s)]
*  in the last three months? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  So no, I think Kamala Harris was [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=276.56s)]
*  a disaster and should have been [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=278.48s)]
*  preparing all along. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=280.44s)]
*  So they're criticizing her for [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=282.04s)]
*  the wrong thing, in my opinion. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Ramesh, what do you think? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=284.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, remember everybody [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=287.88s)]
*  when we all heard that Biden would [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=290.12s)]
*  be a transitional president, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=292.28s)]
*  I believe those were his own words. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  So, it's all just sort of like [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=296.84s)]
*  stories like this just show to me [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=300.67999999999995s)]
*  how much of an insider party, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=304.08s)]
*  the Democratic Party, at least [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=307.0s)]
*  the mainstream of the Democratic [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  Party and the parts of the party [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=312.64s)]
*  that are tied to the donor class [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=315.2s)]
*  really are, it's inside baseball, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=317.76s)]
*  the idea is, we'll just put this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=320.64s)]
*  person for now, then this person [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  will be next, then this person [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=325.24s)]
*  will be next, rather than [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  recognizing the pulse of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=329.4s)]
*  country, which in 2016 and in 2020 [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=331.47999999999996s)]
*  was clearly highly, highly [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=334.28s)]
*  populist and economically [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=336.36s)]
*  populist oriented. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=338.28s)]
*  And the reason really why Trump [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=340.64s)]
*  did not win that reelection in 2020 [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=342.64s)]
*  was because the economy was tanking [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  because of his horrible [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=347.24s)]
*  mismanagement of COVID, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=348.8s)]
*  if we all remember this. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=350.36s)]
*  So, I mean, for me, it's sort of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=351.48s)]
*  like seeing this is a little bit [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=353.44s)]
*  like watching a novella or [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  watching a soap opera or something. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=357.44s)]
*  But this is just like elite [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=359.8s)]
*  wrangling from inside. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=361.56s)]
*  And at the end of the day for me, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=363.36s)]
*  the big, big question is who is [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=365.36s)]
*  going to lead the opposition to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=367.28s)]
*  what we are seeing happening here? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=369.08s)]
*  In my opinion, we're only seeing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=371.36s)]
*  really two members of the United [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=373.2s)]
*  States Congress get out there and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=374.88s)]
*  show what they're all about. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=376.56s)]
*  And that's Bernie and AOC. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=377.96s)]
*  And you wonder if this book will [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=380.96s)]
*  perhaps bring the focus back to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=383.0s)]
*  the Democratic Party and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=385.08s)]
*  their need to get their acts [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=386.56s)]
*  together. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  Were you going to say something [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=389.23999999999995s)]
*  else, Cenk? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=389.88s)]
*  No. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay, so there's other claims in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=391.84s)]
*  the book Democratic strategists [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=393.88s)]
*  created multiple scenarios, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=396.0s)]
*  not just in case Biden got sick or [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=397.84s)]
*  worse, but even if he won [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=399.67999999999995s)]
*  primaries, then dropped out, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=401.12s)]
*  according to the authors. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=402.96s)]
*  They quote, wanted to make sure [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=404.28s)]
*  the party was ready for [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=406.24s)]
*  every possible circumstance. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=407.58s)]
*  If Biden launched his campaign and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=409.92s)]
*  then stepped aside before [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  the primaries, if he won a bunch [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  of primaries and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=414.64s)]
*  then could not continue. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=415.32s)]
*  If he secured enough delegates for [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  winning the nomination but [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=418.28s)]
*  dropped out before winning a vote [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=419.64s)]
*  at the convention. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=421.32s)]
*  And if he left a vacancy at [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=422.48s)]
*  the top of the ticket after taking [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=423.91999999999996s)]
*  the nomination. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  So it's out there now or [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=427.28s)]
*  it will be shortly in book form. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=429.12s)]
*  Expect these questions, I guess, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=433.08s)]
*  are you swirling around that White [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=434.96s)]
*  House and the Democratic leadership, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=437.23999999999995s)]
*  many of whom still remain the party [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=439.79999999999995s)]
*  as they struggle about a level of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  trust or lack thereof inside at [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  the top of the Democratic party? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  Cenk, you first. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=450.28s)]
*  Yeah, so to me there's only one [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=452.35999999999996s)]
*  overwhelming lesson from all this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=454.67999999999995s)]
*  Do not trust people in power, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=457.79999999999995s)]
*  telling you how great and amazing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=460.32s)]
*  leadership is and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=463.8s)]
*  the people at the top are and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=464.92s)]
*  how they're great men. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=466.88s)]
*  And you shouldn't question them, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=468.8s)]
*  you should just obey. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=470.84s)]
*  You should just comply with all of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=472.4s)]
*  their demands and requests of you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=474.24s)]
*  This is what they've been telling [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=476.76s)]
*  Democratic voters for [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=478.48s)]
*  my entire lifetime. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=479.76s)]
*  Do not question [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=481.44s)]
*  Democratic leadership. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=482.28s)]
*  They literally told me during [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=483.84s)]
*  the Obama years, Cenk, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=485.28s)]
*  he's playing four dimensional [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=486.4s)]
*  chess you wouldn't understand. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=488.0s)]
*  And what they say that in response [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=490.6s)]
*  to they said no, no, don't [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=492.52s)]
*  criticize him about drilling off [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=494.08s)]
*  in the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  Oops, it blew up later. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=497.28s)]
*  And don't criticize him for this, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=499.28s)]
*  don't criticize him for that, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  because at the end, he's going to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=502.79999999999995s)]
*  do the magical Jiu Jitsu move where [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  he passes all of our policy [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=506.88s)]
*  proposals, not just Obamacare. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  And how many of those did he pass [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=511.0s)]
*  after Obamacare? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=513.8s)]
*  Approximately zero. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=516.76s)]
*  There was never any secret plan. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=518.92s)]
*  Like Alex Jones kept telling [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=520.4399999999999s)]
*  everybody on the right, he's going [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=521.88s)]
*  to put you in FEMA camps. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  And I always ask, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=525.2s)]
*  are you in a FEMA camp? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=526.12s)]
*  If you're not, then maybe you [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=528.08s)]
*  shouldn't believe Alex Jones. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=529.36s)]
*  But at the same time, when people [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=531.12s)]
*  in Democratic leadership told you, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=532.76s)]
*  don't worry, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  Obama's going to pass every [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=535.36s)]
*  Democratic policy because he's [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=536.64s)]
*  playing four dimensional chess. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=538.08s)]
*  Did he pass them? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=539.32s)]
*  No, did Joe Biden pass him? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=540.36s)]
*  No. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=542.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay, so did they do what their [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=543.4s)]
*  donors wanted? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=545.48s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=546.52s)]
*  Lift the curtain back. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=549.4000000000001s)]
*  Right, that's the Wizard of Oz is [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=550.7199999999999s)]
*  not a magical great man. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=553.12s)]
*  He's just a guy looking out for [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=555.52s)]
*  his interests and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=557.2399999999999s)]
*  the interests of people who paid [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  him. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=560.04s)]
*  That's how the real world works. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=560.64s)]
*  And on both sides. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=563.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we've spoken at [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=564.16s)]
*  length across many times when I've [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=565.7199999999999s)]
*  joined you all about the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  incoherence that the Democratic [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=569.0s)]
*  Party represents between what its [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  donor class may wish for, which is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  sort of same old extractive [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  capitalism, maybe some version of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=576.56s)]
*  techno feudalism that's [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=578.5999999999999s)]
*  capitalism with a couple of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=580.12s)]
*  handouts here and there to kind of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  signal some sort of liberalism or [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=583.5600000000001s)]
*  some virtue. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=585.7s)]
*  And the incoherence of that because [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=586.88s)]
*  what working class, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=589.72s)]
*  let alone progressive people, but [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=591.5200000000001s)]
*  just working class, working poor [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=594.14s)]
*  people want is at complete tension [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=596.64s)]
*  and at odds with what this sort of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=599.12s)]
*  donor messaging. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=601.4000000000001s)]
*  And people don't really want their [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=603.2800000000001s)]
*  intelligence to be insulted. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=605.2800000000001s)]
*  And now of course, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=607.2800000000001s)]
*  we're facing an administration that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=608.2s)]
*  is not just insulting many of our [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=610.0s)]
*  intelligence, but is attacking many [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=611.8s)]
*  US citizens and lawful immigrants. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=614.36s)]
*  And so we just got to face it for [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=616.96s)]
*  what it is. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=619.44s)]
*  I am waiting and praying for [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=620.24s)]
*  someone to emerge or some entity to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=622.32s)]
*  emerge that has a coherent vision [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=624.96s)]
*  that is populist and is actually [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=627.52s)]
*  aligned with what people in this [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=629.92s)]
*  country want and need. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=632.32s)]
*  That's what I'm waiting for. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=634.16s)]
*  You're here, we're all waiting for [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=635.88s)]
*  you though. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=637.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90zGbafL72o&t=638.4s)]
