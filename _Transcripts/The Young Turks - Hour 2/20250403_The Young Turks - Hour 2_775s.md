"The White House is so frustrated by the lack of clear and fast communications by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agency that it has set up a parallel press shop, five top Trump administration sources tell Axios.

Driving the news: The problem surfaced in February, after it took two days for the Health and Human Services Department to acknowledge ‚Äî by tweet ‚Äî that a West Texas child had become the first person to die in the measles outbreak."

# REPORT: The White House Is FED UP With RFK Jr.
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko)
*  There's a measles outbreak in Texas at the moment in which a child is reported to have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=0.0s)]
*  died. Do you have concerns about that? And have you asked Secretary Kennedy to look into [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=4.8s)]
*  that? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=9.24s)]
*  Well, why don't we, Bobby, you wanna speak on that? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=10.24s)]
*  We are following the measles epidemic every day. I think there's 124 people who have contracted [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  measles at this point, mainly in Case County, Texas. It's not unusual, you have measles [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=21.2s)]
*  outbreaks every year. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=26.36s)]
*  The Trump administration has to some extent soured on Health and Human Services Secretary [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=30.0s)]
*  R.F.K. Jr. because of the fact that his messaging on the measles outbreak has not been very [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=35.8s)]
*  direct. It hasn't been clear, and they were expecting more. Now we're learning the White [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  House is furious that he didn't put out an official statement for days after a child [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  died of measles for the first time in over a decade in the United States. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=53.8s)]
*  So look, we've previously shared the details of the measles outbreak in the US in addition [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=58.8s)]
*  to R.F.K. Jr.'s lackluster response to the very serious issue. Now this report from Axios [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=63.68s)]
*  shares details about the White House's frustrations. Now, about two days, Cenk, after that child [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  died from measles, R.F.K. Jr. finally put out a statement. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=78.2s)]
*  He wrote, my heart goes out to the families impacted by the current measles outbreak in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=82.4s)]
*  Texas. I recognize the serious impact of this outbreak on families, children, and health [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=86.04s)]
*  care workers. Ending the measles outbreak is a top priority for me and my extraordinary [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=90.44s)]
*  team at HHS. And then I'm gonna tell you what he did after that, but before I do thoughts. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=95.76s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm torn on this story cuz this is definitely a hatchet job. Somebody's trying [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=102.4s)]
*  to knife him within the administration, but it could still be true, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  So we're gonna get into the details and say not the measles part, the measles part is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=112.12s)]
*  clear that was all public. But the part that Anna's about to tell you, I'm also curious [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=115.48s)]
*  what you guys think of this poll. And I always mention when I'm curious, how concerned are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=119.44s)]
*  you with R.F.K. as HHS secretary? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  So that's in the live chat, so not at all slightly, moderately, extremely. I'm curious [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=125.34s)]
*  how what you guys are thinking about him. So let's see if they have an effective attack [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=130.44s)]
*  against him or not. Let's find out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=136.94s)]
*  So again, let's just summarize what we know so far. Child dies of measles. R.F.K. Jr. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=138.44s)]
*  does not put out a statement until two days after that. And then two days after he puts [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=145.12s)]
*  out a statement, the secretary wrote an op-ed for Fox News. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=149.96s)]
*  Measles outbreak is called to action for all of us. That was the headline for the op-ed [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=156.92s)]
*  piece. Not the quickest response, obviously. And according to a White House official involved [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=161.16s)]
*  with the measles response at the time, the White House was like, where the F is the statement? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=167.24s)]
*  CNN was blaring this chiron about how Kennedy was silent. And there was just nothing from [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=174.84s)]
*  the department because of Stephanie. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  Now who's Stephanie? Looks like Stephanie is the real person they wanna do a hatchet [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=183.96s)]
*  job on. So Stephanie is gonna come up a lot in this story. Her name is Stephanie Spear. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=187.96s)]
*  She is R.F.K. Jr.'s deputy chief of staff who has actually served as his advisor for [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=194.18s)]
*  more than a decade. They seem to be very close. The White House feels that she is the one [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=199.38s)]
*  basically derailing the agency, that she has too much influence, too much power over R.F.K. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=204.74s)]
*  Jr. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=210.74s)]
*  And they claim that she's basically stopping HHS external communications, restricting access [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=211.74s)]
*  to Kennedy, and even insisting on controlling messaging while also under communicating. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=217.78s)]
*  So Axios writes that since the measles debacle, the White House communications team has handled [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=224.14s)]
*  more press relations on behalf of HHS than any other department and often has acted as [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  a contact between reporters and the agency. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  So the agency itself is supposed to be communicating with reporters and getting their message out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  But apparently you have the White House communications team doing that instead or in lieu of the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=245.17999999999998s)]
*  communications team for HHS. One White House advisor told Axios, this shouldn't be the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=252.86s)]
*  White House's job, but here we are. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=257.5s)]
*  Another White House official told the Daily Mail, I've been in meetings where they've been [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=260.7s)]
*  roasted for effing everything up. They just don't seem to communicate very well. I'm sorry, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=265.54s)]
*  HHS staffers kind of do their own thing and we find out about it on TV versus going through [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  the White House like other agencies and departments do. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=279.04s)]
*  And it's not just in regard to the measles outbreak apparently. On March 9th, a department [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=282.8s)]
*  insider leaked a Reuters article, leaked two Reuters I should say. So a department insider [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=287.36s)]
*  leaked two Reuters that the CDC planned to study unsupported claims of a link between [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=293.8s)]
*  vaccines and autism. Health and Human Services refused to comment initially at Spears direction. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  The White House got involved and forced a response. And by the way, it was also reported [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=307.02s)]
*  last week that the study would actually be carried out by a guy named David Greer. And [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=312.16s)]
*  he's apparently a long discredited vaccine skeptic, not a good look at all, especially [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=320.48s)]
*  since we're in the middle of a measles outbreak. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=325.2s)]
*  That's super dangerous. There's a kid who died. This is not good. Now his medical license [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=327.92s)]
*  was by the way suspended in Maryland for claims of endangering children with autism. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=333.48s)]
*  And when he was reached out for comment by the press, no one would respond. And I have [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  more examples for you, but that's the gist of it, Cenk. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=345.6s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm a little skeptical. So let me explain why. Stephanie Spear was a Democrat [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=349.12s)]
*  at some point. I don't know what she is now. And so I've seen people within the Trump team [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=356.26s)]
*  try to push her out before because they don't trust her because of that. So now, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=362.96s)]
*  now the story keeps quoting the White House to White House, but there is no [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=369.2s)]
*  the White House. There's different actors within the White House. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=373.52s)]
*  So White House officially says, no, we have no problems at HHS. Meanwhile, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=377.04s)]
*  these people are leaking from inside the White House. So what that usually means is, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  it's someone who's trying to remove Stephanie Spear. It's an internal conflict and an internal [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=385.6s)]
*  political opponent, right? So then you look at the specifics. Yes, but did they get her, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=392.32s)]
*  right? First of all, David Dreyer or whatever his name is, Guy, or sorry, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=397.28s)]
*  that doesn't have anything to do with her. That's RFK Jr's decision. We come back to that, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=401.92s)]
*  So the measles, again, that's more on RFK Jr than it is necessarily on Stephanie Spear. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=407.12s)]
*  And then so the main complaint they have is she's a little slow. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=412.88s)]
*  Okay, by the way, that could be a real issue, especially with the measles outbreak, two days, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=417.28s)]
*  etc. But is it enough of an issue that the White House would be super concerned and want to throw [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=421.2s)]
*  one of their own under the bus? It's hard to believe, to be honest. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=428.96s)]
*  No way. Yeah, no way. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=431.68s)]
*  Especially considering all the other like dramas, controversy, scandals that have come up during the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump administration. Usually they just ignore it and they move forward. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=438.56s)]
*  Look, you've got to separate out whether it's a real issue and why they're doing it, right? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=442.8s)]
*  So if Pete Hegseth was a couple of days late in responding to X, Y, or Z, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=447.76s)]
*  would there be stories in Politico about it? It depends. Does he have political enemies within [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  the White House? If he does, yes, but probably he doesn't, so they wouldn't. I mean, Pete Hegseth is [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=458.24s)]
*  Signalgate, 10,000 times worse and heating a fire. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  Mike Waltz is still in the administration. He's the one who added Atlantic reporter [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=466.4s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg to said Signalgate conversation. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=471.68s)]
*  Yeah, so that's why I'm super skeptical about this story. It seems like, and by the way, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=475.84s)]
*  it happens in every administration, somebody leaks against the other person who's their political [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=480.32s)]
*  rival, etc. So on the other hand, so how's he doing? Well, obviously I wanted a better response on [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=484.08s)]
*  measles. Am I surprised they were late as they were probably thinking, should we or shouldn't we? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=491.12s)]
*  Right? Yeah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=496.56s)]
*  I'm not surprised. This David Guyer guy, of course a disaster, but what do you like? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=497.68s)]
*  Anna, I don't know. When I see an article, and then he brought in this guy, which was shocking. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=504.0s)]
*  They literally used the word- [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=509.35999999999996s)]
*  But it's not shocking. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=510.55999999999995s)]
*  Of course it's not shocking. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=511.44s)]
*  It is not shocking given what RFK Jr.'s whole identity is. Look, he has put out some statements [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  that I agree with in regard to the FDA being corrupt or certain food dyes or chemicals being [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  in the food that Americans consume and how it's making us sick. Those are the good parts of RFK [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=525.8399999999999s)]
*  Jr. But that's not what RFK Jr. is really known for. RFK Jr. is known for his vaccine skepticism. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=530.48s)]
*  Okay? And so now all of a sudden there are White House officials or members of the Trump White [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=538.0s)]
*  House who are like, this doesn't look good. There's a vaccine skeptic who's gonna study [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=544.32s)]
*  the link between vaccines and autism. You can tell me the Democrats are concerned about that, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=549.04s)]
*  but you can't tell me that the Trump administration is concerned about that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=553.76s)]
*  How do you pick an RFK Jr. and get surprised when he brings in a vaccine skeptic? That's why I'm a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=557.2s)]
*  hatchet job skeptic here in this story. So this is some internal BS that's going on here. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=564.48s)]
*  And in terms of the substance of bringing in Geier, A, not at all surprising. B, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=569.68s)]
*  if he hands off the entire policy to him, we got a policy paper and this genius tells us that we [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=575.44s)]
*  shouldn't do vaccines. Hell no, hell no. If he really wants to put out that thing, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=580.32s)]
*  they're gonna block him in a hundred different ways anyway. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  What he should do is get that guy and an actual scientist and have them debate nationally. That [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=588.4s)]
*  would do more for people actually finding out about this than any study this guy's gonna publish [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=594.56s)]
*  at HHS, etc, etc. But nobody does anything in a balanced way. And lastly, all this stuff is tiny [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=601.52s)]
*  compared to RFK Jr. is at HHS. He could insist on negotiating drug prices. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=611.04s)]
*  And the American consumers would save trillions of dollars, not even billions, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=618.7199999999999s)]
*  trillions of dollars. That's what he should do. I asked about it after Donald Trump's joint [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=622.8s)]
*  address to the nation. And he said we're gonna work on drug prices, but he didn't say that they [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=630.16s)]
*  were going to negotiate with the drug companies at Medicare. And by the way- [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  Come on. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=639.92s)]
*  I know. So it's- [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  It's just so lame. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=641.76s)]
*  So that's why I don't believe him. I don't think it's gonna happen. They're not gonna do anything [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=643.52s)]
*  with drug prices. And then finally, if you remember the first thing he did when he went to HHS was he [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  declared anti-Semitism to be a health problem. I mean, it's the most important issue in America. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=651.52s)]
*  Yeah. My mom's sick right now and I keep thinking it's anti-Semitism that did this to her. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=657.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=662.16s)]
*  Apparently RFK Jr. is- Unbelievable. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=662.9599999999999s)]
*  So last thing, guys, you can see us disagreeing with people and their policies [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=665.36s)]
*  while being honest to you about that story and where it's coming from. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=670.16s)]
*  Yep. I mean, we've got less than four minutes, so- [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=673.2s)]
*  Okay, so look, in the bonus episode, we're gonna do some fun stories. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=678.0s)]
*  We're gonna do all of the remaining stories. That's what we're gonna do. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=682.32s)]
*  Yeah, so number one, a surprising Biden insider comes out with juicy details [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=684.48s)]
*  of how bad a shape he was in when he was debating. Although he's a fascinating guy that says [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=691.84s)]
*  things on both sides. And then Obama apparently had a secret plan against Kamala Harris. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=699.68s)]
*  He does not like Kamala. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=704.96s)]
*  Wow, interesting. So I say wow, although I told you guys that was happening when it was happening. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=706.48s)]
*  And all the Democratic loyalists said, you're crazy. That's a conspiracy theory. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=713.76s)]
*  No, to be fair to those folks, because I'm part of that group, I didn't believe that Obama [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=718.4s)]
*  was out for Kamala. I thought he liked Kamala, to be honest with you. And I also, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=725.28s)]
*  I think the reason why I thought that is because he slipped up and basically called her hot when [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  he was president, remember? Yeah, I know. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=735.28s)]
*  But look, guys, there's certain telltale things that when you see X, you should know that it [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=737.52s)]
*  means Y, right? So when I do the predictions on the show, what I'm trying to get you to see [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=745.12s)]
*  is that things are predictable, right? If there are certain patterns and I don't think that they're [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=751.12s)]
*  that complicated. And that's why I was kind of amazed at mainstream media's reaction [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=757.84s)]
*  when Obama did the couple of things that he did both against Biden and Kamala. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=764.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=767.92s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. Totally not true, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=768.64s)]
*  but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pOLThz0Zko&t=772.8s)]
