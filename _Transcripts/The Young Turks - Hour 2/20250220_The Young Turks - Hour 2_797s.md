"Critics of overspending at the Pentagon were excited to see a Washington Post piece, first published yesterday, that initially gave the impression that the Trump administration was entertaining the idea of imposing substantial cuts in the Pentagon budget.

A revised version of the piece (same link), updatedThursday morning, opens as follows:

‚ÄúDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered senior leaders at the Pentagon and throughout the U.S. military to develop plans for cutting 8 percent from the defense budget in each of the next five years, according to a memo obtained by The Washington Post and officials familiar with the matter ‚Äî a striking proposal certain to face internal resistance and strident bipartisan opposition in Congress.‚Äù"

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump Says He‚Äôs CUTTING Pentagon Budget. But The Devil‚Äôs In The Details.
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0)
*  Tonight, President Trump's budget [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=0.0s)]
*  acts preparing to swing at [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=2.24s)]
*  the largest agency in [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=3.72s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=5.0s)]
*  With deep cuts at the Pentagon now [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=6.58s)]
*  on the horizon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=8.58s)]
*  Sources tell ABC News Defense [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=9.84s)]
*  Secretary Pete Hegseth has asked [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=11.76s)]
*  top Pentagon officials to draw [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=14.0s)]
*  plans for a sweeping 8% cut. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  The department hasn't seen cuts [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=18.18s)]
*  this deep in more than a decade. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=19.84s)]
*  So deep, but [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  it won't put your ass to sleep. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  The question is, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  what are the details, Cenk? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Are we going to see Pentagon cuts [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=27.92s)]
*  in areas where it really matters? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Or is this going to be [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=32.24s)]
*  a ham-handed approach similar to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=33.24s)]
*  what we've been seeing with [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=34.92s)]
*  the firing of federal government [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=36.36s)]
*  employees? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=38.2s)]
*  Well, there is a memo out now [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=39.32s)]
*  ordering the Pentagon to cut their [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  budget pretty significantly as was [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=42.92s)]
*  just revealed in that clip. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=45.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, seeing Pete Hegseth as [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Secretary of Defense in his [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=49.6s)]
*  official role was funny every time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=51.0s)]
*  But having said that, I actually [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  agree with this parts of this plan. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  In fact, I agree with several [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=56.88s)]
*  parts of this plan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  But it also has a couple of parts [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=59.72s)]
*  that I definitely do not agree [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=61.36s)]
*  with and that are problematic. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  So let's dive into it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  All right, so [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=65.48s)]
*  let me give you all the details. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=66.0s)]
*  So here's what we do know as of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=67.12s)]
*  right now thanks to this memo [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=69.36s)]
*  obtained by the Washington Post. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=74.48s)]
*  ordered senior leaders at [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=76.76s)]
*  the Pentagon and throughout [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=78.4s)]
*  the US military to develop plans [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=80.36s)]
*  for cutting 8% from the defense [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=82.4s)]
*  budget in each of the next five [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=84.48s)]
*  years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=86.56s)]
*  So that is significant. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=88.12s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=89.36s)]
*  Now the Pentagon budget for [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=90.36s)]
*  2025 is about $850 billion. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=93.4s)]
*  And if this directive is actually [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=96.84s)]
*  adopted in full, those cuts would [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=99.12s)]
*  include tens of billions of dollars [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=101.56s)]
*  in each of the next five years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=104.08s)]
*  Now the memo includes a list of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=106.6s)]
*  17 categories that the Trump [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=108.64s)]
*  administration wants exempted from [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=110.76s)]
*  the budget cuts. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=113.44s)]
*  Among them are operations at [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=114.32s)]
*  the southern US border, operations [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=116.4s)]
*  to combat transnational criminal [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=119.08s)]
*  organizations in the Western [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=121.4s)]
*  hemisphere, modernization of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=123.56s)]
*  nuclear weapons and missile [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=126.0s)]
*  defense, acquisition of submarines, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=128.04s)]
*  one-way attack drones and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=130.96s)]
*  other munitions, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=132.96s)]
*  the Pentagon's audit. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=134.56s)]
*  So they want to ensure that there's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=136.32s)]
*  still money to audit the Pentagon, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=138.56s)]
*  which makes me very happy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=141.12s)]
*  Now Hegseth ordered the proposed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=143.08s)]
*  cuts to be drawn up by Monday. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=145.2s)]
*  Exactly, these cuts will be [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  carried out is pretty unclear at [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=149.16s)]
*  the moment, totally unclear. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=151.28s)]
*  And by the way, there's some [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=153.2s)]
*  indication that any money saved [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  could actually be spent on defense [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=157.72s)]
*  projects anyway. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=160.44s)]
*  So first of all, in his memo, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=162.16s)]
*  Hegseth said the request for [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=164.4s)]
*  proposed cuts constitutes a relook [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  at the Pentagon budget. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=169.28s)]
*  The branches of service, he wrote, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=171.28s)]
*  should fund what they need for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=173.76s)]
*  wartime tempo and offset that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  financially by cutting low impact [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=178.0s)]
*  items such as diversity, equity and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=180.48s)]
*  inclusion programs and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=183.2s)]
*  climate change studies. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=185.04s)]
*  Additionally, Robert Seleses, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=187.16s)]
*  a senior Pentagon official said in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=189.6s)]
*  a statement that the money saved [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=192.2s)]
*  could be realigned to pay for [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=194.56s)]
*  new priorities in the Trump [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=196.6s)]
*  administration, including the iron [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  dome for America. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=201.16s)]
*  Trump's catchphrase is, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump's catchphrase for [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=204.84s)]
*  an expansive missile defense [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=206.28s)]
*  system, that sum could amount to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  $50 billion in next year's budget, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  he said. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  I can't believe that that would [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  only cost $50 billion. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  The US is massive, obviously. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=216.4s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  Here's what they mean by that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=219.96s)]
*  So I thought the same thing, so [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  I looked into a little bit more. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=222.44000000000003s)]
*  They mean that 8% savings are about [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=223.72000000000003s)]
*  $50 billion and they could be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=226.28000000000003s)]
*  realigned towards iron dome. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=228.72000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so that made me think several [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=231.4s)]
*  things, okay, so $50 billion. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=233.56s)]
*  When I started tweeting about it and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=237.04s)]
*  Elon said yes and Don Jr. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=238.76s)]
*  said yes, etc. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=239.96s)]
*  I started saying 400 billion. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=241.28s)]
*  Now we're down to 50, but okay, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=243.4s)]
*  over five years, $250 billion. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=244.84s)]
*  By the way, if they actually [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=247.0s)]
*  implemented that and we just got [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=248.2s)]
*  them as actual savings, not bad. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=249.6s)]
*  Not bad, I'd give them a lot of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=252.24s)]
*  credit for that if they actually [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=253.6s)]
*  did that, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=254.88s)]
*  So I'll take that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=255.96s)]
*  In fact, there's one other thing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=256.96s)]
*  that I like in this proposal. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=258.32s)]
*  But wait, they're not savings. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=259.68s)]
*  You're just reassigning the money [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=263.72s)]
*  within the Pentagon. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=265.68s)]
*  So that equals zero cuts. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=266.96s)]
*  So let me read more, okay? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=268.88s)]
*  And then I want to wonder about, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=270.32s)]
*  wait, which companies would get [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=272.56s)]
*  contracts for iron dome? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=274.96s)]
*  Would Starlink get some contracts? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=277.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=281.0s)]
*  Does he make missile defense [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=282.32s)]
*  systems? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=283.48s)]
*  So he's definitely a defense [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=284.04s)]
*  contractor at this point. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=285.52s)]
*  No, he is, yes, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  he's a defense contractor. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  Starlink has been used in Ukraine, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=289.24s)]
*  for instance. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=291.24s)]
*  Yeah, so to be fair, I don't know. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=292.44s)]
*  But if this turns into a $50 [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  billion a year doesn't get cut, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=296.64s)]
*  it just gets reallocated to Elon [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  Musk, the degree to which I'm out [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=300.56s)]
*  is indescribable. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=302.64s)]
*  Yeah, obviously. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=304.08s)]
*  Right, but to be fair, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=304.84s)]
*  we don't know that yet. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  We do know that this talk is not [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=306.88s)]
*  cuts, it's just not cuts. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  It's reassigning it to this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  mysterious project. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=312.67999999999995s)]
*  By the way, iron dome in America is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=314.56s)]
*  impossible. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  It would take an overwhelming [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=317.67999999999995s)]
*  amount of money. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=319.23999999999995s)]
*  The 250 billion wouldn't come [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=320.96s)]
*  close to doing it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=322.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's why that 50 billion [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=323.28s)]
*  figure jumped out at me. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=325.52s)]
*  But now that you explained it, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=327.44s)]
*  I understand what you mean, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=328.84s)]
*  or what they meant. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=330.08s)]
*  Now, William Hartung, who's a senior [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=331.23999999999995s)]
*  research fellow at the Quincy [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=333.52s)]
*  Institute for Responsible Statecraft, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=335.32s)]
*  tempered celebration about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=337.88s)]
*  the cuts, writing upon [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=339.85999999999996s)]
*  clarification, it became clear that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=341.4s)]
*  the plan is not to reduce [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  the Pentagon's top line. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=345.64s)]
*  But to shift any savings found in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=347.67999999999995s)]
*  one part of the department to pay [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  for other systems and activities [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=352.44s)]
*  more in line with the preferences [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=354.86s)]
*  of the administration. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=357.32s)]
*  This was actually something that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=359.64000000000004s)]
*  Ken Klippenstein kind of warned me [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=361.8s)]
*  about during our conversation for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=364.04s)]
*  my substack unaligned. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=366.26s)]
*  And that really did jump out at me [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=367.72s)]
*  as part of our conversation, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  because I could totally see that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=370.56s)]
*  happening. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=372.0s)]
*  Now, Hartung also described [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=373.04s)]
*  the plan as moving around funds [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=374.8s)]
*  inside the Pentagon. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  Nonetheless, the war industrial [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=378.24s)]
*  complex is absolutely shook on [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=380.96s)]
*  Wall Street stocks for [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=383.3s)]
*  Planeteer, Lockheed Martin, and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=384.86s)]
*  several other major defense [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=387.5s)]
*  contractors tumbled after the post [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=389.47999999999996s)]
*  published news about Hegs's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=392.12s)]
*  directive. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=394.41999999999996s)]
*  Now, look, Elon Musk and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=396.24s)]
*  Doge are reportedly looking to lay [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=398.14s)]
*  off thousands of civilian employees [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=400.52s)]
*  at the Pentagon. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=403.24s)]
*  So for instance, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=405.44s)]
*  one Pentagon spokesperson said that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=406.32s)]
*  Hegs's exit has directed defense [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=408.12s)]
*  officials to evaluate the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=409.92s)]
*  probationary workforce with [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=411.3s)]
*  the determination already made that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=413.0s)]
*  some civilian probationary employees [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=415.04s)]
*  will be separated from service in [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=417.16s)]
*  the near future. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  It is not in the public interest to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=420.0s)]
*  retain individuals whose [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=422.04s)]
*  contributions are not mission [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=423.64s)]
*  critical, this Pentagon spokesperson [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=425.56s)]
*  said. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=428.0s)]
*  But even if you're totally fine [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=428.56s)]
*  with those workers being fired or [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=430.8s)]
*  with reducing personnel, it's not [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=433.24s)]
*  really going to make a big enough [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=436.16s)]
*  dent in the defense budget to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=438.28s)]
*  mostly focus on that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=440.32s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=442.24s)]
*  In the context here, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=444.44s)]
*  I think there are two piece, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=445.4s)]
*  personnel at the Defense Department [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=446.52s)]
*  and procurement. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=448.04s)]
*  You know better than I do that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=449.08s)]
*  procurement is where the real money [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=450.4s)]
*  is and there are ways to find weapon [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=452.04s)]
*  systems that can be manufactured [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=453.72s)]
*  more efficiently, less costly. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=455.4s)]
*  It's been a constant story at [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=457.36s)]
*  the Pentagon. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=458.72s)]
*  That's where the real money is, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=459.44s)]
*  isn't it? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=460.92s)]
*  Well, it is and if you're going to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=462.72s)]
*  save that real money, you have to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=464.6s)]
*  make substantial cuts in like [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=466.68s)]
*  individual weapons programs such as [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=468.68s)]
*  doing away with a new aircraft, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=471.16s)]
*  a new fighter jet, a new tank. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=473.4s)]
*  You can't just nibble around [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  the edges, you have to make [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=477.68s)]
*  significant cuts in significant [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=479.12s)]
*  places. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=480.96s)]
*  And I don't think there's anybody [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=482.08s)]
*  who thinks there may not be room [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=483.96s)]
*  for that, but again, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=485.68s)]
*  those defense manufacturing jobs. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=486.92s)]
*  That's bread and butter for [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=489.36s)]
*  both Democrats and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=490.88s)]
*  Republicans on Capitol Hill. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=491.88s)]
*  That is absolutely true, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=495.24s)]
*  legal bribery from defense [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=496.68s)]
*  contractors absolutely is a bread [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=498.2s)]
*  and butter for Democrats and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=500.2s)]
*  Republicans in Congress. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=501.8s)]
*  And so, look, Doge is also [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=503.72s)]
*  targeting staff at the Department [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=505.6s)]
*  of Veterans Affairs, which really, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=508.08s)]
*  really bothers me because if [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=510.72s)]
*  anything, they should be bolstering [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=512.72s)]
*  resources for our veterans. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=515.56s)]
*  Nonetheless, a thousand, no, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=519.48s)]
*  I'm sorry, yeah, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=521.52s)]
*  a thousand federal workers have [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=522.52s)]
*  already been fired from the VA. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=524.36s)]
*  And I'm sure that's going to have [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=525.92s)]
*  an impact on our veterans and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=527.42s)]
*  the services that we're supposed [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=528.7s)]
*  to be offering them. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=530.16s)]
*  Yeah, as you'll see later in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=531.36s)]
*  the show, Jesse Waters complaining [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=532.6s)]
*  that, well, I didn't mean fire my [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=534.16s)]
*  friends who are veterans. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=535.76s)]
*  Well, that's kind of how it works, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=537.16s)]
*  sad day for you. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=538.6s)]
*  All right, so now important stuff [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=539.76s)]
*  here, first of all, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=541.24s)]
*  I now see some Democrats being to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=542.32s)]
*  fight against cuts at the Pentagon. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=543.92s)]
*  Are you surprised? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=546.2s)]
*  No, no, what are you doing? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=546.96s)]
*  It's political malpractice, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=550.44s)]
*  let alone the fact that you guys [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=552.0s)]
*  see, and what did I tell you about [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=553.64s)]
*  good cop, bad cop, uniparty, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=555.02s)]
*  establishment Democrats and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=556.4s)]
*  Republicans? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=557.76s)]
*  When push comes to shove, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=559.0s)]
*  all the Democrats who said they [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=559.92s)]
*  wanted to cut the Pentagon, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=561.0799999999999s)]
*  all of a sudden don't want to cut [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=562.4s)]
*  the Pentagon, okay? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=563.92s)]
*  So to be fair, not all the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=565.68s)]
*  Democrats, Bernie Sanders has [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=566.76s)]
*  the same exact position that we do. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  Ro Khanna has the same position as [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  we do. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=571.2399999999999s)]
*  But look, if you're a Democrat, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=572.76s)]
*  how do you fight back in a way [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=574.76s)]
*  that's effective? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=576.3599999999999s)]
*  You go, hey, I love the cuts, but [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  they've got to be actual cuts, and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=579.56s)]
*  they can't be going to other [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=581.88s)]
*  defense contractors, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  no matter who they are, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=583.96s)]
*  that makes no sense. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=584.96s)]
*  But if you do the cuts and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=586.24s)]
*  you send it to the taxpayers, or [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=587.24s)]
*  you pay off the debt, then we're in. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=588.84s)]
*  Because then you gain [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=591.64s)]
*  the moral high ground. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=592.6s)]
*  Then you're with the great majority [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=593.5600000000001s)]
*  of the American people who actually [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=595.28s)]
*  do want to cut the Pentagon, and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=597.0s)]
*  want the money to go back to them, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=598.44s)]
*  and not to another defense [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=599.96s)]
*  contractor. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=601.12s)]
*  Can you imagine if we lived in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  a world where Democratic lawmakers [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=603.28s)]
*  realized, hey, you know what? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=605.36s)]
*  This is actually something that we [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=607.2s)]
*  have alleged that we wanted to do. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=609.0s)]
*  So now that we have an executive [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=611.36s)]
*  branch that also alleges that they [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=613.0400000000001s)]
*  want to cut the Pentagon budget, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=614.9200000000001s)]
*  let's be part of the conversation [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=616.76s)]
*  rather than automatically take [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=618.5s)]
*  the opposite position. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and part of the reason they [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=621.88s)]
*  take opposite positions is because [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=623.6s)]
*  Trump bad, right? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=625.44s)]
*  But the main reason is donors good. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  100%, yes. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=628.72s)]
*  So, all right, last things are, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  at least they didn't cut [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=632.28s)]
*  service members. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  They were smart enough not to do [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=634.8000000000001s)]
*  that, so they're cutting Pentagon [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=636.24s)]
*  employees, but not the actual [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  troops. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=639.4s)]
*  So just want to be clear about [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=640.28s)]
*  that, and then lastly, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=641.88s)]
*  they're shuffling the budget around [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=643.24s)]
*  in terms of the map, and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=645.6s)]
*  where our priorities are [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=647.12s)]
*  geographically. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=648.64s)]
*  So they're putting more money into [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=650.28s)]
*  Asia, etc. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=652.28s)]
*  Look, I think the military kind of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=653.0s)]
*  reaction we have to China is absurd. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=655.56s)]
*  But okay, at least I get it, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=658.52s)]
*  they view them as a top strategic [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=660.68s)]
*  competitor, etc. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=663.0s)]
*  So where are they taking [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=664.68s)]
*  the money away from? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=666.28s)]
*  One is Europe, and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=667.8s)]
*  a lot of people are fricking [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=669.16s)]
*  lumped about that. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=670.28s)]
*  Now I get why you'd be a little [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=671.28s)]
*  upset these days given how [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  aggressive Russia is. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=674.28s)]
*  But outside of that, Europe, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=675.7199999999999s)]
*  at some point, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=677.52s)]
*  you do have to defend yourself. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=678.4s)]
*  We've carried you for [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=680.04s)]
*  a long, long time. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=681.7199999999999s)]
*  That's the thing that Trump's not [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=683.4s)]
*  wrong about, okay? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=684.76s)]
*  And then the other places they're [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=686.36s)]
*  taking money away from is [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=688.5999999999999s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=690.4399999999999s)]
*  That's great news, because the old [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  way of thinking is, we're going to [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=694.04s)]
*  put all of our money in Israel, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=696.12s)]
*  Middle East, right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=697.76s)]
*  And we got to pull all of our [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=699.24s)]
*  aircraft carriers, all of our bases, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=700.4s)]
*  and sort of to fight the Muslims, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=701.92s)]
*  I mean the terrorists. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=703.16s)]
*  Sweet, sweet, Cenk. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=704.48s)]
*  You sweet, sweet man. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=706.2s)]
*  What? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=707.8s)]
*  So you're saying they're not [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=709.88s)]
*  going to do it? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=710.64s)]
*  I would bet everything I own, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=711.2s)]
*  I would bet the shirt off my back, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=713.12s)]
*  that that ain't going to happen. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=715.24s)]
*  No, no, don't get me wrong, guys, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=717.6s)]
*  with all these things, and [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=718.92s)]
*  Ana's right to throw in that note [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=720.08s)]
*  of skepticism. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=721.52s)]
*  I'm telling you what they say [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=722.96s)]
*  they're going to do, right? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=724.08s)]
*  I'm not telling you that they're [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=725.16s)]
*  definitely going to do it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=726.2s)]
*  So when I suggested that, hey, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=727.16s)]
*  wouldn't it be great to cut [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=728.36s)]
*  the Pentagon? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=729.28s)]
*  Some people thought that that meant [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=730.0s)]
*  that I instantly believed that [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=732.04s)]
*  Trump and Elon Musk were angels, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=733.8399999999999s)]
*  and that they would cut [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=735.88s)]
*  the Pentagon. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=737.12s)]
*  And I was positive of it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=738.04s)]
*  No, what I noticed was that [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=739.7199999999999s)]
*  the voters, the MAGA voters and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=741.04s)]
*  independent voters were like, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=742.7199999999999s)]
*  hell yeah, cut the Pentagon. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=744.48s)]
*  I'm on the side of the voters, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=746.6s)]
*  not on the side of any slimy [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=748.0799999999999s)]
*  politicians. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=749.36s)]
*  So now, do I think they're actually [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=750.56s)]
*  going to cut the Middle East? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=752.4399999999999s)]
*  No, probably not, because obviously [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=754.4399999999999s)]
*  they're going to cut the Pentagon, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=756.32s)]
*  they're going to cut Harry [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=758.0s)]
*  Madoff, and AIPAC, etc. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=759.48s)]
*  But the very fact that they're [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=760.7600000000001s)]
*  verbally saying cut the Pentagon [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  and riling up their side to cut it, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=764.36s)]
*  that rhetorically is super helpful. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=766.2800000000001s)]
*  because one day you might get [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=768.44s)]
*  a real populist who then says, hey, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=769.72s)]
*  you guys said you wanted to cut [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=771.32s)]
*  the Pentagon, let's actually do it [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=772.6400000000001s)]
*  this time. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=774.2800000000001s)]
*  And then somebody who comes in and [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=774.9200000000001s)]
*  says, you said wanted to cut our [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=776.72s)]
*  troops and our presence in [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=778.4200000000001s)]
*  the Middle East, why don't we [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=779.72s)]
*  actually do it this time? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=781.2800000000001s)]
*  And that person, right-wing or [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC7dSkEHh0&t=782.6800000000001s)]
