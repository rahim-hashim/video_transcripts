I hold the line 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 

Try me."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Nancy Mace Posts UNHINGED Confrontation With Constituent
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0)
*  I do them every year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=0.0s)]
*  You want to keep going? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1.84s)]
*  Do you want to keep going and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=3.04s)]
*  keep harassing me? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=4.44s)]
*  You could have gone to a dozen [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  town halls last year. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=7.04s)]
*  Yeah, I've already done one. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=8.36s)]
*  I'll do plenty more. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=12.72s)]
*  You're always invited. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=14.96s)]
*  Get out of my face. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=16.0s)]
*  Goodbye. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=18.68s)]
*  You're insane. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=19.68s)]
*  F*** you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=20.68s)]
*  Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mase [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=23.68s)]
*  posted that video online. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=26.68s)]
*  She's the one who posted it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=29.36s)]
*  And what you see there is a man who [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=31.28s)]
*  approached her apparently to ask [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=33.56s)]
*  whether she was going to hold any [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=35.96s)]
*  town halls. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  She must have been offended by [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  that question because her reaction [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=40.84s)]
*  to it wasn't great. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=42.4s)]
*  And there's actually a lot more [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  from where that came from. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=45.44s)]
*  So Cenk. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a constituent [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=48.48s)]
*  asking, hey, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=50.48s)]
*  are you going to do a town hall? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=51.48s)]
*  Her first answer is I did one last [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  year, curious answer. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, last year when you were not [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  in power, they would like you to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=58.36s)]
*  answer what you're going to do now [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  that the Republicans are in power. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=61.56s)]
*  And of course you want to avoid [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=65.96s)]
*  Okay, I can understand that, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  although she did it very [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=68.28s)]
*  inartfully. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=69.56s)]
*  But why post it and then why get [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  into his sexuality? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  because that's what's coming up [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=74.64s)]
*  next because she's cuckoo for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=76.24s)]
*  the post. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=77.8s)]
*  All right, so let's watch. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  By the way, I voted for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=81.56s)]
*  gay marriage twice. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=83.0s)]
*  So I'm just saying it has to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=84.64s)]
*  everything to do with you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  You think everything about me has [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=87.8s)]
*  to do with gay marriage? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=89.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Yep, absolutely. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=91.12s)]
*  If you want to get in my face about [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=93.72s)]
*  town halls, you should have shown [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=95.24s)]
*  up to one last year. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=96.88s)]
*  You can talk about me just saying [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=97.96s)]
*  I support gay marriage. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=99.52s)]
*  Yeah, because you're getting in my [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=100.8s)]
*  face about a town hall you could [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=102.24s)]
*  have gone last year. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=103.6s)]
*  Question from right over here is if [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  you have any plans to have more [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=106.16s)]
*  towns all this year. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=107.8s)]
*  I have town halls every year. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  I have over a dozen every year. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=109.92s)]
*  Great, that was my entire question. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=111.16s)]
*  You didn't have to get into this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=112.48s)]
*  You should be a little bit. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=113.4s)]
*  You could have come to any of them [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=114.48s)]
*  last year. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=116.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=116.76s)]
*  I had over a dozen. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=117.28s)]
*  You're not 2024. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=118.32s)]
*  Listen, I get that he's holding [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=121.96s)]
*  a bottle of La Roche-Posay facial [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  cleanser and I get that he's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=126.2s)]
*  wearing short shorts. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  But man, that was risky to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=129.44s)]
*  automatically assume that that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=131.0s)]
*  guy's gay. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=132.92s)]
*  My husband likes to wear short [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=134.76s)]
*  shorts, he's not gay, trust me. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, that was nuts. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=138.27999999999997s)]
*  That was nuts. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  Like, wait, how do we get on [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=140.72s)]
*  the gay marriage? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=142.48s)]
*  And what does that have to do with [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  town halls about tariffs? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=145.72s)]
*  And the other things that we're [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  concerned about and due process. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=149.04s)]
*  And you know why? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  Because guys, don't forget this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=152.27999999999997s)]
*  So we get frustrated sometimes when [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=153.6s)]
*  Democrats play identity politics, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=155.16s)]
*  right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=156.76s)]
*  But Republicans started identity [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=157.27999999999997s)]
*  politics. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=159.27999999999997s)]
*  So what was the Southern strategy? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=160.27999999999997s)]
*  That was, hey, vote for us in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  the South because we're against [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=163.64s)]
*  civil rights for African Americans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=165.2s)]
*  If that ain't identity politics, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=167.24s)]
*  I don't know what is. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=168.72s)]
*  So now, and from time to time, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=169.84s)]
*  they'll do other things that are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=171.4s)]
*  involved in identity politics and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  we call it out, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=174.68s)]
*  But we're fair, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=175.84s)]
*  we call out both sides on it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=176.56s)]
*  And in this case, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  that was identity politics on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  steroids for no reason at all. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  For no reason. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=182.48000000000002s)]

*  it to even a different level. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=408.96s)]
*  Because she writes then, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=411.04s)]
*  being a public official doesn't [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=412.40000000000003s)]

*  it again. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=584.6s)]

*  The day where, okay, so basically [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=630.12s)]
*  the reason why I was feeling that [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=631.72s)]
*  was because I had to give myself [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=633.28s)]
*  these injections, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=634.88s)]

*  your bone marrow to overproduce [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=639.12s)]

*  cells into your bloodstream. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=642.6s)]
*  And then when you go in to donate [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=644.64s)]
*  your stem cells, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=646.56s)]
*  it's this whole process that you go [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=647.52s)]
*  through where they take the blood [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=649.56s)]
*  out of your body, spin it, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  take the stem cells out and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=653.0s)]
*  then put the rest of the blood back [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=654.4399999999999s)]
*  into your body, okay? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=656.36s)]
*  So it's just like you could, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=659.56s)]
*  I don't know, maybe you could [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  feel it, maybe it wasn't what I was [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=663.24s)]
*  actually feeling, but you can [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=665.28s)]
*  almost feel your bone marrow [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=667.04s)]
*  pushing the stem cells into [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=668.64s)]
*  your bloodstream. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=670.16s)]
*  It's a crazy feeling. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=671.36s)]
*  And then one of my biggest fears [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=672.4s)]
*  was that I would have to go in for [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=674.08s)]
*  a second day to do the donation [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=675.92s)]
*  process, and my fears were coming [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=677.76s)]
*  to fruition. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=679.76s)]
*  So I go in to do the donation [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=680.72s)]
*  process, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=682.08s)]
*  First thing they do is they insert [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=682.8s)]
*  two catheters in each arm. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=684.6800000000001s)]
*  I was terrified of the catheter [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=686.32s)]
*  thing, and so as I'm laying there [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=688.64s)]
*  and they're doing it, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=691.04s)]
*  sobbing, crying, I'm freaking out, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=692.64s)]
*  it wasn't painful. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=695.0s)]
*  I didn't feel anything, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  they put a numbing agent in before [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=697.28s)]
*  they insert the catheter, so [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=698.76s)]
*  that wasn't that big of a deal. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=700.12s)]
*  But then I go in and the nurse who [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=701.68s)]
*  was taking care of me as I was [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=703.92s)]
*  donating was like, you're too small. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=705.96s)]
*  And I'm like, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=709.56s)]
*  this too small thing keeps coming [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=710.16s)]
*  up, what does that mean? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=711.72s)]
*  She's like, I don't know if we're [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=712.84s)]
*  going to be able to get enough stem [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=714.08s)]
*  cells from you in one session, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=715.36s)]
*  you're going to have to come back [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=716.56s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=717.84s)]
*  And finally, I put my foot down, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=718.4s)]
*  I'm like, no, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=719.68s)]
*  I'm not going to come back tomorrow. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=720.36s)]
*  You're going to keep me here as [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=722.0s)]
*  long as you need me, and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=723.44s)]
*  I'm not going to come back tomorrow. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=724.6s)]
*  So you're going to get all [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=726.36s)]
*  the stem cells today, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=727.44s)]
*  I'm not coming tomorrow. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=728.4000000000001s)]
*  And so what was supposed to be a [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=730.24s)]
*  four hour session ended up being [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=732.1600000000001s)]
*  a seven hour session. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=734.0400000000001s)]
*  And I don't regret that because I [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=735.84s)]
*  wanted it to be over. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=737.6s)]
*  And finally it was over, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=739.32s)]
*  the next day they actually [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=740.84s)]
*  transplanted the stem cells for [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=742.48s)]
*  my mom. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=744.48s)]
*  And we don't know yet if it's going [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=745.2800000000001s)]
*  to be effective, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=747.24s)]
*  if it's going to work. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=748.12s)]
*  We're going to have to wait and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  see but she'll be in the hospital [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=751.12s)]
*  for the next month. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  And then hopefully it does work and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=754.0s)]
*  that she recovers and [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=755.84s)]
*  is able to live a longer life. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=757.08s)]
*  But a dollar for [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  every time somebody says, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=760.36s)]
*  Cenk, you're too small. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=761.48s)]
*  I'd have $0. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=764.2s)]
*  Small relative to my mom, right? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=766.12s)]
*  Because obviously if she's bigger [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=768.12s)]
*  than me, then she's going to need [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=769.88s)]
*  more of my stem cells in order to. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=771.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=773.0400000000001s)]
*  So saving a life is a hell of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  a thing. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=776.48s)]
*  So I don't know, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=777.84s)]
*  it's not my place but it is. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=780.08s)]
*  Thank you for doing it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=783.12s)]
*  Thanks Cenk. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=784.88s)]
*  Yeah, and so I, it speaks incredibly [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=785.5200000000001s)]
*  well of you and we're obviously all [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  rooting for your mom. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=793.5600000000001s)]
*  And so there's great things and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  questionable things at all [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=799.5200000000001s)]
*  about religious texts, right? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=802.32s)]
*  But one of my favorite things in [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=806.0400000000001s)]
*  the Quran is when Muhammad says, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=808.32s)]
*  if you save one man, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=810.84s)]
*  you save the world. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=812.36s)]
*  And so if we all had that attitude [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=814.4000000000001s)]
*  would be a lot better world, right? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=816.24s)]
*  And so I appreciate you trying to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=818.6800000000001s)]
*  save one person. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=820.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm sure mom, of course, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=821.88s)]
*  I get it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=823.08s)]
*  Yeah, of course, yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  But still, still, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=824.2s)]
*  that's how we save the world. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=825.4000000000001s)]
*  And guys, there's like a nationwide [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=828.24s)]
*  blood shortage and patients who [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=830.6400000000001s)]
*  need blood transfusions. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  Basically hospitals are kind of [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=834.32s)]
*  holding back. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=836.12s)]
*  Let's say a patient needs two bags [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=837.3199999999999s)]
*  of blood during a blood [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  transfusion. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=840.4s)]
*  They'll start off with just giving [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=841.36s)]
*  that patient one because of that [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=843.0s)]
*  severe shortage. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=844.6s)]
*  So you don't have to be a stem cell [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=845.56s)]
*  donor, but if you can, please [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=847.3199999999999s)]
*  consider being a blood donor. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=849.04s)]
*  Hit up the American Red Cross, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=851.6s)]
*  be like, yo, I heard you guys are [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=853.3199999999999s)]
*  dealing with a severe shortage. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=855.0s)]
*  I'd like to help, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=856.8399999999999s)]
*  I'd like to donate blood. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  And you really have to start [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=858.72s)]
*  the conversation with yo. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=859.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=861.16s)]
*  Otherwise the Red Cross won't even [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=861.8s)]
*  pick it up. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=863.12s)]
*  That's when they know you mean [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=863.76s)]
*  business. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=865.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=865.6s)]
*  So I'm glad you reminded me of [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=866.36s)]
*  that because I used to give blood [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=867.84s)]
*  all the time when I was younger. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=869.68s)]
*  And so I was proud of that and [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=875.0s)]
*  I liked being able to help in that [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=876.76s)]
*  way and I haven't done it in [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=878.84s)]
*  a long time. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=880.4s)]
*  So I should go back and [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=881.5600000000001s)]
*  do that too. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=882.8s)]
*  So maybe I'll call up the Red Cross [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=883.8s)]
*  and go yo. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=885.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=886.2s)]
*  Yo, I'm going to go back to giving [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=887.2s)]
*  blood. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=888.24s)]
*  And they'll appreciate it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=888.76s)]
*  Yeah, so now that's a wonderful [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=890.28s)]
*  thing that you did. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=892.24s)]
*  So and you came back right away, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=893.44s)]
*  which is amazing. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=896.2s)]
*  So it's wonderful to have you [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=898.9200000000001s)]
*  back. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=900.6800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=901.2s)]
*  So at the risk of modeling these [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=902.72s)]
*  things, I said you saved one life [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=905.5200000000001s)]
*  and saved the world, etc. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=908.7600000000001s)]
*  And it reminded me of the story [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=911.2800000000001s)]
*  from over the weekend. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=912.6800000000001s)]
*  So I did a live on it, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=913.96s)]
*  I did a short on it and stuff. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=915.08s)]
*  So we didn't get to do it today [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=916.8000000000001s)]
*  because I already did it basically [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  over the weekend. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=920.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm sure that you guys saw it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  So it's the story of Fatima Hasuna, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=923.64s)]
*  25 year old photo journalist in [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=926.88s)]
*  Palestine in Gaza. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=929.9599999999999s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=932.12s)]
*  You just reminded me of something, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=933.8s)]
*  finish your story, but [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=934.92s)]
*  I'll tell you afterwards. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=935.8s)]
*  Yeah, so they made a movie about [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=937.0799999999999s)]
*  her and it got into the Cannes Film [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=939.3199999999999s)]
*  Festival. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=941.68s)]
*  And so that was great news and [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=942.8399999999999s)]
*  there was something she's going to [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=944.16s)]
*  get married in a couple of days. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=945.4399999999999s)]
*  The IDF dropped a bomb on her [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=947.4s)]
*  house within 24 hours of the news [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=949.04s)]
*  that it got accepted into Cannes. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=951.12s)]
*  They killed her and [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=954.2s)]
*  ten family members, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  including her pregnant sister. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=956.9200000000001s)]
*  So there won't be a wedding, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=959.76s)]
*  obviously she's dead. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=960.76s)]
*  And so IDF, Jesus Christ, man. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=962.76s)]
*  So the reason why I got reminded of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=968.96s)]
*  that from Anna's story is, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=971.12s)]
*  that's why we try so hard. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=972.84s)]
*  And so some people said we did too [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=974.44s)]
*  many stories about Palestine, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=976.6800000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=978.8000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to keep doing them. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=979.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because I mean, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=980.76s)]
*  if we just say, the day we get [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=982.4399999999999s)]
*  Israel to stop bombing is the day [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=984.76s)]
*  that we save 30 lives a day, right? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=987.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're just, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=991.4s)]
*  we can't do a story every single [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=992.8s)]
*  day, but they keep bombing every [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=994.5999999999999s)]
*  day, 30 people here, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=996.52s)]
*  50 people there, etc. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=997.8399999999999s)]
*  And then same excuse every time, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=999.9599999999999s)]
*  Hamas made us do it, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1002.0799999999999s)]
*  Human Shields, October 7th. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1003.3199999999999s)]
*  Of which year, brother, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1005.8399999999999s)]
*  which year are we talking about? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1006.88s)]
*  Two years ago, meanwhile, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1008.48s)]
*  you're occupying 50% of Gaza, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1010.0400000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1011.84s)]
*  Just like we said that you would, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1012.44s)]
*  right? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1014.1600000000001s)]
*  So anyways, I know that there isn't [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1014.6800000000001s)]
*  much we could do about it, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1017.0s)]
*  you and I right here on this show. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1018.5600000000001s)]
*  But we're trying. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1021.48s)]
*  And so for all of you guys who try, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1022.4000000000001s)]
*  whether it's that or any other [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1024.48s)]
*  issue, I appreciate all you guys. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1026.44s)]
*  And we got to do it together, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1029.24s)]
*  otherwise it won't work. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1030.48s)]
*  And yeah, by the way, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1032.04s)]
*  we have to build alliances, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1032.88s)]
*  otherwise it won't work. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1034.16s)]
*  And now, lots of the, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1035.3200000000002s)]
*  Trump voters are starting to turn [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1037.04s)]
*  on this. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1039.8s)]
*  And when I first said it was going [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1040.48s)]
*  to happen, it was a super bold [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1042.44s)]
*  thing to say, right? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1044.1599999999999s)]
*  But now tons of the Brogue shows [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1045.36s)]
*  are and a lot of them are going, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1047.48s)]
*  what are we doing here? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1049.56s)]
*  And that Douglas Murray, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1051.08s)]
*  Dave Smith debate on Joe Rogan. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1052.56s)]
*  Have you been there? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1054.56s)]
*  But have you been there? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1056.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1058.48s)]
*  So look, real quick on that, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1059.28s)]
*  because we're running out of time. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1061.12s)]
*  But so, I'm going to say, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1063.36s)]
*  so I think that was a turning [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1066.24s)]
*  point. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  I think, so what happened was Sam [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1069.3999999999999s)]
*  Harrison Douglas Murray both went [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1071.28s)]
*  out at the same time and said, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1073.2s)]
*  Joe Rogan should not have these [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1074.74s)]
*  people on, okay? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1076.3999999999999s)]
*  And these Israeli critics are not [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1077.9199999999998s)]
*  experts, and you need authority [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1080.04s)]
*  figures who are all absolute [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1082.08s)]
*  supporters of Israel, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1083.6799999999998s)]
*  we're the only authority figures. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1085.04s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1087.12s)]
*  And so now look, there's some folks [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1087.9199999999998s)]
*  that have gone on those shows that [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1089.52s)]
*  have gone way too far, because [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1091.0s)]
*  they're not talking about Israel, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1092.3999999999999s)]
*  and they start talking about World [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1094.12s)]
*  War II revisionism, don't do that. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1095.6799999999998s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1097.28s)]
*  Yeah, seriously. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1097.8s)]
*  Like that doesn't help at all, and [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1098.32s)]
*  it's not true, and [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1099.84s)]
*  it's not right, right? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1100.56s)]
*  But at the same time, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1101.84s)]
*  they are questioning Israel. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1102.84s)]
*  And so that's what Douglas Murray [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1105.0s)]
*  is actually pissed about. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1106.56s)]
*  So I remember when I had a debate [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1107.8799999999999s)]
*  with him on Piers Morgan about [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1109.4399999999998s)]
*  a year ago, or I lost track now, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1110.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean the war's been going, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1112.76s)]
*  war of defense has been going on [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1114.56s)]
*  for year after year now. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1116.4799999999998s)]
*  So, and Douglas Murray's main thing [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1118.9599999999998s)]

*  He got nothing left, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1215.08s)]
*  they got nothing left. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1216.1599999999999s)]
*  because it's a slaughterhouse, and [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1217.76s)]
*  we all see that it's a slaughterhouse, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1219.3999999999999s)]

*  It's bad. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1221.56s)]
*  So anyways, that was, I think we [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1222.08s)]
*  will look back on that as a seminal [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1224.84s)]
*  moment, because what happened was [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1227.6s)]
*  the right wing then got mad at that [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1230.3999999999999s)]
*  cancel culture of him and [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1232.84s)]

*  That's why I've been telling you [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1237.4399999999998s)]
*  Dave Smith is a pivotal character [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1238.6399999999999s)]
*  in this, right? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1240.04s)]
*  And so when Douglas Murray tried [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1241.24s)]
*  to cancel him while they're on [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1243.1599999999999s)]
*  the air together, saying he [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1244.8s)]

*  Douglas fucking Murray, which by [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1250.36s)]
*  the way, I then looked it up. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1252.28s)]
*  The brother doesn't have any degree [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1254.0s)]
*  on this, he has no expertise at all. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1255.84s)]
*  But he's been there. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1258.2s)]
*  But he's been there. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1260.24s)]
*  By the way, if that's true, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1261.76s)]
*  that makes every Palestinian 10,000 [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1263.32s)]
*  that times the expert Douglas [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1265.48s)]

*  doing this the whole time, Douglas. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1268.84s)]

*  he started making fun of Douglas [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1273.0s)]
*  Murray. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1275.24s)]

*  I don't agree with him on [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1278.72s)]

*  I think he's honest about what he [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1281.48s)]

*  a young Palestinian man. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1322.76s)]

*  I felt, I don't know, maybe it's not [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1326.32s)]

*  the time for safety. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1346.24s)]
*  And the Palestinians welcomed them [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1348.28s)]
*  and protected them and everything. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1350.36s)]
*  My maternal grandmother, for [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1352.36s)]

*  And now my tax dollars go toward [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1355.32s)]
*  their extermination in Gaza and [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1358.04s)]
*  the West Bank, and [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1360.84s)]
*  I've been feeling guilt about that. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1362.24s)]
*  And then I find out my mom's [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1364.3999999999999s)]
*  doctor is going to be a Palestinian [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1365.76s)]
*  guide, he might save my mom's life. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1367.3999999999999s)]
*  And then I just, I don't know, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1369.36s)]
*  I just continued feeling like this [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1370.8799999999999s)]
*  shame because I wish I had some [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1372.6s)]
*  power to change the way our [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1374.28s)]
*  government is supporting what [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1375.84s)]
*  the Israeli government is doing to [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1377.6s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1379.52s)]
*  But then I got to meet this doctor [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1380.84s)]
*  for the first time. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1383.24s)]
*  And I think it might have been [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1385.1599999999999s)]
*  my proudest moment. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1387.12s)]
*  He sat down with me and [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1388.8s)]
*  my brother and explained everything, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1389.96s)]
*  really took his time with us, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1392.04s)]
*  which I appreciate. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1393.6s)]
*  And then in the very end, he said [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1394.84s)]
*  that he's a huge fan of the show. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1396.96s)]
*  And then I was like, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1399.72s)]
*  are you Palestinian? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1400.6s)]
*  I knew already, but he's like, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1401.6s)]
*  yeah, he's like, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1403.12s)]
*  that's how I found you, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1403.96s)]
*  that's why I'm a fan of the show. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1405.1999999999998s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1407.1599999999999s)]
*  And that made me feel way better. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1407.96s)]
*  Not that I matter, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1409.56s)]
*  my feelings matter that much, but [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1410.3999999999999s)]
*  at least some of that shame went [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1412.28s)]
*  away. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1414.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'll say one last thing now. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1415.36s)]
*  So I had the rules of the internet [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1418.32s)]
*  that I came up with and I said, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1423.36s)]
*  we fight on things we disagree on. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1427.0s)]
*  And then we have a beer and then, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1430.4399999999998s)]
*  but if we agree, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1432.4399999999998s)]
*  we should work together, right? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1433.48s)]
*  So the number one issue that folks, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1435.6799999999998s)]
*  some folks on the left had was [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1438.08s)]
*  having a beer part, right? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1440.04s)]
*  And they're like, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1442.32s)]
*  you want to have a beer with this [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1443.36s)]
*  guy, you want to have a beer with [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1444.76s)]
*  this guy, right? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1446.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to have a beer with [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1448.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan, because he might help [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1449.48s)]
*  save Palestinian lives. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1451.2s)]
*  And if you're so selfish and [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1452.8799999999999s)]
*  emotional that you don't want to [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1454.6s)]
*  have a beer with Joe Rogan, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1456.6s)]
*  even though he might help [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1458.1599999999999s)]
*  Palestinians, that's on you, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1459.56s)]
*  brothers and sisters. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1461.4399999999998s)]
*  And so don't ever talk to me about [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1463.36s)]
*  vulnerable communities. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1465.04s)]
*  If you're not willing to hurt your [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1466.28s)]
*  brand, to go talk to other people [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1468.8s)]
*  that are in independence or [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1471.68s)]
*  right wingers or whoever they are, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1473.48s)]
*  that could help build an alliance [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1475.92s)]
*  to protect Palestinian lives. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1478.04s)]
*  And your brand is more important [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1480.32s)]
*  than saving Palestinian lives. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1482.04s)]
*  Don't talk to me about [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1483.96s)]
*  vulnerable communities. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1484.68s)]
*  I'm not interested in hearing that, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1485.52s)]
*  okay? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1487.56s)]
*  So yeah, I'll do it again and [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1488.28s)]
*  again and again, and I will build [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1490.16s)]
*  alliances for peace and against war [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1492.56s)]
*  and against the occupation of this [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1495.28s)]
*  country by Israel. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1497.92s)]
*  And if you don't want that and [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1499.56s)]
*  you say, no, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1501.12s)]
*  I'm going to hold it against you, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1501.92s)]
*  great, no problem. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1503.68s)]
*  Hold it against me, brothers and [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1504.76s)]
*  sisters, no problem at all. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1506.2s)]
*  But I'm going to do what's right [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1507.4s)]
*  and not what is convenient [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1508.96s)]
*  at the time. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1510.56s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1511.68s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1513.36s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1514.8s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1515.8799999999999s)]
*  our live shows. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuVq4gK4_K0&t=1517.12s)]
