The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump's Labor Sec Nominee Makes MAJOR Flip-Flop
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ)
*  I know you're aware of this, but about half the country has right to work laws, 26 states have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  them. The Pro Act wasn't just about organizing or enabling unions to organize, which they already [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=4.72s)]
*  have the right to do. The Pro Act was about overturning right to work laws in 26 states, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  half of the country. Do you still support the Pro Act or don't you support the Pro Act? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=16.56s)]
*  Yesterday, Laurie Chavez de Raemer, President Donald Trump's nominee for Labor Secretary, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=22.8s)]
*  had some difficult questions, basically lodged in her direction about her position on the Pro Act. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=30.08s)]
*  Now, in the past, Chavez de Raemer has been in favor of the Pro Act. She was one of the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=39.2s)]
*  only Republicans that promoted it, that co-signed legislation in Congress to try to get it passed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=44.56s)]
*  And it's supposed to help bolster the rights of workers in order to make it easier for them to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  organize in their workplace to unionize if they want to. But some are accusing her of basically [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=56.96s)]
*  selling out after she walked back part of her support for one specific part of the Pro Act [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=62.88s)]
*  as you're about to see. Thank you, Senator Paul, and I appreciated our meeting as well. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=69.36s)]
*  I thought it was quite, what you shared with me is how important it is to you and your state. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=75.2s)]
*  And I heard that from many members. The right to work is a fundamental tenet of labor laws, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=85.36s)]
*  where states have a right to choose if they want to be a right to work state and that should be [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=91.44s)]
*  protected. Pro Act will return that. Yes, thank you, Senator. I signed on to the Pro Act because I [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=95.36s)]
*  was representing Oregon's 5th District, but I also signed on to the Pro Act because I wanted to be [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=101.52s)]
*  at that table and have those conversations. But I fully, fairly and support states who want to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=107.76s)]
*  protect their right to work. I have said that to every senator that I have visited. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=112.24s)]
*  So you no longer support the aspect of the Pro Act that would have overturned state right to work [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=116.24s)]
*  laws? Yeah, there were so many parts- That's a yes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Yes. All right, so let's just take a quick moment to break down what right to work laws mean for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  anyone who's unfamiliar because it does have a super dishonest name, okay? It's not about [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=131.76s)]
*  right to work. It's really about disempowering labor unions. So if you live in a right to work [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=137.44s)]
*  state, it basically means that you cannot be forced to join a union and pay union dues as [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=143.76s)]
*  a condition of employment. And that is a problem because what ends up happening is it strips [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=150.96s)]
*  unions of the resources they need in order to fight labor battles and things like that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=157.2s)]
*  But they still have to offer the same protections and the same benefits to non-dues paying workers [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=163.92s)]
*  that are part of a unionized company or workforce. And you are also allowed to work in a unionized [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  workforce without economically supporting the union, okay? So it was a way to really strip unions [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  of their resources because a lot of people don't wanna pay their dues. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=185.44s)]
*  Now, critics of right to work laws argue that both situations are already protected by law thanks to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=189.44000000000003s)]
*  both federal law and Supreme Court precedent. And that's not all. So-called right to work [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  legislation goes one step further and entitles employees to the benefits of a union contract, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  including the right to have the union take up their grievance if their employer abuses them [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=208.88000000000002s)]
*  without paying any of the cost. Now, Senator Rand Paul, who you just heard ask Chavez de [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=214.32s)]
*  Raymer about right to work in the cold open, is a massive supporter of right to work laws, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  obviously. I mean, he identifies as a libertarian. He doesn't believe in workers' rights. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  Companies should be free to abuse workers as much as they want. Yes, that is a straw man, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=231.2s)]
*  but honestly, come on, let's keep it real. He just doesn't want regulations protecting workers, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=235.28s)]
*  and that's a problem. And I'm curious what you think about how Chavez de Raymer handled that, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=239.6s)]
*  especially given her pro-labor past and the fact that she was endorsed [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=244.72s)]
*  by the head of the Teamsters Union. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=249.44s)]
*  Yeah, look, I'm hoping she's lying. And do I know? I do not know. I don't know what her real position [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=251.04s)]
*  is. Ponder in politics asked on Super Chat, while we're live in the show here, are you concerned [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=258.8s)]
*  she's compromising her pro-worker positions to get the confirmation? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=266.56s)]
*  Well, if she's compromising them and she was lying to us originally, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=270.24s)]
*  I don't mean Young Turks, I mean the voters about her position, then that sucks and I'm against it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=275.04s)]
*  If it turns out she's lying to the senators, that's Tuesday and I'm totally fine with it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=281.68s)]
*  So I mean, you can't get confirmed without lying. That's just a fact. Because the Uniparty will [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=287.2s)]
*  come in and be like, do you promise to serve only donors? They ask it in roundabout ways. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=293.28s)]
*  In this case, what do you mean donors? The companies that hire these people are all [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  donors to those senators. So anyway, I hope she's lying to them, but I don't know what's in her [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=304.23999999999995s)]
*  heart. And if they make a compromise but pass the majority of the Pro Act, that'd be a lot better [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  than not passing any of it. That's another nuance here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=316.08s)]
*  It seems that Republicans understand that the nominees of Republican presidents are going to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=318.96s)]
*  tell senators everything they want to hear to get confirmed. Whereas the left immediately pounces [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  and piles on. It's the Trump administration. She's the best option for labor in the Trump [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=332.08s)]
*  administration, given her past and her history and her support for labor rights. So we'll see. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, again, I think Sean O'Brien from the team's is at a great job in getting her in that position. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=343.67999999999995s)]
*  But is she even gonna get confirmed? I don't know, because since she is at least somewhat pro labor, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=348.08s)]
*  that's the thing that's gonna really make the donors unhappy. So she might be a rare person [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=353.52s)]
*  that's in trouble. And not because she's crazy like Cash Patel, but because of the exact opposite [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  reason. Because she actually represents the average worker in America. So look, I'll take half a win [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=363.44s)]
*  in that position over no win at all, which is the normal labor secretaries for Republicans. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  So let's see what she can do and see if she gets in. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aas_HeNPrqQ&t=376.0s)]
