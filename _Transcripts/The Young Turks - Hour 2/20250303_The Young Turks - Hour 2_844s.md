TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Elon Musk Tells Rogan Social Security Is A "Ponzi Scheme"
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4)
*  the biggest Ponzi scheme of all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=0.0s)]
*  time. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  Well, I explained that. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=3.72s)]
*  Wow, the richest man in the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=6.86s)]
*  universe thinks that social [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=8.42s)]
*  security is bad and is manufacturing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=9.94s)]
*  consent for its dismantling while [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=12.0s)]
*  appearing on Rogan. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=13.92s)]
*  I'm sure none of this was [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=15.24s)]
*  orchestrated in any way, shape, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=16.42s)]
*  or form. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=17.96s)]
*  But there you have Elon Musk, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=18.72s)]
*  again, richest man in the world, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  arguing that social security is [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=22.28s)]
*  a Ponzi scheme, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=24.14s)]
*  some evil social program that has [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=25.04s)]
*  kept tens of millions of elderly [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=27.12s)]
*  people off the streets. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=29.48s)]
*  Let's hear a little more of what he [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=32.84s)]
*  has to say, Cenk, and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=33.88s)]
*  then I want to get your thoughts. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=34.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=35.72s)]
*  If you look at the future [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  obligations of social security, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=37.84s)]
*  it far exceeds the tax revenue. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=39.84s)]
*  Far, have you ever looked at [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=43.92s)]
*  the debt clock? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=48.08s)]
*  Okay, there's our present day debt [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=48.84s)]
*  but then there's our future [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=51.24s)]
*  obligations. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=52.96s)]
*  So when you look at the future [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  obligations of social security, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=56.0s)]
*  the actual national debt is like [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=58.44s)]
*  double what people think it is [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=61.36s)]
*  because of the future obligations. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=64.28s)]
*  So basically people are living way [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=68.44s)]
*  longer than expected. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=70.72s)]
*  And there are fewer babies [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=73.52s)]
*  being born, so you have more [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=76.52s)]
*  people who are retired and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=77.68s)]
*  get that live for a long time and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=79.44s)]
*  get retirement payments. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=82.12s)]
*  So the future obligation, so [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=83.84s)]
*  however bad the financial situation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=85.44s)]
*  is right now for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=87.44s)]
*  the federal government, it'll be [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=88.36s)]
*  much worse in the future. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=90.36s)]
*  Now we don't have the money for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=92.8s)]
*  social security or the social [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=94.48s)]
*  safety net programs in the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=96.24s)]
*  So we've got to cut it, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=98.64s)]
*  we've got to gut it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  But don't worry, we do have [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=100.84s)]
*  $100 billion to invest in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=102.8s)]
*  cryptocurrency as part of the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=104.68s)]
*  American crypto reserves, which was [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=106.68s)]
*  just announced by the Trump [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=109.2s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=110.92s)]
*  We'll get to that story later, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=112.08s)]
*  Cenk. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=113.52s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm going to rip into them [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=114.12s)]
*  on policy in a second. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=116.16s)]
*  Apparently he's a child and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=117.96s)]
*  doesn't know a single thing about [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=119.56s)]
*  policy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=121.4s)]
*  But- No, he knows, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=122.92s)]
*  he just wants to dismantle it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=123.6s)]
*  No, or he thinks that Joe Rogan's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  listeners are morons. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=126.8s)]
*  And so I'll just talk down to them. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=128.56s)]
*  So we'll get to that in a second. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=130.28s)]
*  But on the politics of it, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  how is this going to end? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=133.4s)]
*  This is how it's going to end, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=134.96s)]
*  F around and find out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=136.56s)]
*  So and you're not going to find out [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=138.72s)]
*  for me, you're going to find out [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=139.92s)]
*  from the American people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  And if you're MAGA, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=142.44s)]
*  you could do the same thing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=143.4s)]
*  the Democrats did. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=144.6s)]
*  No way, Joe Biden's young and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=146.32s)]
*  dynamic because we all think he's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=147.68s)]
*  young and dynamic. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Sure, how about it? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=150.96s)]
*  See how it turns out for you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=151.96s)]
*  In this case, you're saying no, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=153.32s)]
*  we can mess around with Social [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=155.2s)]
*  Security and not find out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=156.84s)]
*  I think you will find out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=159.56s)]
*  I think the American people are [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=161.28s)]
*  going to despise you when you mess [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=162.48s)]
*  around with this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=163.68s)]
*  So let's tell you how they're [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  messing around with it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=165.84s)]
*  So first, let me address what Musk [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=167.32s)]
*  said because there is some truth to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=169.4s)]
*  what he said and it needs to be [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=171.44s)]
*  addressed in order to make [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=173.32s)]
*  our argument, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=174.76s)]
*  So he talks about the solvency of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=175.68s)]
*  the Social Security Trust Fund and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=178.0s)]
*  there is legitimate concern there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=180.4s)]
*  For instance, as the New York Times [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=183.24s)]
*  reported, the trust fund that pays [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=185.48s)]
*  Social Security's retiree benefits [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=187.72s)]
*  is expected to run dry in 2033. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=190.2s)]
*  When tax revenue will be enough to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=192.64s)]
*  pay 79% of scheduled benefits. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=195.28s)]
*  That means beneficiaries checks [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  would be reduced by 21% if [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=201.08s)]
*  Congress does not intervene. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=203.2s)]
*  Now Congress could intervene. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=204.88s)]
*  The argument that we need to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=206.68s)]
*  dismantle Social Security over this [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=208.08s)]
*  is ridiculous when in reality we [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=209.92s)]
*  could adequately fund Social [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=211.52s)]
*  Security by lifting the tax cap on [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=213.04s)]
*  Social Security taxes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=215.16s)]
*  So right now, this year, Americans [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=216.8s)]

*  in their income. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=224.28s)]
*  Any money that they earn after [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=225.68s)]
*  that, they don't get taxed for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=227.52s)]
*  Social Security. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=229.6s)]
*  You could lift that threshold, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=231.72s)]
*  because by the way, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=233.76s)]
*  it is a little ridiculous that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=234.76s)]
*  someone like Elon Musk pays the same [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=236.48s)]
*  amount in taxes for Social Security [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=238.68s)]
*  as someone who's making $176,100. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=241.0s)]
*  Isn't that a little crazy? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=243.48s)]
*  So you could lift the Social [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=247.72s)]
*  Security cap, but we're not having [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=249.0s)]
*  that discussion, are we? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=250.84s)]
*  Okay, so look, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=252.36s)]
*  I'm going to jump in on that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=253.36s)]
*  So this child comes in, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=255.24s)]
*  goes, there's a few jobs, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=256.68s)]
*  I guess, as long as you got it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=258.44s)]
*  Yeah, Elon, we all know that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=261.4s)]
*  Like a child knows that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=262.84s)]
*  Yeah, we pay now, and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=264.52s)]
*  then we get it back when we retire. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=265.76s)]
*  We understand that if there are [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=268.32s)]
*  more older people, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=269.88s)]
*  that's going to create some sort of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=270.84s)]
*  deficit, and we need to address [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=272.32s)]
*  that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=273.79999999999995s)]
*  So that's not the question. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=274.4s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=276.28s)]
*  And he's like, did you know all [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=277.76s)]
*  those future obligations that make [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=279.12s)]

*  Of course, why do you think we [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  want to balance the budget? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  Because we're paying so [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=284.32s)]
*  much in the interest, and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=285.56s)]
*  that's creating our future [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=286.88s)]
*  obligations. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=288.28s)]
*  This is the most elementary stuff. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  It's like going into a graduate [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=292.52000000000004s)]

*  Yeah, brother, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=299.24s)]
*  we covered that a while back, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  right? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=301.88s)]
*  So you're not, I mean, look, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=302.44s)]
*  I can't speak for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=304.16s)]

*  Rogan a little bit. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't know, when he mentioned [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  messing around with social [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=311.92s)]

*  his audience. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=316.32s)]

*  Joe Rogan's audience. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=319.4s)]
*  He thinks these idiots don't even [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=320.96s)]
*  know that we have to pay interest [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  and social security has more money [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=325.76s)]
*  goes in now from us and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=328.32s)]
*  then we get it later. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=329.79999999999995s)]
*  We all know that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=331.47999999999996s)]
*  Okay, anyways, so, but it's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=333.4s)]
*  curious that he never mentioned [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=335.56s)]
*  lifting the payroll tax cap, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=337.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, for the rest of us, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  we know why he didn't mention it [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=341.96s)]
*  because that would affect his taxes. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=343.79999999999995s)]
*  God forbid, the richest billionaire [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=346.12s)]

*  Besides which he doesn't even pay [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=357.88000000000005s)]
*  the goddamn taxes because he just [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=359.6s)]

*  we haven't really got social, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=371.68s)]

*  Trump promised we're not going to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=415.98s)]

*  They're not doing it through [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=422.34s)]
*  legislation, but they're doing it [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  in a roundabout way, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=425.5s)]
*  little by little, dismantling [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=426.58s)]
*  the social security administration. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=428.18s)]
*  So it was just reported that they [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=430.9s)]
*  are letting go of 7,000 social [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=433.14000000000004s)]

*  their Social Security money on time. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=521.94s)]
*  So Democratic Senator Patty Murray, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=525.9s)]
*  by the way, argues that, look, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=528.14s)]

*  was already short staffed. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=532.22s)]
*  In fact, there's a toll free [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=533.98s)]
*  number that beneficiaries can call [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=535.74s)]
*  if they're having any issues. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=538.02s)]
*  And the wait times had gotten [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=540.38s)]
*  longer and longer in regard to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=542.26s)]
*  those phone calls. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=544.02s)]
*  And it's because they don't have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=545.46s)]
*  the ability to respond to people [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=547.3s)]

*  field offices receive an additional [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=551.42s)]

*  30 million in-person visits. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=555.34s)]
*  So obviously, these offices closing [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=557.78s)]
*  is going to have a negative impact [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=559.78s)]
*  on beneficiaries. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=561.5s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=563.3s)]
*  it turns out that she's right. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=563.9s)]
*  Senator Murray is absolutely right [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=565.5s)]

*  they won't have anyone to complain [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=677.54s)]
*  to. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=679.66s)]
*  And I don't know, maybe in their [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=680.78s)]
*  infantile mind, they think that [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=682.3399999999999s)]
*  way will lower the number of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=684.06s)]
*  complaints just by not listening to [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=685.54s)]
*  them. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=687.5s)]
*  So, but if they cut deeper than [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=688.02s)]
*  that, I mean, even that will [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=690.3s)]
*  probably cause a significant amount [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=692.66s)]
*  of trouble. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=695.3399999999999s)]
*  But you cut any more than that, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=696.14s)]
*  you're dating, you're guaranteeing [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=698.14s)]
*  trouble with actually sending out [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=700.42s)]
*  the payments. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  And so, look guys, you're right [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=703.8199999999999s)]
*  wing, you don't believe me, just [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=705.86s)]

*  me about Biden, no problem. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=710.06s)]
*  But you're going to run into that [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=711.8199999999999s)]
*  brick wall. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=713.26s)]

*  They start to, we start to turn [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=721.62s)]
*  into a third world country, okay? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=723.42s)]
*  Make America destitute again. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS57Nd7aK4&t=726.22s)]
