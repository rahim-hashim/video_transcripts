"Fourth Street Evangelical Church preacher and conspiracy theorist author Andrew Isker used a portion of his right-wing current affairs podcast Contra Mundum to spread a baseless and ridiculous conspiracy theory that TSA body scanners in airports can make people queer.

Speaking with co-host C. Jay Engel, the right-wing pastor said he much prefers being frisked by TSA agents instead of going through what he unironically described as a ‚Äúgay beam‚Äù in the scanners."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Right-Wing Pastor Prefers To Get PATTED DOWN At The Airport
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c)
*  I had to be molested at the airport [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=0.0s)]
*  to go to Florida. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=2.0s)]
*  Right, just to get on an airplane [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  because I'm not going to go [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  through the gay beam machine. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=6.4s)]
*  I didn't let CJ do it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=8.02s)]
*  I wouldn't let him do it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=9.92s)]
*  Said you're getting [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=11.08s)]
*  patted down too, buddy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=12.08s)]
*  I don't want them turning you gay. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=13.32s)]
*  I mean, how would that even work? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=23.16s)]
*  That is evangelical preacher and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=26.88s)]
*  clearly conspiracy theorist Andrew [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  Iskher telling everybody he's not [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=31.72s)]
*  gay, but he wants to make sure he [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=34.04s)]
*  and his buddies get patted down by [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=36.04s)]
*  other dudes whenever possible. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=37.92s)]
*  He's not about to become gay from [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=39.44s)]
*  going through one of those airport [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=41.0s)]
*  scanners that make you gay. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=42.72s)]
*  That's for sure, despite how many [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=43.84s)]
*  men he then has to ask to touch his [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=45.72s)]
*  private parts at the airport. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  You just watched Iskher on his [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=50.08s)]
*  right wing current affairs podcast, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=51.8s)]
*  which is a logo by the way of him [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=54.64s)]
*  and two other dudes with their arms [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=56.28s)]
*  around each other. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=58.04s)]
*  It's called contra mundum, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=58.92s)]
*  spreading each truly insane [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=60.42s)]
*  conspiracy theory that TSA body [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=61.86s)]
*  scanners in airports can make [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=63.44s)]
*  people queer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=65.0s)]
*  Luckily Iskher determined there's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=66.36s)]
*  a much less gay option, and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=68.44s)]
*  that is having a male TSA worker [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=70.04s)]
*  feel you up. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=71.84s)]
*  Here's more. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=72.92s)]
*  It appears having a guy touch you [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=75.12s)]
*  all over the place is on his face [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=77.72s)]
*  seems worse. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=80.4s)]
*  But you don't really know what's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=81.56s)]
*  going on, what those things are [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  doing to you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=85.68s)]
*  So I'm- [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=86.64s)]
*  Where the imaging goes or [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=87.2s)]
*  what they're doing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=88.12s)]
*  Or yeah, because it's like- [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  What they're doing in the back. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=89.72s)]
*  Yeah, like, yeah, they can just [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=90.48s)]
*  take a picture of me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=92.28s)]
*  Sort of like- [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=93.88s)]
*  Like no. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=94.48s)]
*  Virtual adrenochrome system back [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=95.2s)]
*  there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=96.92s)]
*  Yeah, maybe, maybe, so. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=97.44s)]
*  He literally said, sure, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=103.84s)]
*  it seems worse to have a man touch [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  your private parts, but you don't [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=107.0s)]
*  know what the machine is doing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=108.88s)]
*  So not knowing, but for sure, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=110.72s)]
*  having basically a homosexual [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=113.32s)]
*  experience forced upon you by not [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=115.8s)]
*  forced because you opted into it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=118.6s)]
*  quite pleasantly. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=121.12s)]
*  And also they might want to see me [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=123.0s)]
*  naked. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=124.32s)]
*  I doubt it severely of all [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=124.84s)]
*  the candidates, but [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=126.52s)]
*  that's just my thoughts. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  James. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=129.16s)]
*  Here's the tell guys. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=131.66s)]
*  I've never thought, hey, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=133.4s)]
*  I wonder what turned me gay. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=135.16s)]
*  It never occurred to me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  I never thought, hey, I wonder if [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=140.4s)]
*  the gay beams in the TSA scanner [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  is turning me gay because I'm not [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=144.52s)]
*  gay. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  I never thought, I wonder if it's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  the microwave turning me gay or [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  the frogs or the water because I'm [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=151.56s)]
*  not gay. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  That thought has never crossed [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  my mind. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=155.96s)]
*  But for some of these brothers, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  they're constantly thinking, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  what's causing the gayness? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  What's turning me gay? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=161.24s)]
*  Is it that one? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  Is it that thing? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  Who's turning me gay? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=164.12s)]
*  You're kind of telling on yourself [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  and nothing wrong with it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=169.88s)]
*  You open arms here, okay? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=171.12s)]
*  But that's hilarious, brother. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=173.44s)]
*  And then of course, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=175.56s)]
*  the conspiracy theory that they're [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=176.76s)]
*  zapping you with what? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=179.36s)]
*  What could you zap someone with? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=181.28s)]
*  That rainbow string? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=184.4s)]
*  Rainbows, that's an idea, Ben. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  Good one. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=190.2s)]
*  Yes, that's true, could be. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=190.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=192.12s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=193.08s)]
*  And my question was similar just in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=194.4s)]
*  a sense of how exactly would this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=196.28s)]
*  technology work? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=198.2s)]
*  Every time you go through a check [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=199.68s)]
*  out line or something, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=201.52s)]

*  orientation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=204.6s)]
*  Like every time you got your sexual [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=205.84s)]
*  orientation got Tourette syndrome [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=208.2s)]
*  or something, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=210.88s)]
*  it just can't help itself. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=211.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, man. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=214.48s)]

*  a scanner, you know what I mean? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=219.72s)]
*  because that's how you stay on [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  track. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  Like squeeze my ass, man. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=224.24s)]
*  I got some metal in there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=225.48s)]

*  These people are strange. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  What was that dude's name? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=229.8s)]
*  I think he was a senator for [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  Iowa or Idaho or something and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=234.36s)]
*  he got caught in the bathroom in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=236.56s)]
*  the airport. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=238.72s)]
*  Yeah, Larry Craig. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=239.56s)]
*  The foot tap. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=240.32s)]
*  I mean, think about that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=241.8s)]
*  Like you can't go to a hotel, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=242.96s)]
*  you can't even wait to go back [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  home. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=246.8s)]
*  It's like you so freaky, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=247.4s)]
*  I need some strange in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=249.08s)]
*  an airport bathroom. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  No, no, Jackson. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=253.88s)]
*  You got it bad. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=254.84s)]
*  No, you just accidentally [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  figured it out. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=256.96s)]
*  Larry Craig was a Republican [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=257.8s)]
*  senator from Idaho. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=259.12s)]
*  They use a lot of rumors about how [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  he'd be soliciting men in [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=262.44s)]
*  bathrooms, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=264.2s)]
*  And then he got caught in a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=266.96s)]
*  Minnesota airport bathroom, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  I believe. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=270.44s)]
*  He was at an airport, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=271.76s)]
*  went through the scanner. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=273.32s)]
*  Otherwise known as the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=276.0s)]
*  KB machine. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=277.28s)]
*  Exactly, exactly, exactly. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=277.92s)]
*  See, I'll uncover the mystery [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=280.8s)]
*  without even thinking about it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=281.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=283.52s)]
*  So you're ignoring the very obvious [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=284.02s)]
*  fact here too, because this isn't [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  even a conspiracy theory I'd ever [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=288.34s)]
*  heard before. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=290.26s)]
*  It sounds like one he might have [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=291.06s)]
*  come up with himself. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=292.82s)]
*  And you have to from the story have [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=294.06s)]
*  to infer he hasn't always opted [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  out for the pat downs. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=298.26s)]
*  He's gone through the machine a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=300.62s)]
*  couple of times. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=302.06s)]
*  So he went through the machine at [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=302.82s)]
*  one point. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=304.7s)]
*  And then saw other dudes being [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=305.7s)]
*  felt up who didn't go through [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=307.7s)]
*  the machine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=309.74s)]
*  And right as he was going through [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=311.34s)]
*  the machine and seeing that he got [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=312.82s)]
*  funny feelings and funny thoughts. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=314.58s)]
*  And he thought, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  clearly it's the machine making me [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=317.94s)]
*  feel that way and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=320.29999999999995s)]
*  not the homoerotic thing I'm [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=321.46s)]
*  witnessing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=323.34s)]
*  Next time I'm going to have to be [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=324.46s)]
*  part of that feel up situation [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=326.46s)]
*  because this machine is a real [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=328.5s)]
*  queer maker. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=330.5s)]
*  I think we figured out in fact, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=331.41999999999996s)]
*  what did it? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=333.38s)]
*  It was him seeing some stuff go [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=334.5s)]
*  down and being oddly pleased by it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=336.53999999999996s)]
*  You also won't be shocked to learn [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=339.41999999999996s)]
*  that he is aggressively homophobic [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=341.3s)]
*  and not afraid to say it as they [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=343.3s)]
*  always are when they protest too [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  much in my guess. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=347.06s)]
*  Earlier this month he was on [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=348.86s)]
*  Tucker Carlson show. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=350.3s)]
*  Here's just a little taste of how [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=351.3s)]
*  that show went. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=353.34s)]
*  The former president of the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=355.3s)]
*  Southern Baptist Convention, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=356.94s)]
*  JD Greer, famously said in a [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=359.02s)]
*  sermon, well, the Bible just [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=360.82s)]
*  whispers about sexual sin, but [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=362.82s)]
*  it shouts about financial sin or [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=364.94s)]
*  greed, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  So they want to downplay the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=367.82s)]
*  It does and the two are connected, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=369.46s)]
*  right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  Right, if you're greedy for money, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=372.26s)]
*  you're also going to be lusting [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=374.53999999999996s)]
*  after the flesh like that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=376.38s)]
*  The two go hand in hand. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=378.06s)]
*  And so what is the downplay things [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=379.34s)]
*  that the culture does not want to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=381.78s)]
*  hear, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=384.18s)]
*  Because you'll be branded as a [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=385.18s)]
*  bigot, as intolerant, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=387.14s)]
*  as a bad person if you're just [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=388.62s)]
*  like, well, this is what [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=390.46s)]
*  the Bible says. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=391.9s)]
*  Fornicators, adulterers, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=392.94s)]
*  sodomites, they will not hear [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=394.58s)]
*  anything that's not true. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=396.41999999999996s)]
*  Sodomites, they will not hear [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=398.1s)]
*  the kingdom of God. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=399.54s)]
*  You don't have to believe it, but [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=400.46s)]
*  if you're a believing Christian, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=402.18s)]
*  it's not whispered at all. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=404.02s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=405.38s)]
*  You do have to believe it if [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=405.9s)]
*  you're a Christian. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=407.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=408.18s)]
*  You claim that this is the Bible [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=408.7s)]
*  that God spoke to you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=410.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so there is that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=414.46s)]
*  In my opinion, the man has far too [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=417.9s)]
*  thick and aggressive of a 70s porn [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=420.22s)]
*  mustache to be talking about this [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=422.58s)]
*  topic at all. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=424.78s)]
*  But that's just my uneducated [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=425.5s)]
*  guess. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=428.18s)]
*  It always is, however, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=430.22s)]
*  the people who claim that the Bible [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=431.94s)]
*  is saying that you can't be gay. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=434.26s)]
*  And then he just slips in and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=437.1s)]
*  conflates, which Tucker Carlson [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=438.54s)]
*  immediately agrees to. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=440.22s)]
*  He goes, plus, if you're a greedy [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=441.66s)]
*  person about money, you also are [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=444.9s)]
*  going to want the flesh. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=447.82s)]
*  But overly being addicted to sex [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=449.9s)]
*  is totally different than being [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=452.34s)]
*  gay. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=454.74s)]
*  Nobody says that gay people are [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=455.1s)]
*  inherently having more sex than [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=457.18s)]
*  straight people or married people. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=459.3s)]
*  There's married gay people. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=461.06s)]
*  There's people of all persuasions [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=462.34000000000003s)]
*  within all sexual preferences and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  persuasions. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=467.58s)]
*  And so that was a little strange [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=469.14s)]
*  as well. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=471.1s)]
*  Also, he claimed he had fled to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=471.86s)]
*  Tennessee because his home state [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=473.54s)]
*  of Minnesota had declared war on [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=475.38s)]
*  Christians. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=477.02s)]
*  And later in the interview, he and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=477.66s)]
*  Tucker went on and on about how [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=479.74s)]
*  without a religion like [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=481.42s)]
*  Christianity, sure, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=482.86s)]
*  what's to believe, but then what's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=484.26s)]
*  to stop you from murdering people? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=486.21999999999997s)]
*  He goes, you have no basis for it [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=488.18s)]
*  then. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=489.62s)]
*  There's nothing to ground you to [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=490.14s)]
*  that belief. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=491.46s)]
*  Some might think murder's good, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=492.14s)]
*  as though morality can only be [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=493.7s)]
*  based on fictional characters [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=495.18s)]
*  in the sky. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a lot of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=497.38s)]
*  interesting things in there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=498.82s)]
*  He's like, they call you a bigot, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=500.78s)]
*  but if you read the Bible, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=502.65999999999997s)]
*  it says that gay people can't get [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=504.26s)]
*  into heaven in the kingdom of God, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=506.06s)]
*  and gay people are this and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=507.94s)]
*  gay people are that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=509.38s)]
*  No, brother, you're just saying I [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=510.7s)]
*  am a bigot because of my [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=512.74s)]
*  interpretation of the Bible. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=514.14s)]
*  You're not saying you're not [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=515.9s)]
*  a bigot. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=517.1s)]
*  So in fact, you're admitting you're [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=517.62s)]
*  a bigot. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=519.9s)]
*  You're like, gay people are bad, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=520.42s)]
*  you shouldn't be gay. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=522.54s)]
*  Being gay is so bad, you'll go to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=523.9s)]
*  hell and be tortured forever [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=525.86s)]
*  instead of going to heaven, but [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=527.58s)]
*  I don't have anything against gay [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=529.5s)]
*  people. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=531.54s)]
*  No, you literally do, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=532.0600000000001s)]
*  you just said it, you just said it, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=533.0600000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=534.78s)]
*  So, and that's just his [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=535.3s)]
*  interpretation of the Bible. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=536.5s)]
*  Now, to a couple of Ben's points, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=537.98s)]
*  he says, well, you've lost your [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=540.3s)]
*  lust for greed, for money, and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=542.62s)]
*  homosexuality, of course, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=544.74s)]
*  both of those things are similar. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=546.66s)]
*  Are they? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=549.02s)]
*  Because I've wanted more money in [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=549.82s)]
*  my life, I'm human. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=551.98s)]
*  But I haven't lost it for [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=553.3s)]
*  homosexuality. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=554.94s)]
*  That guy just, everything he says, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=557.26s)]
*  well, obviously, I mean, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=559.22s)]
*  you're going to lust for [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=560.5s)]
*  homosexuality. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=561.54s)]
*  Obviously, everything's turning [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=562.22s)]

*  Is it obvious? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=564.34s)]
*  Is it obvious to all of us? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=565.98s)]
*  Wanting money is gay, Cenk, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=566.82s)]
*  wanting money is gay. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=568.1s)]
*  Yes, exactly, wanting money is gay. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=570.02s)]
*  But check out Elon Musk and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=573.0999999999999s)]
*  all of the W. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=574.78s)]

*  it seems just like a somewhat [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=581.5s)]
*  low-key addict obsession. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=583.9s)]
*  Like maybe he is a sex addict, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=586.6199999999999s)]
*  you know, sex addiction could be [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=588.4599999999999s)]

*  like that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=592.02s)]

*  he has some type, like he wakes up [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=594.6199999999999s)]
*  and he just can't stop looking at [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=596.4599999999999s)]
*  And obviously, you know, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=598.66s)]

*  If you're gay, be gay. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=600.18s)]
*  It's not a big deal. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=601.8599999999999s)]
*  But he does seem to have a really [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=603.2199999999999s)]
*  weird obsession with it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=604.9s)]
*  And the Bible says a lot of stuff. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=606.38s)]
*  The Bible is a lot of books. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=608.2199999999999s)]
*  It's not just one book. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_3l-C3t9c&t=609.5799999999999s)]
