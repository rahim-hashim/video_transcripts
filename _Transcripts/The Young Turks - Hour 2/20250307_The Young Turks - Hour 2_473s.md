TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Kamala Harris Considering Campaign For...
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU)
*  He's back, almost anyway. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=0.0s)]
*  Former Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=1.8s)]
*  has taken time away from politics [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=4.1s)]
*  ever since her loss to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=6.04s)]
*  Donald Trump last year. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=7.34s)]
*  But according to a recent [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=8.68s)]
*  political report, Harris is getting [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=10.38s)]
*  close to deciding her next move. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=12.88s)]
*  And that would be running for [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=14.96s)]
*  governor of California. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=17.32s)]
*  A lot more to report on it, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=19.32s)]
*  more details to cover. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=21.22s)]
*  But Jen, any initial thoughts here? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=23.12s)]
*  If she jumps in, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=25.36s)]
*  is it just a foregone conclusion? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=26.2s)]
*  No, that's my original first [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=28.4s)]
*  thought on it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=32.0s)]
*  So look, let's discuss two things [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=34.28s)]
*  here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=36.68s)]
*  One is should she run? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=37.4s)]
*  Two is should they clear the field [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  for her? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=40.56s)]
*  because of course that's what [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=41.1s)]
*  they're considering doing now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=42.48s)]
*  All right, Sharon, back to you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=44.4s)]
*  We're getting into all of that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=45.64s)]
*  Here's what political revealed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  today at a pre-Oscar's party last [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=48.64s)]
*  weekend. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Harris was asked by another party [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  goer when she would make a decision [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=52.8s)]
*  about jumping into the California [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=54.56s)]
*  governor's race. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=56.28s)]
*  And she gave a definitive answer, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=57.28s)]
*  according to two people with [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  knowledge of the conversation, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=61.2s)]
*  the end of the summer. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=63.38s)]
*  Apparently Harris is also [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  considering another run for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=67.6s)]
*  president in 2028. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=69.0s)]
*  Nothing is official just yet. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  But Harris has insisted in private [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=73.08s)]
*  conversations that I am staying in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=75.92s)]
*  this fight. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=78.8s)]
*  There are several California [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=81.08s)]
*  politicians who are considering a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=82.44s)]
*  run for governor unless Harris [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=84.08s)]
*  runs, unless she decides to do it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=85.84s)]
*  In which case they would step [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=89.52s)]
*  aside. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=91.08s)]
*  In fact, state attorney general [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=91.58s)]
*  Rob Bonta has already stated he [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=93.48s)]
*  will not run for governor at all [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=95.24s)]
*  due to the possibility, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=96.96s)]
*  just the possibility of Harris [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=98.32s)]
*  running as well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=100.12s)]
*  Other California politicians who [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  are considering a run for governor [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=103.98s)]
*  but would also step aside if Harris [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=106.12s)]
*  ran. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=108.12s)]

*  One poll by Emerson College inside [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=120.38s)]

*  How did that work out? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  A couple of months ago, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=245.5s)]

*  the presidential race and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=248.26000000000002s)]
*  then what happened? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=249.8s)]
*  She lost every swing state and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=251.82s)]

*  Why are we anointing? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=254.58s)]
*  So no, absolutely not. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=256.26s)]
*  And so, and is she likely to win [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=257.94s)]
*  if she runs? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=260.7s)]

*  California schizophrenic, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=272.82s)]
*  the Democratic voters in California. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=274.06s)]

*  their infinite arrogance think that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=331.74s)]

*  Is it? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=334.38s)]
*  Because tons of Republicans have [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=335.34s)]
*  won for governor, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=336.74s)]

*  runs for governor? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=342.82s)]

*  Kamala Harris. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=345.29999999999995s)]
*  And then the Democrats would get [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=346.38s)]

*  a Democrat? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=351.1s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=351.62s)]
*  He could run as a Democrat, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=353.14s)]
*  Republican, it doesn't matter. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=354.18s)]

*  I'm with you that I think [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=360.82s)]
*  California is due for a correction. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=362.3s)]
*  I think there is a sentiment, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=366.58s)]
*  a growing negative sentiment toward [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=368.98s)]
*  the Democratic elite in the state. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=372.86s)]
*  That I would not be surprised if [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=375.3s)]
*  a Republican won or [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=377.42s)]
*  a Republican wins in the near [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=378.7s)]
*  future. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=380.62s)]
*  That said, I do think if Harris [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=381.14s)]
*  were to run, name recognition alone [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=383.3s)]
*  and her experience at the state [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=385.94s)]

*  probably get her the nod. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=391.74s)]
*  That said, I don't think they [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=393.62s)]
*  should clear the field for her. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=394.94s)]
*  If she wants to run and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=396.22s)]
*  she if she has a chance, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=397.5s)]

*  and then they say let's not have [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=411.18s)]
*  elections. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=412.46000000000004s)]

*  Right, have a real primary and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=415.78000000000003s)]

*  though we're out of time, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  a lot of times they say this stuff [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=422.54s)]

*  The amount they get paid for [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=425.98s)]
*  speeches, books, etc goes up. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=427.38s)]

*  So or he says he isn't but [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=434.26s)]
*  it got leaked somehow. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=436.02s)]
*  And they do it to get paid more. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=437.9s)]
*  And then if she wins as governor, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=439.86s)]
*  remember she's still young, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=441.38s)]
*  then she could milk that for [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=442.82s)]
*  the rest of her career. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Z2B1XyUWU&t=444.02s)]
