TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Democrats Go Viral For ALL THE WRONG REASONS!
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo)
*  Now that TikTok has been making the rounds across the Internet and has been drawing a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=0.0s)]
*  lot of criticism from people on both sides of the aisle. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=26.24s)]
*  To be fair to the Democrats, it doesn't seem like they orchestrated the Super Smash Brothers [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=30.279999999999998s)]
*  inspired Choose Your Fighter video. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=34.82s)]
*  It was originally posted by influencer Solhee Jessica Wu, who's a content creator and a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=37.16s)]
*  TikTok user. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=43.28s)]
*  But now, the Democratic women featured in the video are getting ruthlessly made fun [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=44.72s)]
*  of. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=49.44s)]
*  Before we get to the reactions, let's take a closer look at some of those stats in the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=50.44s)]
*  video. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=53.72s)]
*  The first fighter, other than Wu herself, was AOC. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=54.72s)]
*  The description under her reads, positives. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=58.68s)]
*  New York's 14th congressional district and youngest woman and Latina to be elected to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=61.4s)]
*  the House. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=66.2s)]
*  Negative, Truckee. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=67.2s)]
*  Why is that a negative? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=68.2s)]
*  I didn't make the video. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=70.36s)]
*  Next up is Lauren Underwood. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=76.44s)]
*  Her bio reads, positives. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=78.16s)]
*  First black woman elected to Congress and co-founded the Black Maternal Office. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=80.32s)]
*  Negatives, hates balloons. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm with her there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  Can't stand balloons, they're awful. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  So that's a positive for me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=92.36s)]
*  It doesn't get any better though. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=95.63999999999999s)]
*  We have Judy Chu. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=97.52s)]
*  Her description says positives, California's 28th congressional district and first Chinese [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=99.06s)]
*  American woman elected to Congress. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=103.44s)]
*  Negatives, too sweet. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  That's a positive for me. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=108.44s)]
*  Anyway, you get the idea. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=110.16s)]
*  Catherine Clark, Jasmine Crockett and Susie Lee were the other featured fighters. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=111.72s)]
*  We'll caption the video with the hashtags, women who fight, save democracy and girl power. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=116.36s)]
*  Innocent enough, but now it's getting attention for all the wrong reasons. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=122.84s)]
*  These are just a few of the thousands of responses the video solicited. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=126.88s)]
*  One ex user wrote simply, what are we doing? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=130.84s)]
*  Another said, this made me decide to not pay my taxes this year. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=135.6s)]
*  Ex user Matthew Donlon said, we're never getting healthcare. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=141.44s)]
*  Even Jake Tapper was not impressed who wrote, the best part about this is presumably this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=145.72s)]
*  is precisely to reassure their voters that they figured out how to be an effective opposition [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=154.26s)]
*  party. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=160.0s)]
*  And a haymaker there, Jake. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=161.68s)]
*  Republicans all the way up to the White House are taking advantage of the skit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=163.44s)]
*  Trump's rapid response account tweeted, Democrats not be cringe challenge, level impossible. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=167.68s)]
*  Jake, I don't know if I hate this video as much as some people, but what do you make [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=174.56s)]
*  of it? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  I don't hate it that much either. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  That might be shocking, okay? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=182.8s)]
*  Here's why, is it cringe? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=184.96s)]
*  I don't love that word, but yeah, I get it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=190.28s)]
*  So are these lame attempts like Chuck Schumer talking about the billionaire buddies and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=191.28s)]
*  all the Democrats doing TikToks where they're clearly reading from a consultant script? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=197.52s)]
*  Not the right way to go, of course, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=204.16s)]
*  The reason why I don't hate this video is at least they tried something. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=206.32s)]
*  I'm so, we're running out of oxygen, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=210.68s)]
*  The Democrats won't do anything at all. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=215.08s)]
*  And with Hakeem Jeffries coming out nonstop and being like, well, we've got no leverage. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=217.76s)]
*  So now the bar is so low for Democrats that if they're not crying on camera, like, hey, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=225.48s)]
*  okay, look at that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=231.84s)]
*  At least they got some pep in their step and it looks like they wanna fight. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=233.2s)]
*  I mean, I prefer to see the actual fight, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=235.88s)]
*  I'd love to see that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=238.72s)]
*  But that's why I was like, well, at least they tried something and I feel bad about [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=240.32s)]
*  ragging on him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=244.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=245.52s)]
*  Yeah, sure, it's cringe by conventional standards, but weren't we just talking about how they [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=246.52s)]
*  needed a better digital strategy? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  It wasn't like these members of Congress came together. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=255.68s)]
*  This was a TikTok creator who put this together. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=258.64s)]
*  She collaborated with many members of Congress to do this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=262.44s)]
*  This is her thing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=265.08s)]
*  If it fits for her account, okay, great. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=266.08s)]
*  This wasn't like a DNC official video. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=268.8s)]
*  They're just having fun. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I hear the thing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  You wanna be in a firm and a legit opposition party. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't necessarily knock some of those people for that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  Crockett has been pretty firm, AOC has been pretty firm. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=285.4s)]
*  AOC is out there constantly directly messaging to people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  We've talked about that before. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, if it was Pelosi doing that, maybe the criticisms would be a lot stronger. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=294.56s)]
*  But this video, to some, is an example of why polling is showing that Democrats are [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=301.8s)]
*  losing faith in their party's ability to oppose Donald Trump. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  According to a survey by the liberal firm Blueprint, a plurality of voters, 40%, said [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  the Democratic Party doesn't have any strategy whatsoever for responding to Trump. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  Another 24% said Democrats have a game plan, but it's a bad one. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  A paltry 10% said that the party has a solid technique for dealing with Trump, and that's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=326.96s)]
*  coming from a Democratic Outfits survey. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=332.08s)]
*  Evan Roth Smith, the top pollster for Blueprint, says of the survey results, voters correctly [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=334.84s)]
*  identified the Democratic Party has lost its way. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  The Democratic response Tuesday night was more or less a continuation of what we've [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=343.56s)]
*  seen from Democrats so far, which is there was nothing overtly wrong about it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=348.34s)]
*  But it didn't actually do anything to ameliorate this core issue Democrats face, which is voters [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=352.76s)]
*  aren't quite sure what we stand for and would like us to get back to the basic principles [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=357.92s)]
*  of the party. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=364.06s)]
*  Now, I don't know, Cenk, you don't think holding up signs in the audience was enough to fight [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=365.06s)]
*  back against Trump? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so again, look guys, the way that they deliver this stuff is just awful, eight out [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=370.92s)]
*  of ten times that I'm being generous there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=375.52s)]
*  But I had the same thoughts that Jordan did, like AOC and Jasmine Crockett, to be fair, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=377.76s)]
*  the ones that are taking the most action, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=384.0s)]
*  Along with Ro Khanna and Bernie Sanders, I like Ro Khanna and Bernie Sanders strategy [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=386.96s)]
*  better. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=390.36s)]
*  I think that Crockett and AOC sometimes slip too much into identity politics, and I don't [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=391.36s)]
*  think that that's that helpful. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=395.32s)]
*  But at least they're doing something, and at least they have a strategy, and at least [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=397.28s)]
*  they're out there fighting, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=400.28s)]
*  So it's not the right target for like, haha, you were so wrong to do this video, in my [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=401.96s)]
*  opinion. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=408.12s)]
*  But this thing of Democrats don't know what to do is so frustrating to me, but it's also [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=409.12s)]
*  very indicative. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=413.23999999999995s)]
*  I know what to do, because I care about the issues. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  I know that, as I said earlier in the show, I'd find waste, fraud, and abuse, $30 billion [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=417.96s)]
*  in oil subsidies, and I'd make a giant stink out of it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  Why aren't we cutting this? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=426.24s)]
*  Why aren't we cutting this? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=427.24s)]
*  Why aren't we cutting this, right? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=428.24s)]
*  I would then go affirmative. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=429.24s)]
*  And I said, why don't we pass paid family leave? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  It's polling at 84%, polling at 84%, right? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=432.88000000000005s)]
*  I would pound these messages home on actual issues, winning issues. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=435.56s)]
*  And they say, well, Trump's flooding the zone. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=439.72s)]
*  I said that from day one. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=441.36s)]
*  I get it, I understand it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  I called it out, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=444.20000000000005s)]
*  All right, then adjust. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  At least pick two or three things and attack those. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  If your answer is do nothing or just put up lame placards, it's not the right answer. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=452.06s)]
*  And the fact that they don't even know what to fight on shows that they don't care that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=460.0s)]
*  much. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=465.12s)]
*  We care, we care about the lead, we care about cutting the cancer research, we care about [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  all these things. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  So it's easy for us, because that animates us. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's easy to not go in the wrong direction, because I know what's helpful and not helpful, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  right? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=479.72s)]
*  But these guys, they don't have any idea, they're just sitting around waiting for the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=480.72s)]
*  consultants to tell them what to do. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=483.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, the bigger problem for me is what you're saying. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  The Democratic leadership who are just kind of flying blind right now, who aren't giving [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=487.48s)]
*  people clear, concise messaging or directives to the rank and file on how to fight back [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=492.52000000000004s)]
*  effectively. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=497.8s)]
*  When you have Akim Jeffries saying, well, presidents come and go, but God is forever. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=498.8s)]
*  How does that inspire- [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=502.56s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=503.56s)]
*  What is that? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=505.12s)]
*  How is that a strategy? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=506.12s)]
*  How is that anything? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=507.66s)]
*  And you mentioned Akim Jeffries, real quick, sorry to interrupt, Jordan. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=508.66s)]
*  He went to Palo Alto right after the election to talk to his donors to ask them what to [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=513.0s)]
*  do. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  And then a lot of donors said they're leaving and some of them were going to Trump. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  So then he left, came back home, didn't know what to do, because he didn't get his marching [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=522.0s)]
*  orders from the donors. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=525.6s)]
*  It's absolutely pathetic. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=526.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's sad. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=528.4000000000001s)]
*  So I mean, we had a conversation right after the election, Democrats need to engage with [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=530.88s)]
*  the media more, influencers more, be smarter on digital, smarter on social media. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=535.84s)]
*  They're working with somebody who knows how to do it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  Maybe pick your battles. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kntYEo-_mfo&t=541.72s)]
