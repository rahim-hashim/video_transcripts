Why it matters: Members of the Steering and Policy Committee ‚Äî with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) in the room ‚Äî on Monday complained activist groups like MoveOn and Indivisible have facilitated thousands of phone calls to members' offices."

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# REPORT: Democrats Are ANNOYED Over Voters' Desperate Calls For Action From Them
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI)
*  I'm trying to figure out what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=0.0s)]
*  leverage we actually have. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=1.76s)]
*  What leverage do we have? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=3.58s)]
*  They control the House, the Senate, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=5.32s)]
*  and the presidency. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=7.78s)]
*  It's their government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  What leverage do we have? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=11.74s)]
*  Last Friday, House Minority Leader [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=15.52s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, the gentleman you [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=17.7s)]
*  just heard from, seemed kind of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=20.02s)]
*  frustrated at the notion that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=22.06s)]
*  Democratic voters are wanting their [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers to vote for [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=26.5s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers to do [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=28.7s)]
*  something, to do anything. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=30.46s)]
*  To essentially fight back against [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=32.66s)]
*  what's currently transpiring with [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  Republicans, their efforts to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=37.12s)]
*  advance Trump's agenda. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=39.26s)]
*  And honestly, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=41.22s)]
*  what's happening at [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  the executive branch? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=42.82s)]
*  I mean, we haven't really heard [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=44.22s)]
*  much from Democratic lawmakers. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=45.66s)]
*  Yes, there's been a rally here or [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=47.1s)]
*  there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  Usually those rallies are [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=49.42s)]
*  incredibly embarrassing and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=50.9s)]
*  accomplish nothing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=52.46s)]
*  It's very clear there's no strategy [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=54.1s)]
*  in place whatsoever. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=56.260000000000005s)]
*  And now, thanks to a new scoop [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=57.900000000000006s)]
*  from Axios, Jeffries is apparently [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=60.02s)]
*  furious with grassroots Democrats [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  who want their elected leaders to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=65.3s)]
*  take action. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=67.72s)]
*  It's just so pathetic. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=70.22s)]
*  So we'll get to that newer report [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=71.38s)]
*  momentarily, but [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=72.98s)]
*  first a bit of context. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=73.82000000000001s)]
*  So a week ago, Axios broke [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=75.18s)]
*  a different report stating that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=77.06s)]
*  congressional Democrats were [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=79.38s)]
*  getting an unprecedented volume of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=81.74000000000001s)]
*  calls to their offices. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=84.38s)]
*  So some staffers said that they [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=86.58s)]
*  hadn't seen this many calls since [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=88.46s)]
*  seminal events like the October 7th [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=90.5s)]
*  attack, the Brett Kavanaugh [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=92.88s)]
*  hearings, or even the Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=94.82s)]
*  impeachment proceedings. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=96.7s)]
*  Now get a load of this, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=99.06s)]
*  Representative Mark Pocan stated, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  we had the most calls we've ever [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=102.46s)]
*  had in one day last Monday in 12 [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=104.4s)]
*  years. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=106.3s)]
*  And Representative Jim McGovern [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=106.9s)]
*  told Axios, I can't recall ever [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=109.34s)]
*  receiving this many calls. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=111.74s)]
*  People are disgusted with [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=113.82s)]
*  what's going on, and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=115.98s)]
*  they want us to fight back. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of amazing that they need [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=120.34s)]
*  a high volume of calls from their [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=122.34s)]
*  own constituents to understand that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=124.14s)]
*  their constituents would want them [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=126.30000000000001s)]
*  to do anything. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=128.5s)]
*  But okay, some of those calls were [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  coordinated by grassroots [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=131.66s)]
*  organizations including MoveOn and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  Indivisible. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=135.46s)]
*  A spokesperson for Indivisible [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=136.9s)]
*  confirmed to Axios that they did in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=139.1s)]
*  fact direct people to call [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=141.46s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  they directed them to call over [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=144.98s)]
*  30,000 calls to Democratic senators [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=147.26s)]
*  and over 4,000 calls to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=150.14s)]
*  representatives in just two weeks. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=151.98s)]
*  But Axios explained that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=154.7s)]
*  congressional Democrats are not [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=156.14s)]
*  really appreciating this, they're [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=158.06s)]
*  actually pretty irritated by it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=160.24s)]
*  One anonymous House Democrat, and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=162.22s)]
*  you can understand why they want to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=164.34s)]
*  be anonymous, stated the following. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=166.38s)]
*  There has definitely been some [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  tension the last few days where [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=170.42s)]
*  people felt like they were [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=172.26s)]
*  calling the wrong people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=173.78s)]
*  You are literally calling the wrong [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=175.54s)]
*  people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=177.5s)]
*  Okay, well, who are they supposed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=179.06s)]
*  to call? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=180.74s)]
*  Senator Richard Blumenthal is about [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=181.3s)]
*  to explain. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=183.62s)]
*  What I think we need to do more is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  put the onus on Republicans so that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=187.38s)]
*  the calls that we're getting are [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=190.54s)]
*  directed toward Republicans. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=193.5s)]
*  Why would Republican lawmakers care [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=198.26s)]
*  about what Democratic lawmakers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=200.66s)]
*  Democratic voters think? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=203.02s)]
*  Democratic voters aren't going to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=205.86s)]
*  vote for them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=207.78s)]
*  They're voting for [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=208.86s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers who are [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=210.06s)]
*  totally abandoning them and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=212.1s)]
*  doing nothing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=213.94s)]
*  Look, everyone understands that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=215.78s)]
*  Republicans are in charge right [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  now, everyone understands that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump is the president and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=220.62s)]
*  Republicans have a majority in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=222.38s)]
*  Congress in both the House and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=224.02s)]
*  the Senate, we get it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=225.78s)]
*  But there is a clear distinction [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=228.38s)]
*  between Democrats and Republicans [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=230.22s)]
*  when the shoe is on the other foot [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=232.34s)]
*  and Republicans don't have [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  the majority in the House or Senate [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  and when a Democrat is in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=237.78s)]
*  the executive branch. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  They find other creative ways to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=240.9s)]
*  fight back. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=243.18s)]
*  But you don't see that from [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=244.9s)]

*  was part of that complainathon. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=339.94000000000005s)]
*  An anonymous senior House Democrat [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=341.98s)]
*  said Jeffries himself is very [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=344.42s)]

*  You're frustrated that as the House [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  minority leader, Democratic voters [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=363.06s)]
*  are expecting you to fight back [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=366.06s)]
*  against the Republicans' agenda? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=368.29999999999995s)]
*  Okay, the spokesperson for [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=370.9s)]
*  Jeffries, though, says that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  characterization was incorrect and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=375.38s)]
*  that the House minority leader had [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=378.18s)]
*  actually spoken to stakeholder [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=380.7s)]
*  groups like MoveOn and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=383.06s)]
*  Indivisible as recently as Monday. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=384.74s)]
*  And the co-founder of Indivisible [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=387.54s)]
*  did tell Axios the following. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=389.38s)]
*  Our supporters are asking [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=391.1s)]
*  Democrats to demand specific red [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=392.74s)]
*  lines are met before they offer [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=395.1s)]
*  their vote to House Republicans on [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=397.3s)]
*  the budget when Republicans [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=399.9s)]
*  inevitably fail to pass the bill [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=402.1s)]
*  on their own. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=404.66s)]
*  And look, there's truth to that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=406.74s)]
*  So right now there is some [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=408.66s)]
*  significant infighting in [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=410.14000000000004s)]
*  the Republican House caucus. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  Because remember, you have [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=414.02000000000004s)]
*  the far right group, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  the House Freedom Caucus. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=416.54s)]
*  I mean, they just want to burn [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=418.02000000000004s)]
*  everything down. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=420.06s)]
*  And they're threatening to vote no [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=421.74s)]
*  on the budget if they don't get [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=424.1s)]
*  everything they want. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=426.06s)]
*  Well, then you have the more [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=427.98s)]
*  moderate Republicans who serve in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=429.94s)]
*  swing districts, and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=432.3s)]
*  they don't want to go that far. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=433.74s)]
*  So there is a possibility that with [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=436.06s)]
*  the slim majority Republicans have, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=438.02000000000004s)]
*  Democrats could have some leverage. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=440.14000000000004s)]
*  Let's hear about that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  Let's see what the strategy is, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=443.90000000000003s)]
*  but so far nothing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=445.5s)]
*  I think what Indivisible is asking [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=447.22s)]
*  for totally makes sense. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=448.86s)]
*  But again, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=450.02000000000004s)]
*  congressional Democrats are [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=450.62s)]
*  insisting that their constituents [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=452.22s)]
*  should go bother Republicans [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=453.94s)]
*  instead because Republicans really [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=455.42s)]
*  care about what Democratic voters [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=457.26s)]
*  have to say. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=458.98s)]
*  Representative Don Beyer said [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=459.58000000000004s)]
*  the following. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=461.70000000000005s)]
*  It's been a constant theme of us [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=463.34000000000003s)]
*  saying, please call the Republicans. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=465.18s)]
*  So if you're wondering whether [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=468.90000000000003s)]
*  Democrats like Jeffries are doing [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=470.46s)]

*  And to be clear, based on what [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  House Republicans are considering [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqST6_qxMI&t=484.58s)]
