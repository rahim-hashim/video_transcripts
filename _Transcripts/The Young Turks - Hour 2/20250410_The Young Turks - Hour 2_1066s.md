# Trump Accuses Ex-Staffer Of 'Treason' Over Criticism
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8)
*  Who the hell is Miles Taylor? And he made a living on going on CNN talking about the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=0.0s)]
*  president. And I think what he did, he wrote a book anonymous and all sorts of lies, bad things. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=5.84s)]
*  And I think it's like a traitor. I think it's a very important case and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=12.72s)]
*  I think he's guilty of treason, if you wanna know the truth. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=18.72s)]
*  That is President Trump yesterday who signed a memorandum directing the DOJ to investigate [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=21.36s)]
*  two people including former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor over anonymous op-ed [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  and book he wrote criticizing Trump during his first term. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=35.44s)]
*  Now before we get into the details, I'd love to get your initial take, Cenk. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=38.64s)]
*  Yeah, so there's two guys here, Taylor and then Chris Krebs, right? They're both outrageous in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=42.0s)]
*  their own ways. I think Krebs is the what they're doing and Krebs is even more outrageous. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=47.76s)]
*  He's the guy inside the Trump administration that said, yeah, there was no cheating. The [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  2020 election was real. And for that crime, they are now launching an investigation of him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=58.4s)]
*  This is exactly what an authoritarian state would do. But let's give you all the details. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=65.36s)]
*  Yeah, Miles Taylor served as the deputy chief of staff in the DHS during Trump's first term. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=69.2s)]
*  He was a strong critic of the president pending the infamous anonymous op-ed piece in 2018 titled, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=77.36s)]
*  I am part of the resistance inside the Trump administration. I work for the president, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=83.04s)]
*  but like-minded colleagues and I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=87.28s)]
*  inclinations. Taylor also then published a book titled A Warning, again anonymously the following [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=91.44s)]
*  year. Miles confirmed he was the author of both pieces in 2020, writing in a statement at the time, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=96.96s)]
*  when I left the administration, I wrote a warning, a character study of the current [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=102.96s)]
*  commander in chief and a caution to voters that it wasn't as bad as it looked inside the Trump [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=106.32s)]
*  administration. It was worse. While I claim sole authorship of the work, the sentiments expressed [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  within it were widely held among officials at the highest levels of the federal government. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=114.56s)]
*  In other words, Trump's own lieutenants were alarmed by his instability. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump was critical of the pieces at the time, but he decided to take retaliatory action against [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=124.0s)]
*  Taylor yesterday. Take a look at this video. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=128.4s)]
*  A special memorandum we have for you relates to Miles Taylor. You may recall that Miles Taylor [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=130.24s)]
*  served in the Department of Homeland Security during your previous administration. What this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=136.88s)]
*  presidential memorandum is going to do, one, it's going to strip any act of clearance that he has [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  in light of his past activities involving classified information. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  It's also going to order the Department of Justice to investigate his activities to see [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=150.08s)]
*  what else might come up in that context, given his egregious behavior during your [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=155.44s)]
*  previous administration. And I had no idea who this guy was. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=159.2s)]
*  He wrote a book, Anonymous, and I always thought it was terrible. Now we have a chance to find out [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=162.56s)]
*  whether or not it was terrible. But it was a work of fiction. He had a lot of publicity, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=167.84s)]
*  got himself a nice job with CNN or one of them. And I think we have to do something about it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=174.32s)]
*  You can't have that happen. If that happens to other presidents, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=179.84s)]
*  it wouldn't be sustainable for other presidents. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=182.48s)]
*  And as you heard in the first video, Trump went so far as to accuse Taylor of treason, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=188.72s)]
*  which is a capital offense for his work. In addition to Taylor, Trump signed a memo going [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=194.88s)]
*  after Chris Krebs, the former director of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=199.12s)]
*  Security Agency. Krebs in 2020 pushed back against Trump's bogus claim that the election [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=202.8s)]
*  had been fraudulent and was adamant that the nation's elections were not compromised. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=208.72s)]
*  Let's hear from Trump directly on Krebs. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=213.2s)]
*  Similarly, sir, Christopher Krebs, the former head of CISA. This is a man who weaponized [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=215.68s)]
*  his position against free speech in the election context, in the context of COVID-19. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=223.76s)]
*  This is another, it's a similar presidential memorandum to the one you just signed. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=230.16s)]
*  We're gonna find out about this guy too, because this guy's a wise guy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=234.64s)]
*  He said, we've been proved this is the most secure election in the history of our country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=238.48s)]
*  Now, this was a disaster. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=242.72s)]
*  So, Cenk, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. But to me, I agree with you, Krebs, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=248.64s)]
*  the Krebs situation is far more egregious because this is a man just claiming facts and doing so [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  in accordance with his job. Whereas while what he's doing in the other situation with Taylor is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=259.76s)]
*  also pretty egregious, I think it's also to a degree understandable. You should, as president, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=265.2s)]
*  be entitled, at least in your own mind, to have the things you're working out within your own office [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=271.68s)]
*  not be leaked by somebody who's saying he's actively thwarting you from within the White House. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=277.44s)]
*  So in the twisted context of what Trump's reality would be, that makes more sense than going after [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=282.48s)]
*  a man doing his job. Yeah, I mean, it's a low bar what they're doing to Krebs is so unconscionable. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=289.2s)]
*  Taylor being a little bit better situation than that is it doesn't help too much. But I agree with [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  you, let's break it down. First on Taylor, so they say, but he leaked, right? So weaponizing [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=301.52s)]
*  the Justice Department against him is not such a bad thing. Well, first of all, guys, every [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=307.76s)]
*  administration has leaks. And by the way, not only negative leaks about the administration, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  tons of positive leaks done within the administration, and that's usually rewarded. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=316.8s)]
*  And that happens on the Republicans and Democrats. So there's always been a giant hypocrisy about [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=324.0s)]
*  that. Number two, we're talking about leaks of potential national security information. First of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=327.76s)]
*  all, I don't remember any national security information that Taylor revealed, but I do know [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=334.0s)]
*  there were top secret national security documents in a bathroom in Mar-a-Lago. But that's totally [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=338.88s)]
*  okay. If you're leaking all over, like literally in a bathroom, okay, that's fine. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=344.4s)]
*  But if this guy does it, that's a problem. But and it seems like a very broad investigation. So [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  there's tons of things that are wrong with it. But if it was just at, hey, wait, let's investigate [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=355.52s)]
*  what he leaked and was it classified or not classified? Okay, that's at least defensible, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  all right? So if they go beyond that, not defensible. And I'm worried about what they're [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  going to do in terms of ramifications of basically a political opponent here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=371.84s)]
*  Nine out of ten times the government lets this go. But one out of ten times they don't. I mean, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=376.4s)]
*  ask Edward Stone and Chelsea Manning, right? Now those were actual national security stuff. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=381.44s)]
*  I think they were heroes for revealing that. But that's a different issue here. I don't remember [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=386.23999999999995s)]
*  much national security information that Miles Taylor revealed. But at least they have a leg [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=391.12s)]
*  to stand on to see if he leaked anything that was classified. Okay, now you move over to Krebs, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=396.56s)]
*  no leg to stand on at all. They said he weaponized his position. Trump asked, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=402.08s)]
*  was there fraud in this election? He looked at all of the information. He's on the Trump team. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=408.56s)]
*  He was appointed by Trump. He wants Trump to win. But he looks at the information and goes, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=415.28s)]
*  I'm sorry, Mr. President, there wasn't fraud and so you did actually lose. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=420.16s)]
*  That's not weaponizing his position. That's just telling you what happened. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  They're like, how dare you say the truth? That's it, Justice Department, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=428.64s)]
*  investigate my political opponent. Well, he's not even your opponent, dude. You're the one who [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  put him in charge in the first place. And so he had the crime of telling the truth. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  Now here we are in 1984, right? Truth is lies, lies are truth. And so he was a wise guy. What [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  does that mean? What does he was a wise guy mean? So and if you thought that Joe Biden weaponizes [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=451.2s)]
*  Justice Department against Donald Trump, look, I don't agree. But okay, let's grant it to you [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  for a second. Because I hear this what aboutism all the time, right? Well, what about Biden? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so now you say that's why we should also break the law. We should also trash the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=469.76s)]
*  Constitution. We should also weaponize the Justice Department against the guy who didn't do anything [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=475.76s)]
*  wrong but do his job. You must be so proud if that's your principled position. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=480.56s)]
*  Now what they're doing to Krebs is exactly why I voted against Donald Trump. Because he doesn't [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=486.72s)]
*  respect the Constitution at all, not 1%. And here he is now using the Justice Department to carry [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=491.44s)]
*  out personal grievances against people who are telling the truth about him. What do you think? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=499.2s)]
*  In Trump's defense though, Cenk, you can't be allowing somebody to use truth to, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=504.88000000000005s)]
*  you use truth basically as a weapon against the reality you invent in your own head. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=511.12s)]
*  So I do understand Trump's perspective on that. The news of the investigation into [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=515.12s)]
*  Taylor and Krebs was not taken lightly, has not been. To say the very least, take a look at this. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=520.48s)]
*  So Ellie, what does this mean for Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=525.84s)]
*  Well, look, it's big trouble for them. I mean, let's be real here because ordinarily, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=528.32s)]
*  this is something a president would never do, has never done, which is issue a formal [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=533.2s)]
*  proclamation saying, I order you, the Justice Department, to open a criminal investigation of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=536.72s)]
*  these two individuals. Now, what's missing from the proclamation is any evidence, any indication [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=541.52s)]
*  that either of these people committed a crime. You just heard some of the general language. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=548.08s)]
*  If you look at the proclamations, the big accusation is they are, quote, bad faith players. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=552.16s)]
*  But let me say- Wise guys. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  Wise guys, right? I mean, not a crime. Here's the thing though. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=557.84s)]
*  The ball is now in Pam Bondi's court and she's shown us where her loyalties sit with the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=562.56s)]
*  administration by her refusal to even look into the signal controversy. Even if she opens an [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  investigation and finds no crimes, that's a big deal. Getting investigated is stressful, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=573.6s)]
*  it's terrifying, it's costly, it can damage reputations. So this is very serious. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=577.92s)]
*  This retribution tour has gotten personal and very dark now. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=582.24s)]
*  Very dark indeed and others have chimed in on ex editor and CEO of the Dispatch and NBC News [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  political analyst Stephen Hayes tweeted in response to Krebs, outrageous. Trump is targeting [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=590.08s)]
*  by name a civil servant widely respected by both Republicans and Democrats. And he's doing so in [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=596.08s)]
*  service of his false claims thoroughly and repeatedly debunked that he won the 2020 election. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=601.36s)]
*  This won't stop here. Tim Miller, host of the Bulwark podcast and MSNBC analysts also wrote, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=606.08s)]
*  this is madness. Chris Krebs was a public servant, a GOP appointee who did his job ensuring the 2020 [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=612.72s)]
*  election was secure. For a government to target him like this is appalling and Stalin-esque. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=618.24s)]
*  Any person who reveres our constitutional republic should speak out against it. But of course, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=623.12s)]
*  the Magna World will not because their reverence for the constitution is very rubber band-esque [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=629.52s)]
*  as it bounces back and forth based on the way Trump tells them to feel about it based on [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  his whimsical opinions. Yeah. So the last thing is when does it cross over to authoritarianism? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=639.36s)]
*  Well, step one is Trump saying I would like to be authoritarian. I would like to imprison [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=644.0s)]
*  people who said that I lost the last election. Well, I got bad news for you, Donald Trump. 70% [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=650.08s)]
*  of the country thinks you lost the last election. Another 30% have been massively lied to by you [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=655.12s)]
*  and right wing media. Donald Trump didn't come close to winning that election. He was a very [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=660.8s)]
*  right wing media. Now, if we were to cheat as Democrats, etc., then why didn't they cheat in [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=665.6s)]
*  2024? Why didn't they cheat in 2016? You can just get all the BS excuses. Why did Donald Trump lose [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=672.96s)]
*  61 cases in a row? BS excuses. No, in the reality-based world, look, Trump already won [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=680.08s)]
*  two terms. He's president right now. He's got another four brutal years ahead of him, okay? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  Brutal for us. Can you just let it go, guys? Trump and MAGA, he didn't win the 2020 election. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=693.92s)]
*  No sane person thinks 61 court cases in a row, including Trump appointed judges, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=702.4s)]
*  were all like, we're in on it. Or we're scared of black rioters. No, he didn't win. He didn't win. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=708.4s)]
*  Jesus Christ, man. What a bunch of sore loser crybabies, especially after he won in 2024. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=716.24s)]
*  And he's currently the president. Okay, now, apparently, though, 70% of the country can get [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=723.12s)]
*  arrested and investigated by the Justice Department. So Trump is already authoritarian. He's [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=728.5600000000001s)]
*  declaring, I would love to trash the Constitution, weaponize the Justice Department, and go after my [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=733.12s)]
*  political opponents and anyone who dares tell the truth about the 2020 election. So that's exactly [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=740.32s)]
*  why I voted against them. Number two is Justice Department. The Justice Department is not supposed [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=746.32s)]
*  to be Donald Trump's personal attorney. They're supposed to actually represent the American people. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=751.2s)]
*  No sane Justice Department are decent or honest. Justice Department would pick up this investigation. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=755.12s)]
*  Will Pam Bondi do it? Of course she will. She was picked to serve Trump, not the American people. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=760.08s)]
*  She will betray the American people. She'll violate her oath in office, and she'll do exactly as Trump [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=766.48s)]
*  orders her. That's step two. Step three is the most important step by far. This eventually will [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=772.32s)]
*  get to the courts. So if they bring in Chris Krebs to a court and they say, he said that Donald [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=778.0s)]
*  Trump didn't win the 2020 election, we want to throw him in a gulag, right? The courts have to [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=784.64s)]
*  say, get the F out of here. No, no, you're not going to let you arrest people and put them in jail [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=790.0s)]
*  because they accurately believe that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=797.28s)]
*  So I believe the courts will do that. I believe the courts will easily throw away these garbage [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=802.32s)]
*  cases that are totally unconstitutional. But if the courts don't hold, then that's it. Then we've [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=810.24s)]
*  slipped into authoritarianism. And then, hey, everybody's fair game because the overwhelming [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=815.6s)]
*  majority of the country thinks he lost that election because he did lose that election. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=822.24s)]
*  What he's targeting here is not just his political opponents. He's targeting the truth [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=826.48s)]
*  because Donald Trump hates the truth. He's a legendary, lifelong con man. He loves lying. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=831.76s)]
*  He's a pathological liar. And he's so deeply insecure. He's one of the weakest people I have [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=838.96s)]
*  ever seen in public life. So he can't deal psychologically with the fact that he lost, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=845.52s)]
*  he lost the 2020 election. And his thin skin knows no bounds. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=853.12s)]
*  Brother, you're the president. You're the commander in chief. Focus on the goddamn job. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=857.44s)]
*  It's like, my feelings were hurt in 2020. They thought I was a loser because you were. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=865.0400000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't matter because you won this election. But nope, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=871.0400000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's ego must be satiated even if you have to burn the Constitution to do it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  So exactly what we heard about Trump. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=879.5200000000001s)]
*  And I only disagree with one thing you said. You said no sane person can believe that [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=881.68s)]
*  he actually won the election in 2020. And I just disagree with that, unfortunately, because [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=887.12s)]
*  I know so many people who are sane and even very smart and even very well informed [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=895.52s)]
*  who believe there were irregularities, who believe there was something fishy about it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=900.4799999999999s)]
*  Because it really just speaks to the power of persistent propaganda and consistent lies and [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=904.4s)]
*  the beating of the drum continuously from the people in power and backed up by news networks [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=911.28s)]
*  and backed up by social media echo chambers where people just are not exposed to the truth. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=917.1999999999999s)]
*  And so they start to believe all they really hear. And they hear a bunch of complete lies with an [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=922.16s)]
*  entire media system, both conventional and new media that is just bombarding them with complete [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=927.68s)]
*  lies. And it becomes very hard for even rational people to see the truth. And that makes the problem [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=935.52s)]
*  a lot harder than sane versus not sane. It's just we just truly sadly live in this [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=940.88s)]
*  post-truth era now. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=946.32s)]
*  Yeah, no, I actually totally agree with you, Ben. So I'll retract that. Because it's so frustrating [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=947.28s)]
*  because it makes no rational sense. So I think how could any sane person think that all 61 court [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=956.32s)]
*  cases were somehow just all the Republicans in all those swing states that all of them lied [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=963.04s)]
*  because they were in on it with Hugo Chavez and whoever else was supposed to be part of that plot. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=970.08s)]
*  It's just so unbelievable. But you're right, people get, I mean, look, an enormous percentage [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=975.9200000000001s)]
*  of the country believed that Joe Biden was young and dynamic and was the best Democrat [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=982.64s)]
*  to take on Donald Trump and would easily beat Donald Trump despite all available evidence. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=987.5200000000001s)]
*  So propaganda, in a sense, propaganda is driving huge parts of this country insane. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=993.0400000000001s)]
*  As in not living in the rational world. And so these bubbles are super thick. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  But you're also right, we shouldn't blame the voters on either side. I know that MSNBC told [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  you that Joe Biden was young and that he had no mental problems. And they had a thousand excuses [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=1012.24s)]
*  to cover up his obvious problems like shaking hands with invisible people and not being able [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=1018.5600000000001s)]
*  to complete sentences, etc. And they got you to believe it. And for Trump, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=1024.32s)]
*  the right wing media lied so thoroughly. And then they had to pay 800, like Fox News had to pay [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=1030.0s)]
*  $800 million and admit that they were lying about the election. They admitted they were lying about [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=1035.04s)]
*  the election, but nevertheless, propaganda is the strongest drug on earth. So let's take on the [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=1040.72s)]
*  leaders like Trump and others. Let's take on the powerful. But for the voters, let's try to all [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=1047.28s)]
*  snap out of it, get out of our bubbles and try to join the rational sane world. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzzXe7QWT8&t=1054.32s)]
