"Popstar Chappell Roan, known for recent hits like "Pink Pony Club" and "Good Luck, Babe!" faced backlash from pro-family commentators after she suggested that all of her friends with young children are leading joyless lives.

On the "Call Her Daddy" podcast last week, Roan, was asked about still being close with friends in her Midwestern hometown, acknowledging they have "very different lives."

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Chappell Roan TRIGGERS Conservatives Over Comment About Parenting
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I)
*  But kids, all of my friends who have kids are in hell. I don't know anyone. I actually don't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=0.0s)]
*  know anyone who's happy and has children at this age. I have a one year old, three year old, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  four and under, five and under. I literally have not met anyone who's happy, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  anyone who has light in their eyes, anyone who has slept. They are so sweet and so supportive [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=19.6s)]
*  and come out to shows and they have to get babysitters to come to my shows. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=24.8s)]
*  Those comments from Chappellrone on the Call Her Daddy podcast has seemed to trigger quite a few [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=30.96s)]
*  conservatives on social media, which I just really don't know why. This is her perspective on how her [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=37.6s)]
*  own friends are feeling with very, very young children. Obviously, every child that she [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=45.44s)]
*  mentioned there is under the age of five. She talks about how miserable the parents are because [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=51.36s)]
*  yeah, they're gonna be exhausted. It's difficult to be a parent to a very young [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=55.44s)]
*  child or to a baby. But nonetheless, here are some of the reactions it spurred on X. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=59.2s)]
*  The Media Research Center, the account for it at least, says that Rhone, a Gen Z pop star who [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=65.44s)]
*  dresses in drag, claims all my friends who have kids are in hell. I don't know anyone who is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  happy with kids. Fact check, statistically, the happiest women in America are married and have [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=78.08s)]
*  children. We're gonna fact check that in just a minute, but it really does depend on the woman. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=83.52s)]
*  And it also depends on whether she thought it through before having kids or she's just kind [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=89.84s)]
*  of moving about the motions and doing what she's expected to do. We're gonna get to the research in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=94.72s)]
*  just a minute. But Charlie Kirk added some fashion policing to his comments as well, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=99.44s)]
*  saying that she is apparently famous, is a biological female who finds the need to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=104.32s)]
*  identify as a female but dresses in drag. Who cares, but okay. By the way, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=110.16s)]
*  haven't there been a long list of celebrities who, singers specifically, who have dressed in drag? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  And not only that, Rudy Giuliani dressed in drag and then Donald Trump put his face [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=120.72s)]
*  in his fake bosom. I didn't wanna remember that, but literally, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=126.64s)]
*  musical artists, in the 80s especially. Of course. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=131.76s)]
*  Like Boy George, right? Yeah, and if we're being honest, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=134.4s)]
*  a lot of those rock bands. Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=139.04s)]
*  What was with the eyeliner and the long hair and all that stuff? I mean, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=141.28s)]
*  it was literally called glam rock. That's right, Edwin just said it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=145.68s)]
*  But anyway, I'll continue. But she says all her friends with young kids are in hell. I don't know [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=148.72s)]
*  anyone who's happy with kids. You should not be surprised that a person as obviously deranged [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=153.68s)]
*  as Chappell Rhone with the types of friends she probably keeps would have such a dumb opinion. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Fact, the happiest women in America statistically are married with kids. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=165.36s)]
*  And then you have Civil Liberties lawyer Laura Powell who argues that it seems that way to her [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  because she mistakes self-indulgence for happiness. She only understands a shallow, fleeting sort of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  happiness. I don't know any childless people who seem truly happy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=186.56s)]
*  Wait, look, let me jump in here. So guys, you can tell who's unhappy by the ones that are trying to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=192.56s)]
*  police other people's conducts, okay? Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=200.4s)]
*  So I'm super happy with my kids. I don't go around yelling at other people, you have to have kids. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=203.28s)]
*  Okay, the people who do that are actually miserable. And that's why they're trying to get [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  misery loves company. They're like, you better have kids. You better be able to do the same thing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=213.04s)]
*  I'm going through, okay? Whereas I think like, hey, I love my kids and I think it would, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=217.6s)]
*  I wouldn't even say I recommend it because it depends on who you are. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=223.76s)]
*  Yeah, totally does. For some people, having children really gives them purpose in life. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=226.88s)]
*  I would never in a million years take that from them or question that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=232.16s)]
*  But everyone's different. To say that everyone's the same and if you have kids, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=236.24s)]
*  it's going to improve your life significantly is just incorrect. And by the way, the research [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=240.88s)]
*  bears that out and I want to get to that research. Real quick. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=247.2s)]
*  Yeah. Look, guys, by definition is wrong, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=249.6s)]
*  because humans are on a spectrum on almost everything. So some people love kids. My mom, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  oh my God, I probably got it from her. We both can't get enough of kids, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=258.56s)]
*  But I've seen many other people who were like, leave it or take it or leave it, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  And I've got friends who didn't have kids who were ecstatic, right? Why? Because we're different [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  people. So if you try to apply the same thing to my mom and to my friend who doesn't have kids, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=274.64s)]
*  of course, isn't one rule is not going to fit all. So anyone who's telling you one rule [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  is by definition wrong. So look, there have been many studies on this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=283.84s)]
*  So many studies, in fact, that there is a meta analysis where they look at all the different [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=288.08s)]
*  studies that have been put out in regard to happiness after having kids. And then they do [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=292.64s)]
*  the analysis, right? So let's take a look at this meta analysis and they find that the recent [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=296.8s)]
*  proliferation of studies examining cross national variation in the association between [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=301.6s)]
*  parenthood and happiness reveal accumulating evidence of lower levels of happiness among [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=306.48s)]
*  parents than non-parents in most advanced industrialized societies. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=311.44s)]
*  But conceptualizing parenting as a stressor buffered by institutional support, we hypothesize [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=318.0s)]
*  that parental status differences in happiness are smaller in countries providing more resources [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=326.08s)]
*  and support to families. Meaning living in a country that actually supports [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  couples who have kids or wanna have kids. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=338.08s)]
*  So our analysis of the European social surveys and international social survey program reveal [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=341.76s)]
*  considerable variation in the parenthood gap in happiness across countries with the United States [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  showing the largest disadvantage of parenthood is real hard to be a parent in America. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=354.16s)]
*  Let's keep going. We also find that more generous family policies, particularly paid time off and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=359.6s)]
*  childcare subsidies are associated with smaller disparities and happiness between parents [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=365.68s)]
*  and non-parents. Yeah, so look, the reason the right wing keeps pushing this [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=371.6s)]
*  is because they have a policy agenda. They want more kids and especially a certain kind of kids, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  right? So they're trying to get their side and they've seen the polling that if [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=381.68s)]
*  you're single and you're female, you're a thousand times more likely that's hyperbole, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=385.36s)]
*  but massively more likely to vote Democrat. So in their simple minds, they're thinking, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=390.72s)]
*  if we get them married and have kids, they will turn Republican. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=397.12s)]
*  No, you're confusing correlation with causation, right? And so they're not gonna magically become [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=400.32s)]
*  Republicans, but they want a baby factory and stuff. But you can't tell people in their [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=406.88s)]
*  personal lives what they should do based on your policy goals and politics, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=412.24s)]
*  That's silly. Don't listen to politicians telling you how many babies you should have. That's crazy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=418.08s)]
*  And by the way, the two are not mutually exclusive. You can both love the fact that you have kids, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=424.4s)]
*  happy with your decision to have kids, but also at least in the short term, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=428.96s)]
*  be really tired and miserable, cuz it's hard to raise kids. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=433.2s)]
*  Yeah, I actually think that you need to have a gene, which a lot of us have, right? It's in [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=436.32s)]
*  the human- I have many pairs. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  Right, but where you have this overwhelming love for your kids, otherwise it's too hard. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=443.36s)]
*  The hard part is baked in. You gotta change the diapers. You've gotta be responsible for them at [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  all times. You gotta make sure they're safe. You gotta take care of all their needs. That is [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=456.16s)]
*  super difficult. That's why we have the gene that makes us love our kids so much. But some folks [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=459.92s)]
*  have that gene a little less. And if you have it a little less or a lot less, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=465.52s)]
*  I wouldn't really recommend it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=469.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=471.12s)]
*  Right? So just know yourself. And the super last thing, right, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=471.44s)]
*  if you want more babies in America, at least pick the right policies. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=475.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=479.28s)]
*  Right? If you did it like Northern Europe and you had an actual social safety net, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  we would have the breathing room for paid family leave. We don't even give women any time off after [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=484.0s)]
*  they have a baby. Whereas all of the rest of the developed world has paid family leave. So when you [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  have a baby, you could spend at least 12 weeks with your baby. So do the right policies, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=493.92s)]
*  you'll get the right results anyway. Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=498.0s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnhYzYbA6I&t=501.28000000000003s)]
