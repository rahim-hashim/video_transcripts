"A right-wing comedian is blaming the ‚Äúwoke mind virus‚Äù after he was accused of sexual harassment and blacklisted from Fox News, he said Thursday.

Tyler Fischer, a frequent Gutfeld! guest who regularly appears on Fox, claims his only ‚Äúcrime‚Äù was asking a woman out for coffee. But Fox, which faced its own wave of #MeToo accusations in 2017, disagrees, and Fischer says he has been banned from the network‚Äôs New York studios over the suspicious interaction."

# Comedian BANNED From Fox News For Harassing Female Staff
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU)
*  Tonight's guest, he's got lots of voices in his head and zero choices in his bed, comedian Tyler Fisher. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=0.0s)]
*  She couldn't answer one question about what she would do differently than Biden. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=9.84s)]
*  She could have said, I won't fall off a bike. I won't fall up the stairs. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=13.84s)]
*  She could have said, I won't die as president. What a layup. I won't die. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=18.64s)]
*  He could be the first president to be assassinated by time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=22.8s)]
*  She'll be the first president to be assassinated by stupidity. Think of that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=26.56s)]
*  I mean, it was all fun and games. Frequent gut-filled guest comedian Tyler Fisher has [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=31.04s)]
*  been blacklisted now from coming on the show or any show on Fox for that matter. Why? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=37.6s)]
*  Because Fox apparently went full whoa. That's what he's saying. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=45.28s)]
*  Cenk, did you ever expect Fox News of all places to be described as woke? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  Well, look, when you go as right as you can on MAGA, nothing's gonna surprise you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=57.52s)]
*  I mean, one day they'll say, Trump is too woke, right? So, okay, but that's not the situation here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=63.84s)]
*  When I saw the headline that Fox is being accused of having the woke mind virus [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=70.56s)]
*  and banning this guy, I thought, uh-oh, what in the world did this guy do to make Fox News [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=76.88s)]
*  do that? It must have been pretty bad. So let's find out. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=83.6s)]
*  We'll see. How does it measure up to what we heard about O'Reilly? How is Fox woke? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=87.36s)]
*  Why did Fisher get banned? Well, according to Fisher, it's because he asked a Fox employee [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  out for coffee. On X, here's the statement. After almost two years, I will no longer be [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=99.6s)]
*  on Gut Fil, the TV show. Sadly, they have gone full woke and kicked me off for a reason that is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=106.0s)]
*  beyond hard to believe. What was my woke crime? I asked an employee out for coffee. Yes, that is why [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=111.76s)]
*  I'm off the show. I have proof of all of this and I'm seeking legal counsel for defamation because [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=118.32s)]
*  this is absolutely insane. It is not illegal or against any rules at Fox to ask a grown adult [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=124.16s)]
*  for coffee, but in the woke mind virus world, any advanced by man is labeled as some kind of toxic [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=129.52s)]
*  masculinity. This is why men have stopped approaching women in real life off dating [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=135.6s)]
*  apps because being chivalrous and doing what men have done forever, showing interest in women by [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=140.56s)]
*  offering to take them on a date is now turned into a crime. He's exploring his options. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=146.0s)]
*  But the flirty little interaction, as he put it with the Daily Mail, it's not as simple as that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=154.16s)]
*  According to a source with knowledge of the situation, Fisher grabbed the female employee's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=159.52s)]
*  cell phone, put his number in her contacts list, and then demanded to know if she got the number. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=165.52s)]
*  It wasn't a friendly thing, the source said. According to Fisher, after approaching the woman, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  he was accompanied by security to Gut Fil set for the show. Afterwards, he left and his [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  pre-arranged appearances were canceled. He says the show has ghosted him, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=184.48s)]
*  refused to have a conversation about any of this. They claim to hate wokeness, but it is all empty [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=190.0s)]
*  words. They won't back it up even for one of their top recurring guests. I've been on for nearly two [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  years without being paid a dime. They pay the rotating guests zero, even though we work our [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  asses off to prep for an episode. We work just as hard as Greg and the two regular guests who all [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  get paid. Fisher continued on this tirade. You are treated like an intern, not like a professional [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=214.16s)]
*  guest. We all travel, give up work to be there, write our own material, not to mention they will [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=220.72s)]
*  throw you under the bus and take the side of a woke, indoctrinated, radical feminist instead of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  their loyal guests. Now keep in mind, this man has only been on 16 episodes of the show since it [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=231.2s)]
*  launched in 2015, so do the math. As Greg likes to ask me every show, Tyler, what would Trump say [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=236.0s)]
*  about this? Well, he would say everything woke goes to S. That show had a lot of potential, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=243.28s)]
*  but with no spine or balls to back up the things they make fun of it. I will likely [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=249.84s)]
*  wither away over time. It will, the show, he's saying, will likely wither away over time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=258.08s)]
*  The ratings will drop just like CNN. That's probably the biggest insult. And it will fail, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=263.44s)]
*  sad he ends it as Trump would. I don't know where to start with this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=269.68s)]
*  Is Fox now woke after, what was it, 700 X amount million dollars, three quarters of a billion [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=277.76s)]
*  dollars and getting sued? And I mean, I know that was about fake news, but a lot came out of that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=283.76s)]
*  And all the other sexual harassment lawsuits, but I guess just where do we land on this one, Cenk? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=288.4s)]
*  Yeah, so look, there's a couple of things here. Things we know and things we don't know. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=295.52s)]
*  What actually happened in that interaction we don't know. Okay, so we'll let the court [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=300.48s)]
*  settle that if he really does sue them. So here's what I do know. Fox News does not have the woke [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=305.12s)]
*  mind virus, okay? And they're not like, let's find who of our guests we can cancel because [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=313.52s)]
*  they're too right wing. They wouldn't make anybody left in the building. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=321.68s)]
*  So that's not the right answer. So and that leads to a third thing I know. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=326.32s)]
*  Some folks on the right can't get it through their heads that the workplace is not like other places. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=333.76s)]
*  Okay, so when you go out to a bar and you wanna ask someone out, that's normal. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=340.56s)]
*  When you're in a workplace environment and you super aggressively ask out a woman, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=348.4s)]
*  that is an entirely different thing, right? Then there's enormous set of complications, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  right? Do you work there? And if you do work there, are you above her, below her? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=360.48s)]
*  Are you in her chain of command in a manner of speaking? Do you get to make decisions about her [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=364.88s)]
*  employment? Are you making her uncomfortable? How much so, etc. Is this a friendly interaction? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=371.2s)]
*  That's being misinterpreted or is it something where you're actually harassing her? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=377.52s)]
*  And so there's all of these things that go into it. And if you say no, there shouldn't be any rules [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=381.68s)]
*  like that at work. Come on, guys. You could argue, hey, I got some issues with some rules [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=385.84s)]
*  around the edges. Okay, that's a normal conversation. Where should we set the parameters, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=392.24s)]
*  right? But if you say no, we shouldn't have rules and guys should be able to go out and go, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=396.88s)]
*  all right, now if you don't go out with me, you're gonna get fired. No, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  we're not gonna go back to that. That's crazy talk, right? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=404.0s)]
*  So again, I can't guess at what happened in that particular incident. But the idea that Fox News [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=407.52s)]
*  was just too liberal seems less likely. Brian, what do you think? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=414.96s)]
*  Brian Fowler Well, look, I'm not a lawyer, but I play one on TV. And if I had been advising [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=419.04s)]
*  this fellow, I would have said, first, when you're speaking to the press, don't say that you [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  undertook a minor flirtation thing. The F word is never supposed to be used in the workplace post [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=435.11999999999995s)]
*  1991. Why? Because millions of women around America got together and marched and they said, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=445.2s)]
*  we don't like being objectified at work by dudes asking us out. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=456.56s)]
*  They don't, I don't even want you to compliment my outfit. I don't want you to tell me I'm pretty. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=463.28s)]
*  They said loud and clear. So HR departments around the country said, boom, no more. Can't say that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  Why? Because it makes us vulnerable legally and women don't like it and we're gonna advocate for [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=475.67999999999995s)]
*  them. And thus began an incredible wave of justice for women in the workplace. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=483.44s)]
*  And whether you agree with how it turned out or not, the rules are of the road are really clear [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=494.0s)]
*  now. And so as a fake attorney, I would just say to anyone who's undertaking any notion of flirting [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=499.44s)]
*  with an employee, a colleague, or just sidling up to the desk and sitting there and saying, hey, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=506.32s)]
*  give me your phone. I wanna give you my number. You can't do it now. You just can't. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=512.4s)]
*  And I always find it really funny. Guys hate being objectified. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=520.64s)]
*  A lot of guys hate gay guys because they think they're being objectified by gay guys. They hate [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=532.88s)]
*  the feeling of like, they're looking at me in the locker room and they're, I know that dude is into [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=538.08s)]
*  me just the way. And I've had this conversation with other men. Actually, a lot of guys aren't, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=546.24s)]
*  gay guys aren't looking at other guys at all like that. But your phobia of that being objectification, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=553.76s)]
*  that objectification is what women feel when they're at work and some dude is being a predator. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=560.0s)]
*  They don't like that either. So I try to explain this idea that it's just, just keep it to yourself. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=566.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=579.28s)]
*  It's impossible. And what you said resonated. I don't know, first of all, a woman who, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=580.08s)]
*  everybody I talked to, we don't even have to get deep. We both have the same story. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=586.88s)]
*  And those same guys who think every gay guy wants them, think every woman wants them. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=592.32s)]
*  Okay, there's the same mentality. And I gotta tell you, anytime I hear about something at Fox, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=596.96s)]
*  on my very first job, I happened to work with somebody who was already famous and then went [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=604.4s)]
*  on to Fox to become one of their biggest stars. And when he was accused of things later on and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=609.92s)]
*  the details leaked, this reporter knows it's true because I had it happen to me. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=616.96s)]
*  And it was disgusting and you feel powerless and people say, why don't you just report it? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=624.72s)]
*  Guess what? I worked hard. Just like you, just like a lot of people, we work hard. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=631.04s)]
*  It's not going to work out for us if we say something here. That's just the way it goes. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=636.8s)]
*  And so I don't know what happened with the comedian, Mr. Fisher. And like Cenk said, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=643.44s)]
*  maybe it'll be decided in the courts. Who knows? Maybe he'll do a skit about it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=651.28s)]
*  Maybe he'll go on the road with it. But if it went down the way this source, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=654.08s)]
*  sometimes very leery of these anonymous sources, don't touch my phone. Don't touch me or my [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=662.08s)]
*  phone and assume that I want your number, okay? Don't. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=669.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think in grabbing someone's phone and or, it's a violation of personal space. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  You're in my world. You're in my digital world. The rules of the road are always evolving, but [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=690.88s)]
*  it's still offensive. And I don't know what happened either. I don't know what the guy said [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  to her. I just think it's funny. He forgot. You're supposed to say all the misogynist stuff [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=705.04s)]
*  on TV. Not in the break room. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=710.8s)]
*  In character. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=713.5999999999999s)]
*  If it's on TV on Fox, it's cool. But if it's in the hallway or in the office, that's a no-no. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=715.04s)]
*  Yeah, but that goes to the last thing I was going to say. Look, guys, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  it's not that complicated a thing to realize there's a time and place for everything. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=727.68s)]
*  We used to know that, right? And so the place to objectify each other is at a bar. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=731.84s)]
*  In a club. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=737.84s)]
*  Right? Well, we do. We do. Men objectify women, women objectify men. Okay? And so there are [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=738.8s)]
*  plenty of places where that happens. But it's not in the workplace. And in the workplace, by the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=744.48s)]
*  way, there are sometimes complicated rules. So you can date someone in a different division, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=748.8s)]
*  but you can't do a date someone in the same division, etc., etc., right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=754.0s)]
*  So boo hoo. Yeah, there are rules in the world. Right? And sometimes, oh, well, I gotta figure [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=757.6s)]
*  out. Can I do that or can I not do that? And work is a very normal logical place where that happens. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=764.56s)]
*  Right? And so grownups adjust to that. And here, I'll give one last example from a [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=770.88s)]
*  guy's perspective. Brian used his perspective. I'll use my perspective. So- [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=776.08s)]
*  You know, if we were at a bar and somebody objectified me and said, hey, you know what? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=780.32s)]
*  You're too overweight. I don't wanna go out with you. Hey, that's life, brother. Okay? That's how [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=785.6s)]
*  it goes, right? But if you're at work and they're like, no, we don't wanna give you a promotion [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=790.4s)]
*  cuz you're too overweight. Wait, what? No, no, that's not how it works. Right? So like time and [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  place, not that complicated. But if you wanna be a victim, then you cry. And you say, oh, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=803.2s)]
*  I was just grabbing her phone. I mean, you guys are so right about the phone. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=809.36s)]
*  My contacts are in my phone. My pictures are in my phone. No, you don't get to hold my phone and [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=813.52s)]
*  do whatever you want with it, etc. Right? And if you can't understand these simple concepts, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=819.52s)]
*  then you're gonna run into trouble all the time in your life. Okay? That's just the reality. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=825.04s)]
*  But I've been lucky not to be objectified by anyone. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=831.6s)]
*  So what would I know? I don't believe that first. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=834.64s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=838.4s)]
*  Charmer. Sure, sure. But Brian, you also gave me an idea. Trump loves the fake news, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=840.96s)]
*  the fan. He's a fake populist and all that stuff. You should pitch him as his fake lawyer. He might [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  like it. I thought about that. And I thought about just as a side hustle, being one of his attorneys [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=851.84s)]
*  and just being the fake attorney that advises him. And just purely out of just selfish monetary [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=860.4s)]
*  gain. But I feel like I've learned enough on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia to advise him. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=868.0s)]
*  And that's how bad his lawyers are. That I feel empowered somehow that I could give him a few tips [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  here and there. Yeah. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=887.84s)]
*  And I think he'd take your advice. Yeah, no, he'd probably say, let Brian speak last. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=888.96s)]
*  Go for it. I mean, the guy with the tariffs, what is his name? He's a fraud. I mean, why not? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=894.72s)]
*  I'm a fraud. I could be a total fraud attorney. I think you've got, dude, I'm gonna go for it. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=901.6s)]
*  You're talking about Navarro. Yeah, Navarro. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=908.96s)]
*  Geez. Yeah, and he likes stars. He loves them. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=912.4s)]
*  That's right. Unless they shun him, then he hates them. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. I know I've gotta pursue this. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=922.0799999999999s)]
*  Now we're onto something here. We're onto something. Okay, we're gonna workshop it. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=928.0s)]
*  We'll get back to it. Okay, and by the way, guys, I should have told you this in the beginning of the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=932.64s)]
*  show. I should have told you several different times, but we're gonna announce something [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=939.2s)]
*  pretty dramatic next week. So buckle up for that. And if you made it all the way to the end of this [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=943.2s)]
*  bonus episode on a Friday night, then you get to be the ones to find out first. So something dramatic [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=949.2s)]
*  next week, a plan to maybe take over the Democratic Party. And how are we gonna do that? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=955.76s)]
*  Well, let's find out, isn't it? Okay. That's fun. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=961.84s)]
*  Yeah. How's that for a tease for whoever's left? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=966.08s)]
*  Anyways, all right, much love. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5oh0MA-lCU&t=969.2s)]
