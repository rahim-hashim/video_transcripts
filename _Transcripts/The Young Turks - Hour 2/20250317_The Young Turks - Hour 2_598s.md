# Trump Just Dismantled These 7 "Unnecessary" Federal Agencies
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k)
*  Trump's purge of the government continues, this time dismantling seven federal agencies [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=0.0s)]
*  that he has deemed yet again unnecessary. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=6.34s)]
*  So who did Trump go after this time? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  The president targeted the US Agency for Global Media, which is the parent company of Voice [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=13.22s)]
*  of America, as well as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=18.06s)]
*  Institution and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, an agency that supports [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=24.14s)]
*  libraries, archives and museums in every state. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=30.28s)]
*  He also dismantled the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, which aims to prevent [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=34.18s)]
*  and end homelessness in the US. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=41.86s)]
*  The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, an agency focused on preventing, minimizing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  and resolving work stoppages and labor disputes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=50.64s)]
*  The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which aims to expand economic opportunity [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=54.52s)]
*  for underserved communities and the Minority Business Development Agency, which promotes [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=61.28s)]
*  growth of minority-owned businesses. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=66.22s)]
*  In the executive order signed on Friday, Trump told the heads of all seven agencies to eliminate [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=69.44s)]
*  all functions except the bare minimum. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=75.22s)]
*  He directed the government entities to be eliminated to the maximum extent consistent [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=78.8s)]
*  with applicable law, insisting they, quote, reduce the performance of their statutory [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=84.0s)]
*  functions and associated personnel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=89.38s)]
*  It ordered the heads of each entity to submit a report to the Office of Management and Budget, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=92.32s)]
*  confirming full compliance within seven days. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=97.28s)]
*  The fact these agencies are enshrined in law and can't be fully eliminated shows just how [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump is trying to push the limit with his executive power. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Voice of America's parent, the US Agency for Global Media, for example, is congressionally [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  chartered as an independent agency. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=116.76s)]
*  And Congress passed a law in 2020 intended to limit the power of the agency's presidentially [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  appointed chief executive. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=125.5s)]
*  The director of Voice of America, Michael Abrahamovitz, wrote in a post on social media [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=128.0s)]
*  that virtually the entire staff had been put on administrative leave, including him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=134.64s)]
*  By Saturday morning, many journalists and other employees at Voice of America were informed [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=140.44s)]
*  they were being placed on administrative leave, according to an email reviewed by the New [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=145.56s)]
*  York Times. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=149.32s)]
*  Journalists there said the cuts were so widespread that they would effectively shut down the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=151.04s)]
*  international broadcaster. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=154.92s)]
*  In a statement to USA Today, Caroline Levitt stated, President Trump is delivering on his [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  promise to make our government more efficient. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=162.84s)]
*  American taxpayers should not be funding anti-American propaganda in the name of journalism. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=166.0s)]
*  But here's the kicker. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=171.96s)]
*  Amid questions over the future of BOA, Trump had picked former Arizona gubernatorial and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Senate candidate Kerry Lake to lead the outlet. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=179.04s)]
*  The Trump ally said at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month that the international [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=182.52s)]
*  state media broadcaster won't be, quote, Trump TV under her watch. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=188.4s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=194.04s)]
*  While the president doesn't directly appoint the head of the VOA, Trump had nominated conservative [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  activist L. Brent Boazel III to lead the US Agency for Global Media, which would make [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=199.88s)]
*  the decision. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=206.16s)]
*  Boazel needs to be confirmed by the Senate to take his post and could then select Lake. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=207.16s)]
*  critical of him are out and those who are in favor of him stay in. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=214.32s)]
*  Boaz, there are a lot of different things in the chopping block here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  Are there any that stand out to you? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=224.0s)]
*  How do you feel about these cuts overall? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=225.76s)]
*  I think they all kind of align with what seems to be the Trump strategy of cutting these [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  that he can make a credible to him and his team's argument that these are entities that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=238.28s)]
*  just don't serve the American interests, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=247.24s)]
*  And they do it to things that are just broadly unpopular with the public. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=252.12s)]
*  USAID, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=257.16s)]
*  Without getting into the nitty gritty of what they do abroad, just the idea that America [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=260.12s)]
*  would be shipping funds to foreigners for aid is unpopular. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=266.08s)]
*  If you ask the normal person, should we be giving a bunch of aid to these other countries? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=271.84s)]
*  Most people would be like, no, we should be spending it here to help the people here in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=277.08s)]
*  need, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=281.28s)]
*  And I think something like, basically a global media organization where we know the media [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=282.56s)]
*  broadly just is kind of unpopular with the average American. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=288.48s)]
*  I think this is the same sleight of hand that they're doing here where his press secretary [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  could come out and be like, you guys know that the press is generally sucks and is lib [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=300.44s)]
*  nonsense and they're anti-American and we could cut it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=306.84s)]
*  I think all of this stuff sort of plays into that narrative that they've tried to form [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  around a lot of the cuts, at least publicly. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the way the Voice of America cuts specifically are being framed, I think, is quite funny. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=320.67999999999995s)]
*  So Caroline Levitt said that we shouldn't be funding anti-American propaganda in the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=327.23999999999995s)]
*  name of journalism. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=333.23999999999995s)]
*  Now, Voice of America is somewhat similar to NPR that is just mostly straight down the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  middle and that they will report and at times that is unflattering for Trump, but they will [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  report what is happening. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=349.64s)]
*  Trump doesn't like that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=352.52s)]
*  That's why he's upset with major broadcasters. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=353.8s)]
*  That's why he's upset with legacy newspapers and other media institutions. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  If they portray what's happening as fact and not spinning it on his behalf, that's fake [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=362.2s)]
*  news to him. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=369.08s)]
*  That's old, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=370.28s)]
*  But to the rest of the world, and throughout parts of the world where VOA also broadcasts [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=372.68s)]
*  they see it as pro-American propaganda. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=379.88s)]
*  VOA has its roots in the Cold War as a way to push American propaganda to the farthest [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=383.64s)]
*  corners of the planet. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=392.28s)]
*  So with that in mind and seeing it like USAID and people had the same reaction from the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=394.68s)]
*  left to USAID cuts, like yes, of course, the humanitarian work is important, but the strings [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=400.12s)]
*  attached to some of the aid that USAID delivers plays a role in the soft power of the United [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=406.52s)]
*  States in that companies or countries that they help have to also position themselves [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  in alignment with the US's interests. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=423.64s)]
*  VOA is more soft power for the US and I don't necessarily feel that bad about losing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=426.52s)]
*  VOA. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=436.44s)]
*  It's just it's another mechanism for US soft power and propaganda. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=437.0s)]
*  Am I off here? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=441.4s)]
*  No, I don't think you're off and that's why I think it's so hard to properly convey to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=443.08s)]
*  people what they quote unquote should or shouldn't care about or more importantly, the people in [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=450.76s)]
*  power, the Democrats, please don't show up to a press conference or some kind of rally [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=457.08s)]
*  and start crying for the VOA. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=464.92s)]
*  It's not that the VOA is a wholly unworthy cause. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  It's just like there are more important things to be publicly taking the fight to Trump on. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=471.0s)]
*  I want to address something you said about US soft power that I think folks need to understand [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=479.32s)]
*  that the soft power rarely ever stays soft because the second that these places abroad, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  their regimes aren't doing what we kind of like. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=493.72s)]
*  The sort of counter insurgencies, the guys that do the hard power stuff end up being the people [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=499.56s)]
*  that the soft power starts to support. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=506.44000000000005s)]
*  And so that soft power becomes very warlike pretty quickly. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=511.32000000000005s)]
*  The second that these countries and their regimes aren't aligning with the State Department [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=516.9200000000001s)]
*  and the CIA and all these various other geopolitical entities. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=523.24s)]
*  I'm 100% in alignment with you, Jordan, in the sense that this stuff, generally speaking, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=532.44s)]
*  we publicize the Ebola sort of control and giving people AIDS medicine and we do that stuff. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fToJdZL6k&t=540.2s)]
