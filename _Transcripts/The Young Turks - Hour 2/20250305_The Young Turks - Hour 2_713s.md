"WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Donald Trump is granting a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers, as worries persist that the newly launched trade war could crush domestic manufacturing.

The pause comes after Trump spoke with leaders of the ‚Äúbig 3‚Äù automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, on Wednesday, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt."

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Trump's Tariffs MESS Gets WAY Worse
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE)
*  Let me ask you this, okay? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=0.0s)]
*  How many Dodge Rams do you see [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=1.28s)]
*  driving around Europe, okay? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=3.36s)]
*  How many Dodge Rams do you see [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=5.72s)]
*  driving around India? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=7.88s)]
*  I mean, not many, I bet. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=10.28s)]
*  Why? Because they don't buy [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=11.96s)]
*  our cars. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=13.22s)]
*  And that's what President Trump is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=14.02s)]
*  trying to change. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=15.92s)]
*  Maybe Dodge should start building [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=16.92s)]
*  them here and selling them here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=18.88s)]
*  All right, well, Fox Business host [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=23.88s)]
*  Maria Bartiromo has some very [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=26.28s)]
*  strong thoughts for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=28.04s)]
*  Dodge after Fox Business reporter [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=29.32s)]
*  decided to interview a dealership [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=31.72s)]
*  owner who said that the tariffs [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=34.16s)]
*  that Trump has implemented would [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=36.24s)]
*  absolutely raise prices in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=38.44s)]
*  the United States. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=40.36s)]
*  And today, looks like Trump was [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=41.72s)]
*  willing to do a little peace [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=44.04s)]
*  agreement with two of the countries [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=46.04s)]
*  that he slapped with tariffs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=48.44s)]
*  We're going to give you the details [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=50.92s)]
*  on that in just a minute. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=52.44s)]
*  But before we get to that, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  let's see what the dealership owner [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=55.28s)]
*  has to say that riled Bartiromo up [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=57.48s)]
*  so much. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=59.48s)]
*  Some of them are made in Michigan, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=61.4s)]
*  some are made in Mexico. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=63.48s)]
*  Those are going to get a whole lot [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=65.24s)]
*  more expensive going forward. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=66.92s)]
*  And it's not just the trucks and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=68.8s)]
*  the vehicles that are made in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=70.56s)]
*  Mexico, but all of the parts that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=72.12s)]
*  come from Mexico and Canada and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=74.0s)]
*  going back and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  forth across the border. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=76.6s)]
*  David Kelleher is David Otto, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=78.36s)]
*  Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  Impact. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=82.44s)]
*  Dramatic, dramatic. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  I sold order for a customer, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=85.8s)]
*  $80,000 truck, it's $100,000 now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  So he's not going to buy [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=91.16s)]
*  the truck. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=92.64s)]
*  It's going to sit on my lot, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=94.32s)]
*  and the higher interest rates we're [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  paying right now for floor plan. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  And nobody's going to buy [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=99.96s)]
*  the truck because it just had [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  a $20,000 price increase. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=102.56s)]
*  Right, Kelly Blue Book will put [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  the number up. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  They say the average vehicle will [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=106.56s)]
*  go up by about $3,000. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=108.44s)]
*  Does it sound right to you? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=109.84s)]
*  No, we don't have the broad stroke. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=111.8s)]
*  We don't have the linear, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=115.08s)]
*  the tight strokes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=116.88s)]
*  But to me, it's a 25% in tariff. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=118.0s)]
*  So that affects our parts that come [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  from over these countries and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  a whole bunch of our cars. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, Trump implemented [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=132.2s)]
*  25% tariffs on all imports from [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=134.88s)]
*  Canada and Mexico, with the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=137.48s)]
*  exception of oil, we obviously [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  rely on Canada for our oil needs. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=142.48s)]
*  And so he's like, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  10% tariff on Canadian oil, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=146.56s)]
*  But everything else, 25% tariff. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=149.64s)]
*  Obviously, that is going to lead [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  to price increases because the car [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=155.2s)]
*  companies aren't going to absorb [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  the added costs of the tariffs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=160.6s)]
*  They're going to pass that on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=163.0s)]
*  to consumers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=164.48s)]
*  Now in some cases, they might divvy [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=165.2s)]
*  up the inflated costs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=167.2s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=168.8s)]
*  your prices are going to go up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=170.56s)]
*  Why is Maria Bartiromo pretending [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=172.56s)]
*  to be surprised by this, John? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=174.52s)]
*  Because her job is to both protect [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=177.0s)]
*  markets, but also Fox and Trump. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=179.64s)]
*  So if she's protecting [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=183.72s)]
*  the markets, then she should be [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=184.52s)]
*  more critical of this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=185.56s)]
*  But if she attacks Trump and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=186.48s)]
*  his policy, then she'll probably be [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=187.68s)]
*  fired. And so she's sort of caught [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  between a rock and a dumb place. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=190.84s)]
*  She kind of has to oppose this and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=193.76s)]
*  say a lot of stupid stuff. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=195.56s)]
*  I love her point that how many [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=198.0s)]
*  dodges do you see in India? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  Not a lot, I bet, because she [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=202.04s)]
*  doesn't know and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=203.56s)]
*  she didn't look into it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  But I agree with her, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=205.64s)]
*  there probably aren't a lot. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=206.64s)]
*  But maybe she could think for [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  a second why that is. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=209.6s)]
*  Maybe it's not just hatred or [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  whatever. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=212.64s)]
*  Maybe we don't make cars that are [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  appealing to other people around [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=215.16s)]
*  the world because they have [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=217.04s)]
*  different safety standards, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=218.6s)]
*  different emission standards. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=220.28s)]
*  Maybe we make them mostly for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=222.16s)]
*  looks and way oversized and also [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=223.72s)]
*  too expensive when they value more [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  economical cars. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  These are the sorts of things that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=229.6s)]
*  on a business network you'd [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=231.04s)]
*  probably want to talk about. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  But I don't have the tight strokes [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=233.27999999999997s)]
*  of that to necessarily say. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=234.88s)]
*  But anyway- [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=236.27999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, let me jump in real quick [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  and hold that thought. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=238.44s)]
*  Because in the case of India, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=239.44s)]
*  it is true that they have imposed [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=241.48s)]
*  very, very high tariffs in regard [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=243.72s)]
*  to American cars being imported in. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  So yeah, in some cases, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=248.88s)]
*  countries do have high tariffs. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  But what ends up happening is if [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  the price of the American vehicles [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=254.08s)]
*  that are being imported end up [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=256.16s)]
*  being too expensive, people aren't [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  going to buy the American cars. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=259.88s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  So in this case, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=262.04s)]
*  you have American car companies [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=263.12s)]
*  relying on foreign countries for [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=265.36s)]
*  parts or even manufacturing the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  American cars in foreign countries. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=270.2s)]
*  And so you have a situation in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=272.76s)]
*  which American cars end up being [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  too costly for Americans to buy [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=276.24s)]
*  because of how the system works and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=277.92s)]
*  because of the tariffs that Trump [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=279.88s)]
*  theoretically is implementing, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=281.72s)]
*  so I'll explain why in a minute. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=283.56s)]
*  Yeah, the only other thing I want [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  to add is something that I brought [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  up on my show, which I haven't [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=287.84s)]
*  seen Business at Works talk about. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  And I don't think that you will [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=290.76s)]
*  because it concerns a topic that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  they're supposed to pretend not to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=293.32s)]
*  be aware of, which is you rightly [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  point out the various reasons why [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=296.4s)]
*  necessarily prices will go up by [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  some amount. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=299.68s)]
*  But I want everyone to remember [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=300.44s)]
*  that that is not the only thing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=302.28s)]
*  that will lead to higher prices. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  In an environment where there's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=305.96s)]
*  this economic chaos, where [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=307.96s)]
*  everybody knows that prices are [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  going up, and you're going to be [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=311.64s)]
*  like, what's going to go up? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=313.44s)]
*  What do corporations do? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=315.04s)]
*  They raise them whether they have [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=316.16s)]
*  to or not because they can, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=317.76s)]
*  they price gouge. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=319.04s)]
*  And again, they're not going to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=319.88s)]
*  talk about that in the news, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=320.92s)]
*  you don't talk about price gouging. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=321.92s)]
*  But they will definitely do that, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=323.12s)]
*  even for product categories that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=324.56s)]
*  are not facing tariffs, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=325.96s)]
*  they're going to raise their prices. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=327.08s)]
*  And so Trump is providing the cover [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=329.04s)]
*  for them to do that across [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=330.76s)]
*  the entire economy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=332.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, we definitely [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  did see that after we had supply [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=335.2s)]
*  chain issues, which, of course, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=336.96s)]
*  impacted certain products. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=338.96s)]
*  And then you would listen to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=340.84s)]
*  the quarterly shareholder calls, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=342.24s)]
*  and company executives were like, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=344.32s)]
*  this inflationary environment has [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=346.68s)]
*  been very profitable for us. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  So they're just so brazen about it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=351.12s)]
*  And if you really want to know what [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=354.08s)]
*  corporations and companies are up [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=355.92s)]
*  to, listen in on those investor [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=357.92s)]
*  calls because they have to be [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  honest. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  Defrauding your investors is one of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  the few things that will get [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=365.68s)]
*  executives into a lot of trouble in [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=367.24s)]
*  this country. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=369.2s)]
*  Stealing from the rich, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=370.56s)]
*  what's the good idea? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=371.8s)]
*  Stealing from the poor, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=372.72s)]
*  totally okay, based on how things [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=373.88s)]
*  usually turn out. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=375.64s)]
*  Now, let's talk a little bit about [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=376.92s)]
*  what happened in the aftermath of [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=379.8s)]
*  the stock market kind of tanking [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=382.72s)]
*  after Trump had imposed his 25% [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=385.44s)]
*  tariffs against Canada and Mexico. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=388.2s)]
*  So apparently now, Trump has [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=391.12s)]
*  announced an exemption specifically [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=393.92s)]
*  for automobile imports. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=397.32s)]
*  But specifically for now, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=400.24s)]
*  things are subject to change. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=402.44s)]
*  And who doesn't love uncertainty? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=404.72s)]
*  Now, the president's decision [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=407.64s)]
*  followed a telephone conversation [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=409.6s)]
*  with executives from the big three [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=411.8s)]
*  automakers that includes General [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=413.92s)]
*  Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=415.96s)]
*  who sought relief from the new [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=417.96s)]
*  import taxes. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=419.8s)]
*  Now, there are some terms that you [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=421.44s)]
*  should know about here, automakers [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=423.52s)]
*  who specifically comply with the US [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=426.16s)]
*  MCA or the United States, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=428.56s)]
*  Mexico Canada agreement, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=430.4s)]
*  which was a trade deal negotiated [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=432.24s)]
*  by Trump's first administration, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=434.44s)]
*  will be eligible for this exemption. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  US MCA was the successor to NAFTA, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=439.0s)]
*  among other provisions. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=441.4s)]
*  It increased the amount of North [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=443.24s)]
*  American parts required in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=445.44s)]
*  each automobile. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=447.32s)]
*  It also required that any steel or [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=448.56s)]
*  aluminum used to make the cars must [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=450.68s)]
*  be purchased within the continent. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=452.96s)]
*  Now, the catch with Trump's [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=455.76s)]
*  decision is that it will only last [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=457.8s)]
*  for one month. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=460.0s)]
*  So it's really exciting that we get [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=461.12s)]
*  to revisit this probably every [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=463.52s)]
*  month moving forward for [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=465.48s)]
*  the remainder of Trump's term. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=467.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, we've all really enjoyed [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  debt ceiling negotiations. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=471.8s)]
*  So we need to have a couple more [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=473.8s)]
*  things so that there's always some [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=475.64s)]
*  chaos hanging over our heads. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=477.88s)]
*  It's just, this is how every bit of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=479.76s)]
*  this presidency has gone. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  Do wild things then realize, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=483.52s)]
*  actually that might be a terrible [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=485.36s)]
*  idea and also unpopular. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=487.28s)]
*  So I guess I'll back off but [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=488.84s)]
*  I'll probably do it again. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  So the market doesn't even really [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=491.08s)]

*  And then as in the case, remember, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=493.84s)]
*  you're describing now the carve out [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=495.23999999999995s)]
*  for the auto manufacturers. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  That's for, I think, for [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  three companies he specifically [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=498.71999999999997s)]

*  There's still so [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=500.96s)]
*  many product categories that are [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=501.84s)]
*  receiving that tariff. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=503.52s)]
*  And so we have chaos potentially to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=504.79999999999995s)]
*  come for that and then already [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=506.88s)]

*  our economy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  It's a terrible time to be [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=512.36s)]
*  a consumer and it's also a terrible [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  time to be a business. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=515.0s)]
*  In fact, let me double down on what [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=516.72s)]
*  you're saying because Trump [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=518.84s)]
*  implemented a lower tariff when it [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  comes to Canadian oil. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=523.2s)]
*  Instead of 25%, it's a 10% tariff. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=525.0s)]
*  It's still a 10% tariff and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=527.96s)]
*  we really do rely on Canadian oil [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=530.32s)]
*  in this country. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=533.24s)]
*  Now some might argue why? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=535.0400000000001s)]
*  Why are we importing Canadian oil [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=536.84s)]
*  when we are the top oil producer in [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=539.1600000000001s)]
*  the world and we also happen to be [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=541.6400000000001s)]
*  the top oil exporter in the world? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=544.16s)]
*  Well, it's because our oil [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=546.76s)]
*  refineries are unable to refine [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=548.88s)]
*  the oil that our oil companies are [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=551.28s)]
*  drilling for in this country. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=553.8s)]
*  And so we rely on Canadian oil [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=556.16s)]
*  because our refineries for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=558.04s)]
*  whatever reason are able to refine [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=559.72s)]
*  that oil. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=561.84s)]
*  So I interviewed someone who works [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=563.28s)]
*  in the oil industry. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=565.28s)]
*  This was not something I did as [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=566.2s)]
*  part of a story or anything. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=568.08s)]
*  I did it for my own information and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=569.8s)]
*  he was explaining to me that [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=571.8s)]
*  part of the reason why they [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=573.68s)]
*  haven't built new oil refineries [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=575.16s)]
*  to refine American oil is because [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=577.24s)]
*  it would, well, cost money and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  that would lower the return on [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  investment for shareholders. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=583.12s)]
*  So kind of a disaster. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=585.12s)]
*  So when you have a 10% tariff on [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=587.48s)]
*  Canadian oil, that's going to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=589.8s)]
*  impact the price of literally [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=592.04s)]
*  everything because you need energy, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=594.24s)]
*  right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=597.04s)]
*  You need gas, for instance, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=597.6s)]
*  to transport goods. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=599.84s)]
*  And if gas is going to cost more [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=601.76s)]
*  money and it's going to cost more [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=603.56s)]
*  money to transport goods, yeah, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=605.36s)]
*  the prices are going to go up for [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  everything. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=609.04s)]
*  So that's something to keep in [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=610.76s)]
*  mind moving forward. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=611.96s)]
*  Now, even though there is [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=612.84s)]
*  instability as a result of Trump [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=614.56s)]
*  revisiting this tariff situation [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=616.76s)]
*  every month now, it looks like [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=619.12s)]
*  the markets reacted to the latest [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=621.36s)]
*  news favorably. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=623.68s)]
*  The Dow Jones Industrial Average [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=625.16s)]
*  climbed about 550 points or 1.3%, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=627.64s)]
*  while the S&P 500 jumped 1.25%. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=630.88s)]
*  The tech heavy NASDAQ increased 1.5% [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=634.4s)]
*  on Wednesday. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=637.08s)]
*  So if you were smart enough to buy [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=638.4s)]
*  the dip, you're probably very [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=640.36s)]
*  happy now. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=642.24s)]
*  If you didn't buy the dip, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=643.28s)]
*  don't worry, you'll probably have [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=644.6s)]
*  another opportunity next month. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=646.4s)]
*  Yep, and I'm sure all of Trump's [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=648.36s)]

*  about this is Trump is still [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=667.32s)]
*  insisting that Trudeau is not [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=668.62s)]

*  He says, Trudeau called me to ask [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=675.36s)]
*  what could be done about tariffs. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9f25DvH2jE&t=677.5200000000001s)]
