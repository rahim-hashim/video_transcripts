"A recent YouGov poll found that President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration deporting migrants to El Salvador without due process is widely unpopular.

The poll conducted between March 28 and April 1 asked 1095 U.S. adult citizens if they support or oppose the following statement: ‚ÄúDeporting immigrants without criminal convictions to El Salvador to be imprisoned, without letting them challenge the deportation in court."

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Marco Rubio Plays THOUGHT-POLICE On Behalf Of Israel
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg)
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio wants to make sure that no one who has criticized Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=0.0s)]
*  or the United States gets a visa to come to the United States. And at least one foreign citizen [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=7.44s)]
*  seems to have been denied entry to the US thanks to his efforts. Now here's what you need to know, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=14.0s)]
*  Rubio has instructed the United States diplomats to essentially dig through the social media. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=20.56s)]
*  This is amazing, the social media profiles of visa applicants, specifically student visas and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=26.799999999999997s)]
*  exchange visitor visas to make sure they haven't committed any thought crimes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=34.4s)]
*  Because here in the United States, we all really wanna be known for fostering the type of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  government that punishes you for thinking the wrong way. So Rubio has instructed them to do this, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=45.92s)]
*  his instructions were conveyed through a long cable. The cable specifies a type of applicant [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=55.6s)]
*  whose social media posts should be scrutinized. Someone who is suspected of having terrorist [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  ties or sympathies. Obviously, we don't want to allow someone who has terrorist ties into [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=66.88s)]
*  the country. So I don't have a problem with that. What I do have a problem with though, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=72.0s)]
*  is what passes as someone who has terrorist sympathies. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=76.0s)]
*  So if you care about the well-being of the Palestinian people, meaning the civilians, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=80.88s)]
*  well, Israel certainly thinks that you have terrorist sympathies. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=88.0s)]
*  And Israel calls the shots when it comes to this, when it comes to our government and how they act [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=91.92s)]
*  on this. So our government's just going to go along with what Israel wants. So if you think [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=96.56s)]
*  Palestinian civilians are human beings who should not be ethnically cleansed, who should not lose [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  every single family member through US bombs that are being dropped on their heads by the Israeli [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=110.32s)]
*  government. Well, then you have terrorist sympathies, I guess. But let me continue with [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  the rest of that. So who had a student or exchange visa between October 7th, 2023 and August 31st, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=122.24s)]
*  2024, or who has had a visa terminated since that October date. The cable also states that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=130.0s)]
*  applicants can be denied a visa if their behavior or actions show they bear a hostile attitude [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=136.48s)]
*  toward US citizens or US culture, including government institutions and founding principles. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=142.16s)]
*  Go ahead, John. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=149.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think the interesting thing about that is if we're gonna start rejecting people from [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  being inside of the US because they're hostile to our culture or history, our government. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=154.32s)]
*  Elon, get the hell out of here. Is there anyone more hostile to our government, our culture? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  The Republicans in general, they don't want you to know anything about our history. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=164.96s)]
*  That's our cultural DNA. That's who we are. And they want you to be ignorant of it. They hide it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=168.56s)]
*  They ban their books. They're incredibly hostile towards all of this. And so if this is the new [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=173.68s)]
*  standard, then I think we're gonna have to be way more restrictive towards a whole bunch of them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=178.56s)]
*  Yeah, and look, this is something that will likely still be supported by most, I think, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=181.52s)]
*  most Trump supporters because they're going to miss the forest for the trees, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=188.24s)]
*  They're gonna think of this as just an immigration policy, an anti-immigration policy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  But it's not just about where you land or what you think about immigration. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=198.55999999999997s)]
*  This is about punishing people specifically based on their views of how Israel is prosecuting that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  war in Israel. On a tweet. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=211.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you- That's all it is. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  And really, we're gonna have US ambassadors scour social media accounts to make sure [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=214.32s)]
*  that the visa applicants are adequately pro-Israel. What? I think that's crazy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=219.92s)]
*  So per the report, Rubio is hoping that thanks to this new procedure, foreign citizens who are [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=226.48s)]
*  critical of Israel or Israeli policy will simply give up on applying for visas. Look, I love how [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  every report on this is like anyone who's critical of Israel and the United States. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=239.04s)]
*  No, it's not about the United States. They don't care about visa applicants being critical of the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=243.6s)]
*  United States. This is a new policy that has been formed specifically on behalf of the Israeli [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=247.76s)]
*  government, which doesn't like to get its feelings hurt when anyone calls them out for doing what [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=253.28s)]
*  they're obviously doing and bragging about what they're doing. Literally, okay, they announce [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=257.52s)]
*  what they're doing. But nonetheless, don't criticize them. Do not criticize them. Just shut up [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  or else you're gonna be punished in some way by our government. You're gonna have your visa [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=268.8s)]
*  denied. And by the way, at least one foreign citizen has been denied a visa seemingly because [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=274.16s)]
*  of Rubio's instructions. On Tuesday, the former president of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias, told [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=279.92s)]
*  reporters that the United States government had sent him an email saying it was suspending a visa [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=285.92s)]
*  in his passport that had been allowed or had allowed him to enter the United States. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  Weeks ago, he said on social media that Trump was behaving like a Roman emperor. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=298.24s)]
*  Well, at least in this case, he was punished for criticizing Trump. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=303.84s)]
*  I guess. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  Criticizing Trump and not Israel. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=308.08s)]
*  Yeah. First of all, I love that this guy gets criticized for comparing him to a Roman empire. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=309.76s)]
*  Trump's gonna tweet out a picture of him as a Roman empire, literally later today. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  I think that NFT might already exist. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=319.28s)]
*  It probably does. Roman Empire is nicer than nine out of 10 things MAGA people [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  reference Donald Trump as being. This is so pathetic. My God. And by the way, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=325.67999999999995s)]
*  your social media activity is now being used to justify more and more. And it might be easy for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=330.4s)]
*  MAGA people to be like, well, I don't care if it denies you a student visa. First of all, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=334.4s)]
*  they're foreigners, so screw them. Second of all, it's a student thing. I'd never want that anyway. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=339.28s)]
*  But look at the deportations based on what brand of clothing you wear or what tattoo you have. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=343.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=350.96s)]
*  Dangerous stuff like Jordan dunking or a crown or a star or whatever. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=351.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=356.4s)]
*  This is the issue when you allow this sort of meddling and little searching and censorship to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=356.88s)]
*  start to spread. You might have something that sounds like it's concrete, like you have anti-US [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=363.04s)]
*  sentiment or whatever. That's not at all. That's not concrete at all, I should say. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=369.76s)]
*  It's based on how sensitive the person doing the evaluating is. And unfortunately, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=373.68s)]
*  we are finding out more and more there ain't a snowflake more sensitive and easily triggered [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=379.2s)]
*  than most Republicans these days. Okay, to me, I think of them as being, and I think this is the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=384.32s)]
*  season for it, holiday-wise. They're basically like chocolate Easter rabbits. They look solid, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=390.24s)]
*  but you just play a little bit of pressure and it just crumbles. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  It's so thin, it's really unsatisfying in the end, and that's what they are. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=399.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=403.12s)]
*  Marco Rubio gets triggered by literally anything. You do a tweet, the grad student. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=403.76s)]
*  Listen. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=408.8s)]
*  She did a panel presentation or something and she sent off to Louisiana. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=409.12s)]
*  These people are pathetic. You can't criticize America or Israel or remake Snow White without [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=415.04s)]
*  them just falling into a little puddle. It's pathetic. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=421.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, there aren't a lot of lint chocolate Easter bunnies in the White House. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=425.68s)]
*  I will admit that. No, but in all seriousness, Marco Rubio, just think about who Marco Rubio [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=432.64s)]
*  really is and how much he's on edge, right? I can understand why he doesn't want to deal [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=439.20000000000005s)]
*  with any feedback or criticism. He's on edge. I mean, look, at the end of the day, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  homeboys in Neocon, and he also loves neoliberal economic policies. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  And I paid close attention to Marco Rubio's face today as Trump was announcing his tariffs. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=458.8s)]
*  Marco Rubio is no fan of tariffs. Again, he's a neoliberal. Neoliberals are not fans of tariffs, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=459.6s)]
*  right? So it's just, I'm kind of enjoying that. That's where I find a little bit of solace. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=464.16s)]
*  You made a deal with the devil. Yeah, the turmoil, exactly. Yeah, but just quickly getting back to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  this, you had referenced some of the people who have been deported. But in regard to the issue of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=475.04s)]
*  Israel and the criticism of Israel, there have been students, now a number of them that we've [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=482.0s)]
*  reported on in great detail, who have been arrested, rounded up, disappeared for a brief [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=487.44s)]
*  period of time to the point where their own lawyers couldn't find them. But the first person, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=491.92s)]
*  of course, was Mahmoud Khalil. And we've gotten a little bit of an update on him. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=497.44s)]
*  He's currently in Jenna, Louisiana. He had not engaged in any type of harassment of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=502.64s)]
*  Jewish students. There's no indication that he's supportive of any terrorist group or [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=507.44s)]
*  even supportive of Hamas. He just made the mistake of being critical of how Israel is [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=512.4s)]
*  prosecuting this war. And according to lawyers and rights activists, he was sent to this [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=518.48s)]
*  detention facility. It's an immigration detention facility in Louisiana. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=524.4s)]
*  Detainees are typically housed in large rooms with 50 to 80 people in rows of metal bunk beds. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=529.76s)]
*  The residents are woken around 3.30 AM for breakfast at 4 AM, followed by lunch at 10 AM [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=536.48s)]
*  and dinner at 4 PM. A 2024 report evaluating conditions at immigration facilities across [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=543.68s)]
*  the state described the food as meager, highly processed and regularly spoiled. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=549.04s)]
*  This guy is not a criminal. He is currently being held as a prisoner because his involvement [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  in criticizing the Israeli government's actions in Gaza upset Israel, upset Netanyahu. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=564.4s)]
*  And Donald Trump, if the price is right, he'll do anything for you, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=572.4s)]
*  including sending innocent people into detention facilities. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Where they are suffering [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=580.8s)]
*  simply because they engaged in wrong think. Politically incorrect. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And they're being canceled. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=588.24s)]
*  Yeah, I only probably disagree with you is that he's not a criminal. He's the stereotypical kind [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  of criminal that we have now, which is thought criminals, which are literally the worst sort [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=593.84s)]
*  of criminals. And I'm not being like, I don't think I'm being hyperbolic there. I mean, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=598.16s)]
*  literally, he is being treated a thousand times worse than the people who tried to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=602.4s)]
*  beat the life out of cops on January 6th. They're walking free, many of them going on to commit [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=607.28s)]
*  other crimes. They're fine, they're patriots. They get to sing songs, they get lauded by the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=612.4s)]
*  president. He thought the wrong thing, so he is languishing in detention. He might never get out [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=617.36s)]
*  of there, or if he does, he might be sent to some country. We don't even know which one. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=624.0799999999999s)]
*  So the thought crimes in this case are objectively more serious from the point of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=627.76s)]
*  view of the regime than actual violence against law enforcement. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=631.6s)]
*  Yeah, I just think for all the people who are either self-identified libertarians, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=634.88s)]
*  right wingers, the public figures I'm talking about, who pretended to value free speech, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  freedom of expression, and are not speaking out against this. I'm definitely side eyeing you, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=648.48s)]
*  and you were full of crap from the very beginning. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=654.08s)]
*  But to be fair, there have been a number of people who were free speech warriors during [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=656.32s)]
*  the Biden administration and have been speaking out against what's happening to people like Khalil, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=661.04s)]
*  people like Ozturk, the Turkish student who was also arrested for having the audacity of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=667.8399999999999s)]
*  participating in an opinion piece for the student newspaper. It's just gross. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySDclKTIwqg&t=675.68s)]
