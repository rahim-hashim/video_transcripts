The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Republicans Are Finding Out in Real Time Americans Are ANGRY About DOGE Firings
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI)
*  The cabinet secretary's got [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=0.0s)]
*  certain responsibilities and [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=1.4000000000000001s)]
*  a president's got to get elected. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=2.74s)]
*  But when you have someone from [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=4.32s)]
*  the outside come in and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=5.72s)]
*  make some tough cuts, you could say [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=6.68s)]
*  I don't have my hands in that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=8.3s)]
*  The blowback they're getting in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=10.06s)]
*  some of these town halls is real. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=12.08s)]
*  Some on the right, including [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  conservative Fox News host Brian [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=17.54s)]
*  Kilmeade, are actually fessing up [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  to the fact that some Republican [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=22.12s)]
*  lawmakers are receiving backlash and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=24.22s)]
*  hostility from their constituents [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=26.62s)]
*  over what Donald Trump and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=28.82s)]
*  Elon Musk are currently carrying [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=30.62s)]
*  out in the federal government. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=33.14s)]
*  Essentially firing federal workers, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=35.34s)]
*  potentially slashing federal [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=37.88s)]
*  government programs. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=39.86s)]
*  However, Cenk, some Republicans [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=42.3s)]
*  apparently can't figure out why [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=43.82s)]
*  anyone would be upset. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=45.34s)]
*  Yeah, when you run on helping [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=47.42s)]
*  the economy and then you start [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=49.42s)]
*  firing everybody when you get in, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=51.46s)]
*  people might get upset. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=53.94s)]
*  So to me, the thing that I always [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=56.14s)]
*  say is yes, but [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=58.22s)]
*  what is this in service of? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=59.18s)]
*  Why are they doing this? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=61.46s)]
*  We'll explain that a little bit [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=62.82s)]
*  later. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=63.74s)]
*  So as just one example of the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=64.42s)]
*  hostility GOP lawmakers are being [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=66.38s)]
*  met with, let's go to Missouri [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=68.78s)]
*  Republican Congressman Mark Alford, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=70.98s)]
*  who was met with quite a bit of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=73.94s)]
*  rage at a recent town hall he [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=75.98s)]
*  hosted. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=77.82s)]
*  Now he also decided to praise [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=79.78s)]
*  Trump and defend Elon Musk, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=81.82s)]
*  even though the firings are [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=83.86s)]
*  affecting his constituents in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=85.7s)]
*  Kansas City, take a look. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=87.7s)]
*  Elon Musk has contracts with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=89.3s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=91.3s)]
*  But he is also, I think, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=93.22s)]
*  doing an effective job- [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=95.26s)]
*  Conflict of interest! [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=96.9s)]
*  Show me! [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=98.3s)]
*  Show me! [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  There are a lot of people who don't [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=99.34s)]
*  want to see waste, abuse, and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  fraud weeded out, some of them here [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  today, he said. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to be in charge of it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=106.86s)]
*  But he is a- [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=108.66s)]
*  He is police fraud abuse. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=109.42s)]
*  Now there are some people who [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=111.34s)]
*  don't want to see waste, abuse, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=113.58s)]
*  Now there are thousands of federal [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=116.98s)]
*  workers living in the Kansas City [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=119.54s)]
*  area, so you can understand why he [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=122.06s)]
*  would be met with this kind of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=124.7s)]
*  hostility. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  Their jobs are either on the line [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=128.26000000000002s)]
*  or they've already been fired. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=130.06s)]
*  In fact, so far at least 100 local [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=131.66s)]
*  IRS workers were fired. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=134.10000000000002s)]
*  That happened last week, but [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=136.62s)]
*  Alford was not really all that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=138.60000000000002s)]
*  sympathetic, while shockingly, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=140.62s)]
*  Kilmeade was on Fox and Friends. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=142.78s)]
*  Nonetheless, Alford at one point [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=144.78s)]
*  was quoted as saying, just because [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=146.82s)]
*  you have a government job doesn't [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=148.78s)]
*  mean it's a lifetime appointment [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=150.78s)]
*  like a Supreme Court. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=152.78s)]
*  So I would encourage anyone who [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=154.26s)]
*  finds themselves in this situation [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=156.06s)]
*  to realize we are going to get this [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=158.3s)]
*  economy turning again. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  There are jobs available. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=162.06s)]
*  God has a plan and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=163.78s)]
*  purpose for your life. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=165.14s)]
*  Now later he claimed that after [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=167.26s)]
*  the fact, the full quote was, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=169.22s)]
*  God has a plan and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=171.22s)]
*  purpose for your life, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=172.34s)]
*  you are not a victim, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=173.94s)]
*  you are a victor. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=175.28s)]
*  I don't know if that's supposed to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=176.78s)]
*  make them feel better, but [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=178.18s)]
*  he wanted to make sure that we had [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  the full statement. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=181.02s)]
*  He also says government employees [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=182.66s)]
*  are going to be let go and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=184.3s)]
*  that's just the reality. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=185.46s)]
*  I feel bad that people have been [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=186.58s)]
*  let go, I understand that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  So I guess a little bit of empathy, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=190.58s)]
*  but not much. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=192.3s)]
*  No, that's no empathy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=193.1s)]
*  He's just trying to cover his ass. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=194.5s)]
*  So guys, sometimes when you do [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=196.86s)]
*  cuts, some cuts are necessary and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=199.3s)]
*  some people will lose their jobs. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=202.22s)]
*  I think that the reason people are [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  so angry is because they didn't [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=207.1s)]
*  even ask if you're doing something [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=209.1s)]
*  wrong. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=211.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=211.86s)]
*  They just fired you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=212.38s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=213.38s)]
*  And that's why they're livid about [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  the injustice, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=216.1s)]
*  not just that they got fired. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=217.02s)]
*  No, you're exactly right about [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=219.58s)]
*  that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  And again, to reiterate, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  there is definitely bloat. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  There is waste in the federal [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=224.9s)]
*  government as there is in state and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=226.38s)]
*  local government as well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, Donald Trump would get [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=229.66s)]
*  so much praise if they were [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=232.18s)]
*  actually doing this methodically [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=233.78s)]
*  and not allowing the richest man in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=236.1s)]
*  the world to just cut back on [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=238.42s)]
*  the federal government indiscriminately. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=240.34s)]
*  I just figured it out in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=243.34s)]
*  the middle of the show. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=245.1s)]
*  And I'm like, why are they going [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=247.98s)]
*  like a runaway freight train, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=249.94s)]
*  totally out of control? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=251.9s)]
*  Well, what's the first story we did [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=254.46s)]
*  on today's show? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=255.74s)]
*  The Republicans just introduced [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=256.86s)]
*  a $1.5 trillion tax cut today, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=258.46000000000004s)]
*  right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=260.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=260.98s)]
*  And so, since the tax cuts going to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=261.62s)]
*  come up for a vote immediately, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=263.54s)]
*  because that's their number one [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=265.26s)]
*  priority, in fact, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=266.94s)]
*  it's almost their only priority. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=267.94s)]
*  They have to make a giant mess [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=269.94s)]
*  about and get all this attention [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=271.70000000000005s)]
*  around, we're cutting, we're [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=273.54s)]
*  cutting, we're cutting, we're [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  cutting, so they could make it [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=277.3s)]
*  seem like we're 4.5 trillion, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=279.04s)]
*  we're going to cut 8 trillion, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=280.98s)]
*  12 trillion, so [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=282.88s)]
*  don't worry about this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=283.98s)]
*  You just got that? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=285.42s)]
*  No, no, I know that the cuts were [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=285.98s)]
*  meant to allay the 4.5 trillion. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=287.86s)]
*  That was the thing I was going to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=290.02s)]
*  tell the audience at the end, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=291.18s)]
*  that's always their purpose. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=292.38s)]
*  But I didn't understand [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=294.34s)]
*  the reckless speed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=295.42s)]
*  But the fact that the tax cuts were [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=297.18s)]
*  already introduced this week [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  explains why they're going so fast [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=300.7s)]
*  and why they're being so reckless, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=302.94s)]
*  because they got to get everybody [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=305.02s)]
*  talking about those cuts [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=306.94s)]
*  immediately. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=308.38s)]
*  That's why they can't afford to be [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=309.82s)]
*  careful. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=311.46s)]
*  So, some who are, look, and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=312.46s)]
*  I want to be clear, there are a lot [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=314.34s)]
*  of Republican voters who so far [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=316.62s)]
*  have not had a problem with what [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=318.86s)]
*  Elon Musk has been up to. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=321.02s)]
*  That exists. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=322.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  So I want to be clear about [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=324.46s)]
*  something because their argument in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=325.66s)]
*  regard to these town halls is, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=327.66s)]
*  these aren't Republican voters, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  these are Democratic voters. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=331.3s)]
*  This is their effort to make it [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=333.14s)]
*  seem like Republican voters are [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=335.06s)]
*  pushing back against [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=337.1s)]
*  Republican lawmakers. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=338.42s)]
*  There is some truth to that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=339.82s)]
*  However, there's also truth to some [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=341.3s)]
*  Republicans now turning on Donald [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=343.58s)]
*  Trump because of what Elon Musk is [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=345.82s)]
*  doing, and we're going to give you [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=347.86s)]
*  some examples of that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  But what I'm referring to is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=350.9s)]
*  the Missouri Democratic Party. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=352.14s)]
*  They had encouraged attendance at [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  this town hall, including posting [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=355.62s)]
*  guidance and suggested questions [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=357.5s)]
*  on social media. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=359.34s)]
*  Numerous federal workers and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=360.62s)]
*  union representatives appeared to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  be in the audience. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=364.14s)]
*  So there is truth to the fact that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=365.21999999999997s)]
*  there were Democrats there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=366.94s)]
*  But there's also truth to the fact [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=368.42s)]
*  that in this district that this [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=370.18s)]
*  Republican lawmaker represents, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=371.78s)]
*  there's a lot of federal workers, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=373.78s)]
*  federal government workers. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=375.7s)]
*  Yeah, there's one last layer to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=377.54s)]
*  this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=379.22s)]
*  They realized that what right-wing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=379.74s)]
*  voters want most is tax cuts. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=382.58s)]
*  I'm sorry, that's their [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  politicians, is the cuts, right? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  So it seems like they're going to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=390.62s)]
*  lose a lot of independence with [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=392.22s)]
*  these radical, crazy cuts that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=393.78000000000003s)]
*  people didn't vote for. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=395.42s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=396.86s)]
*  Yeah, and so they are already [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=397.74s)]
*  losing them and you can start [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=398.9s)]
*  seeing it in the polls, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=400.06s)]
*  especially in Elon's polling and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=401.02s)]
*  Doge's polling, right? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=402.38s)]
*  But again, guys, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=404.06s)]
*  the timing is everything. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=405.26s)]
*  Because by the time they all [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=406.98s)]
*  figure out that the cuts weren't [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=408.74s)]
*  that much at all and were realigned [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=410.86s)]
*  and redirected to the new donor [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=413.02000000000004s)]
*  class, it's going to be too late [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=414.90000000000003s)]
*  because the tax cuts will have [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=416.70000000000005s)]
*  passed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=418.38s)]
*  I want to stop paying my federal [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=418.94s)]
*  taxes. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=420.18s)]
*  So like because- [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=420.74s)]
*  What am I funding at this point? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=421.42s)]
*  Because understand what I'm saying. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=423.3s)]
*  Yeah, they're willing to, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=426.5s)]
*  I just realized they don't mind [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=427.86s)]
*  losing the next election. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=429.3s)]
*  They don't mind if the Democrats [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  win the midterms or [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=432.3s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=433.06s)]
*  They don't mind if they lose [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=434.06s)]
*  independence. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=435.14000000000004s)]
*  They don't even mind if Maggie gets [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=435.66s)]
*  super mad at them later when they [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=437.70000000000005s)]
*  find out all the cuts were nonsense [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=439.62s)]
*  because they'll have already [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  gotten $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=444.1s)]
*  That's what all of this is about. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=449.94000000000005s)]
*  And guys, we spent a trillion [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=452.06s)]
*  dollars paying interest on our [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=456.98s)]
*  debt last year, okay? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=461.18s)]
*  Like adding more to the debt, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=464.38s)]
*  which clearly based on how things [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=466.5s)]
*  are going with the Trump [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=468.86s)]
*  administration is going to be [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=470.46s)]
*  devastating for this country. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=472.58s)]
*  Absolutely, we spent a trillion [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=475.18s)]
*  dollars last year on interest. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=478.1s)]
*  On interest, Cenk. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=480.98s)]
*  Look, I constantly communicate [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=483.22s)]
*  with MAGA and I tell you their [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=484.82s)]
*  actual opinions whether people [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=486.26s)]
*  believe me or not. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=487.78000000000003s)]
*  And in this case, some of them are [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=489.18s)]
*  like, no, no, that's going to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=491.58000000000004s)]
*  stimulate the economy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=492.58000000000004s)]
*  That's the same old Republican [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=493.38s)]
*  supply side economics. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=494.82000000000005s)]
*  We'll trickle it all over you [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=496.26000000000005s)]
*  later, the rich get the money [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=497.78000000000003s)]
*  first. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fed5zY6HCSI&t=499.1s)]
