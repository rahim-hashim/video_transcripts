# CNBC EXPERTLY Interrogates Trump Admin For Market Manipulation
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE)
*  He also seems to be a great stock pundit, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=0.0s)]
*  Earlier this morning, before the pause, he put out a message saying it's a great time [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=3.04s)]
*  to buy and here we are. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=7.24s)]
*  Here we are, much higher. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=9.84s)]
*  I'd always bet on Donald Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=10.84s)]
*  Every time I'd always bet on Donald Trump. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=13.76s)]
*  He also wrote DJT, which is a ticker for his media company. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=14.76s)]
*  No, no, no, every text he does. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=18.76s)]
*  That was just his okay. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Every text he sends to me, that's his name. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  But that was a great time to buy the market, right? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=23.56s)]
*  I mean, uncanny. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=25.28s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump understands that America is the greatest country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=26.52s)]
*  Sir, I will ask you directly, is the President of the United States participating in insider [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=32.56s)]
*  trading through his own private social media network? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=40.68s)]
*  I always bet on the guy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=43.56s)]
*  What I do is I bet on shifting the focus of this conversation as fast as possible. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=45.16s)]
*  That's right, folks. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=52.62s)]
*  Less than four hours before President Trump's announcement that he was pausing most of his [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=53.62s)]
*  tariffs for 90 days in the most schizophrenic economic policy this side of the Mississippi. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=58.14s)]
*  He told his millions of followers on Truth Social that it was a good time to buy, which [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  obviously raised questions about whether Trump was intentionally manipulating the market. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=69.06s)]
*  An accusation you just saw Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick skirt around on CNBC. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=73.98s)]
*  Before we get into more details, Cenk, your initial thoughts. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=80.38000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I might have a surprising opinion here and we got to pull up on it on the live [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=82.78s)]
*  chat. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=86.74000000000001s)]
*  Obviously shows live six to eight o'clock Eastern every day on YouTube. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  So is Trump intentionally manipulating the market? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=91.94s)]
*  A, yes, B, no, C, I'm not sure. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=94.58s)]
*  You might want to hold on your vote. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=97.62s)]
*  There's gonna be a compelling case that he is, but I'm going to make a case that he might [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=98.9s)]
*  not have. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=104.78s)]
*  But I'll explain, I'll explain why. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=106.66s)]
*  But first, let's give you some of the evidence, which is pretty damning. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=108.5s)]
*  Yeah, no, I do see how this can be both ways. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=112.1s)]
*  It's a pretty broad post. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=116.46s)]
*  Here's the post again. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=118.02s)]
*  This is a great time to buy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  DJT he posted on Truth Social is posting to a broad audience. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=121.74s)]
*  The same is telling a few people were a few people told let's get into it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  As you can see that was posted at 937 AM Eastern Time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=130.82s)]
*  And around 1pm, he announced the tariff pause which shot the cratering stock markets way [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=134.34s)]
*  back up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=140.22s)]
*  Shortly after that, Trump had Charles Schwab and other businessmen in the Oval Office where [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=141.22s)]
*  he touted how much money they'd made personally since the tariff reversal. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=146.18s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=152.3s)]
*  This is Charles Schwab. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=153.3s)]
*  It's not just a company, it's actually an individual. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=156.5s)]
*  He made 2.5 billion today and he made 900 million. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=159.5s)]
*  He's a financial. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=164.5s)]
*  And Trump himself also benefited from the market turnaround. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=169.62s)]
*  But how cute to see Trump and his billionaire buddies choking. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=172.06s)]
*  He made 2.5 billion. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=174.62s)]
*  Much of Trump's own net worth is in his stake in Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  and Technology Group. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  And what do you know? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=184.1s)]
*  The company's stock rallied with the broader markets after the announcement of the tariff [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=185.1s)]
*  pause closing the day up more than 21%. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  And now Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is suggesting that other Republican lawmakers [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=192.54s)]
*  were tipped off and cashed in as well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=197.26s)]
*  She told Spectrum News, quote, if people are pissed about insider trading here at the House, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=199.92s)]
*  look at what's happening at the White House right now and with the Republican Party. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=205.5s)]
*  Senator Lyndon Kevin Fry or Fray asked her, do you think he knew what he was doing when [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=210.26s)]
*  he sent out that message about stocks before he made the announcement? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=214.78s)]
*  To which she replied, it sure seemed like he did. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=217.42s)]
*  I don't think it was a coincidence. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=219.78s)]
*  And I've heard murmurings on the floor. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=222.22s)]
*  There may have been people that knew this was coming. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=224.46s)]
*  And I'm very interested in seeing some of the stock disclosures that come out when those [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=226.46s)]
*  reports are due. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=229.9s)]
*  And I'm very interested in what members of Congress have been buying and trading stocks [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=230.9s)]
*  in the last 24 hours prior to this tariff announcement. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=234.82s)]
*  Two other Democratic lawmakers, Senators Ruben Gallego and Adam Schiff, are now demanding [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=238.26s)]
*  a federal investigation into whether any White House officials or Trump family members were [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=242.38s)]
*  informed of the tariff pause in advance and use that information to conduct trades. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=247.17999999999998s)]
*  Also of note, before we go back to Cenk for more commentary here on this, is the clip [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=254.06s)]
*  we showed you up top of the CNBC host pressing Leutnick on Trump's manipulating of the market [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=258.86s)]
*  was removed from the video they published on their website and YouTube. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=263.46s)]
*  It's only on the Internet Archive. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=267.66s)]
*  So we were able to bring it to you here today, but shady, but also out in the open. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  Cenk, what do you think? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=274.06s)]
*  Please elaborate. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=275.06s)]
*  Yeah, so look, I'm very curious about the receipts and there will be receipts, which [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=276.06s)]
*  is what trades did these people in Congress do? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=281.38000000000005s)]
*  There might not be receipts for friends of Donald Trump. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=285.58000000000004s)]
*  Are we going to investigate all of them and figure out which ones knew the stock market [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=289.54s)]
*  boom was coming and made billions upon billions? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=293.56s)]
*  Well, he just pointed to two of them, okay? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=296.26s)]
*  But other than that, I don't know. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=299.18s)]
*  Okay, so that all looks very bad. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=300.82s)]
*  But the two things that cut in favor of not necessarily insider trading is one, he made [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=304.62s)]
*  the post public. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  So if you were going to tell all your buddies and your insiders and your Republican congressmen, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=311.5s)]
*  they should buy the market because you're about to boost it tremendously by going back [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=317.94s)]
*  on the tariffs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=322.06s)]
*  You might want to do that in private so that everybody doesn't have access to that information. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=324.18s)]
*  So on the other hand, if you do it in private, it's definitely illegal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=329.5s)]
*  If you do it in public, you might get that plausible deniability for whoever's following [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=335.66s)]
*  your account, etc. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=339.94s)]
*  And knows what you mean by that, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=340.94s)]
*  Although that one is not really subtle. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  This is a great time to buy. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=345.1s)]
*  So it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what he means. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=346.1s)]
*  So but you can see how that could cut in both directions. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=349.98s)]
*  So and then the other factor for me is he did this hours ahead of when the decision [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=352.18s)]
*  was announced. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=357.98s)]
*  So if you had it prearranged with people, hey, five minutes before I make a decision, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=359.4s)]
*  15 minutes, 30 minutes, I'll put up a post on True Social. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=364.18s)]
*  Okay, maybe that threads the needle between, hey, I didn't say it in private. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=367.9s)]
*  It's not insider trading. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=372.62s)]
*  I made it public, but wink, wink, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=373.62s)]
*  But if it's hours ahead, it really gives everybody an opportunity to buy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  If they think Trump means it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=379.38s)]
*  And the reason that the alternate explanation for why it might be hours ahead is because [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=381.62s)]
*  Trump didn't change his mind till hours later. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=386.82s)]
*  And there is reporting from Washington Post, New York Times and all the others saying that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=389.94s)]
*  a lot of people inside the Trump administration didn't even know that Trump was going to make [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=395.74s)]
*  this decision. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=400.14s)]
*  Because nobody ever knows what's in Trump's mind. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=401.14s)]
*  He makes up his mind at the last second and then surprises everyone with it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=403.58s)]
*  So it took him a while to get there. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=407.7s)]
*  He really, really didn't want to reverse himself. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=411.26s)]
*  But the bond market was collapsing and you can't have the stock market and the bond market [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=413.94s)]
*  collapsing. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=418.02s)]
*  That's an utter calamity, right? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=419.02s)]
*  So he was really forced into it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=421.2s)]
*  It is even possible that he was still in the mode of don't panic, don't panic, buy into [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=423.14s)]
*  the market before he changes his mind when he did that post. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=427.7s)]
*  I can't be any more generous than that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  But I really do believe that both of those things are possible. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=433.86s)]
*  And so I think in the poll I'd vote, I don't know. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=437.22s)]
*  But the most important thing, Ben, to me is, and what do we got? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=441.42s)]
*  No, 77% are sure. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=444.98s)]
*  He was trying to intentionally manipulate the market. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=447.86s)]
*  And look, I get it, given the circumstances, that's a fair conclusion. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=451.22s)]
*  So to me, Ben, did the Republican congressmen and senators make a whole heap of trades before [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  everyone else did? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=463.18s)]
*  That'll determine whether it was intentional or not intentional. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=464.86s)]
*  True, that will decide that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=468.09999999999997s)]
*  But to me, as far as the public post defense, I guess, and I don't know the legal standard [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=471.54s)]
*  on this. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=476.58s)]
*  I don't even know if it's been established. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=477.58s)]
*  But it's a little bit different just because he didn't post it on X or a widely used public [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=478.65999999999997s)]
*  platform for most Americans. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=484.38s)]
*  He posted it on his own platform. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=486.1s)]
*  While granted, anybody can join it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=488.38s)]
*  So it's not the same as posting it, say, in like a signal chat. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=491.26s)]
*  He's posting it on a very partisan platform that he owns only to people who follow him [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=494.42s)]
*  specifically and follow a very propaganda-filled channel that is all about presenting the world [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  in a very skewed way. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=505.5s)]
*  So people who are not blind supporters of this man may not, on moral grounds, want to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=506.5s)]
*  be following this platform or supporting that business. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=511.34s)]
*  And so in that case, is it just an insider tip to a broader but still sort of very selective [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=514.86s)]
*  group of people? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=521.9s)]
*  Because in those few hours, you can't expect the news to cover it and report it and get [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=523.02s)]
*  enough time for people to make purchases on their own more widely. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=527.42s)]
*  Yeah, I really don't know. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=530.62s)]
*  Because I hear what you're saying, and it does incentivize people to go to true social. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=533.8199999999999s)]
*  That's another conflict of interest for him, among many, many others. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=538.66s)]
*  But the other thing that gives me pause, Ben, is is he really gonna be worried about illegal [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=542.22s)]
*  insider trading? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  He breaks the law all the time. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=548.18s)]
*  And what are they gonna do, impeach him? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=550.3s)]
*  So I think my best guess, and I got it at 52.48, it's real neck and neck. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=553.38s)]
*  But my best guess is at that point, he was still trying to prop up the market before [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=559.5s)]
*  he decided to reverse himself on the tariffs. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=562.82s)]
*  But they should definitely investigate. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=564.94s)]
*  Because again, if the Republicans traded before the public, then they did know it ahead of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=566.78s)]
*  time and that is a huge problem if that's the case. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=570.9s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you mostly. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=574.3s)]
*  And I think also it probably, it certainly, like you said, won't be anything with consequences, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=576.26s)]
*  even if found to be unethical. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=580.42s)]
*  But obviously it's fine in the administration these days and in our government these days [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=582.4s)]
*  out in the open. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=586.56s)]
*  And of all the things he does, telling people now is a good time to invest pretty broadly [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=588.0s)]
*  to encourage people to make money back that they had just lost. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  As long as it was sort of broad and not privately spoken, I don't see how they nail him on anything [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=595.64s)]
*  here or how it was definitively bad. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=600.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and last thing is, don't get us wrong, there'll be no accountability. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=602.88s)]
*  Even if he intentionally did it, etc. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=608.28s)]
*  And they'll say, it was a public post and it's over, no accountability at all. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  So don't even dream about it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=615.68s)]
*  And they'll keep doing this, by the way, the market will keep going up and down and those [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=617.62s)]
*  billionaires will keep making tons and tons of money. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=620.64s)]
*  And they do have special access to Donald Trump, that we know for sure. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmSpVtp5TE&t=625.42s)]
