TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Lawmakers Pass The Buck To Voters To Fight Trump
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ)
*  Democratic voters are demanding more from their party. Representative Jason Crowe out of Colorado's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=0.0s)]
*  6th district is putting some of the responsibility back on them. So maybe this is part of a new [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=5.04s)]
*  strategy. At a recent town hall in Aurora, Colorado, Crowe faced a packed audience, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=13.84s)]
*  about 1300 people eager for stronger opposition to present to President Trump's rather policies. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  During the event, a woman in the front row even shouted, what are you gonna do? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=26.64s)]
*  Hey, people are hungry. In response, Crowe emphasized the importance of collective action, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=30.48s)]
*  stating if somebody threatens this community, tries to take their jobs, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=36.24s)]
*  tries to deport our law abiding friends and neighbors, I will fight them with everything [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=40.4s)]
*  we have. But he also had a message for the people in the room. This is where the homework comes in. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=45.36s)]
*  He said, look, you have a role to play too. He presented his citizen's guide to taking [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  action. So really a blueprint step by step will run it down for you. It was [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=57.28s)]
*  playing behind the congressman as he was on stage at the high school there in Aurora. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=61.52s)]
*  Number one, speak up. Share your personal stories online or with my office on how the Trump [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=65.92s)]
*  administration actions are impacting you. Number two, conduct oversight, report wrongdoing, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=72.4s)]
*  discrimination, retaliation to local authorities or to Congressman Crowe's office. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=78.72s)]
*  Number three, show up. Organize or attend community events in your neighborhood to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=85.36s)]
*  share information and build local solidarity. Volunteer, get engaged with communities, civil, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=89.84s)]
*  legal organizations, providing direct aid. And number five, be courageous. Don't be afraid or [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=96.56s)]
*  intimidated together. We have power. After the meeting, Crowe took the Facebook. He said that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=103.2s)]
*  Colorado voters are up for this challenge. And he said his constituents were energized by this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=110.56s)]
*  call to action. Listen. I can tell you what, the energy is high, the enthusiasm is high. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=116.88s)]
*  People are ready to roll up their sleeves. They're ready to fight and preserve our democracy, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  our community, to fight for the vulnerable. This administration is not what Colorado signed up for. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=128.56s)]
*  We certainly are not supporting the direction this is going and we're ready to work to push back on [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=135.44s)]
*  it. So I guess the question I have for you guys and Jen, you start, what do you think about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=140.16s)]
*  this approach? Crowe pushing back, encouraging his constituents saying, look, you're part of this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=145.6s)]
*  thing too, an elected official. I don't know, is it fair for an elected official to say, look, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=151.76s)]
*  you're part of this heavy lift too? Yeah, so normally it would and his suggestions are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=158.32s)]
*  perfectly fine. The problem is the context of the Democratic Party. So when the Democratic Party [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=163.84s)]
*  wins and they're in the majority, they say, well, look, it's your job to push us to do these bills. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=169.12s)]
*  No, it was our job to get you elected. It's your job to get the bills passed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  But they'll pretend that it's our job. And then when you go to push them, and this has happened [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  over and over again with Clinton, Obama, Biden, every time a Democrat wins, they go, no, no, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=183.76s)]
*  I'm not gonna do anything. You have to push me to do it. So that's when you look at Trump, look, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=188.64s)]
*  I don't agree with any of his policies, but he doesn't need any help in pushing forward. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=192.32s)]
*  He doesn't go to his base and go, well, I don't wanna do it, but if you push me, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=198.48s)]
*  maybe I'll go 10% in that direction. He goes 200% in the wrong direction right away, right away. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=202.64s)]
*  So when the Democrats are in the majority, they say, no, no, no, I don't wanna do anything. You [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=208.16s)]
*  have to push me. Don't push me, by the way. You have to push me, but don't push me. So I'm so [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=211.04s)]
*  sick of their games. So now they're in the minority. So they come in and go, okay, now you guys have to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  do the act of resistance. Okay, yes, I agree with that. But brother, you're in power. I know that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=219.12s)]
*  you don't have the majority, but you have a powerful seat. Bob in the middle of Colorado [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=227.2s)]
*  can't have the microphone that you have at any time that you want. You can get him a speech in the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  floor of the house. You can go on CNN. You can go and do anything and then amplify that message [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=240.88s)]
*  a thousand times, a million times more than any average citizen can. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  So my question back to them, yes, but what are you doing? What are you doing? And I'm not picking on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Jason Crowe. His list is perfectly fine. I'm saying overall for Democrats and certainly for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  Democratic leadership. And I know what they can do. And I've said it a couple of times, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=262.4s)]
*  happy to say it again. But the reason they don't do anything is because they're not actually driven [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=267.04s)]
*  by anything. You guys have heard me say this 2,000 times. Paid family leaves at 84%. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=273.6s)]
*  And it drives me freaking crazy that no one fights for it. If I'm Jason Crowe, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=282.72s)]
*  just a random dude, just one congressperson, I bet I can get paid family leave passed. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=291.76s)]
*  That's why I ran for Congress. But corruption and mainstream media will kill off any outsider on the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=297.04s)]
*  left. And the LA Times said, no, Cenk is too pugilistic. He would fight for you guys. That's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=305.6s)]
*  right. And that's the core of the problem. Forget me. Is there anyone here trying to fight for you? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=310.88s)]
*  And I don't mean just going on TV and calling people racist or whatever it is. And look, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=316.72s)]
*  at least that's a fight back. But I mean, are you going on TV and fighting for paid family leave [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=321.6s)]
*  or a proposal that is so popular and that is so needed and that the American people would love? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  And the answer is no, other than Bernie Sanders and Ro Khanna. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=333.36s)]
*  I'm not sure I know a single other Democrat who actually proposes positive action. Let's do this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=338.0s)]
*  And then the American people will love it. Instead, they go, okay, here's what you should do. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=345.68s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna go back on vacation and do more donor calls. But you guys resist to the best of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=350.4s)]
*  your ability. But we're all gonna, the lords of the manor will sit on their fat asses and do [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  nothing to help you. And that's what I can't stand. Jordan. Yeah, I don't entirely hate this, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=362.0s)]
*  but I'm with you Cenk. If the Democratic Party had a clear, concise opposition strategy and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=370.0s)]
*  Democratic leadership in Congress demonstrated they had a plan that they were working on and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=379.6s)]
*  executing, then here's how you can help. These are the steps that you can take to make what we're [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=384.88s)]
*  doing even more effective. But you have now, a couple days after the joint address, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=391.12s)]
*  excuse me, Democratic leadership expressing disappointment over how their fellow Democrats [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=397.44s)]
*  protested or interrupted during the joint address. You just spent the entire election [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  cycle saying Donald Trump was a threat to democracy, likening him to Hitler, saying [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=408.4s)]
*  this is the greatest threat to democracy this country has ever seen. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=413.67999999999995s)]
*  But everyone has to be quiet when he speaks. How do those two messages fit together? How can you [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=417.2s)]
*  reconcile those two schools of thought? So when your leadership is doing that, it demonstrates [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=422.96s)]
*  to voters, we don't have anything. We're gonna just sit on our hands, twiddle our thumbs, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=428.56s)]
*  and just hope that somehow, like you've talked about this week, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=434.24s)]
*  James Carville will just demonstrate that he is, or James Carville's school of thought is, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=438.64s)]
*  they'll be so reckless, they'll be so bad, it'll blow up in their face. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=445.44s)]
*  They're just going to wait for something to magically happen. No, they've got power, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=448.56s)]
*  they're unchecked, they're gonna do everything they can as fast as they can, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=453.76s)]
*  because Democrats aren't in a position to stop. So if Democrats had an opposition strategy, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=457.52s)]
*  then it's here's how you, the constituents, can help. Here's how we can be even more effective. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=462.32s)]
*  Here's how we can be even more stronger in our obstruction. But I think the voters and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=467.76s)]
*  the constituents are totally right. Ask him, what are you doing? Because it doesn't seem like much. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=472.08s)]
*  Yeah, it almost feels like, and this is probably going too far, but they're rather enjoying it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=476.08s)]
*  After having so many battles over the last 10 years, the fatigue, let's just let the other [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=482.64s)]
*  side take all the oxygen and then we'll regroup and just pop our heads back up like little [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=487.92s)]
*  gophers or something. But the party is, as you both talked about, there's this divide. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=494.24s)]
*  You have Al Green, who is represented there protesting about Medicaid, okay, real issue at [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=499.44s)]
*  Trump's address before joint Congress. And then you have others like, you mentioned Jordan [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=505.76s)]
*  Hussein, Carville and others saying, just hands off, step back, just let them mess up. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=510.88s)]
*  Do you think this kind of strategy calling out the electorate can work or, I like pro too, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=516.64s)]
*  but it almost made me angry. Are you kidding me? I'm asking you what you're gonna do and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=524.08s)]
*  you're pointing back at me, but can it work? I'll give you the last word before the break. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=530.24s)]
*  Yeah, it can work. It's fine if it's done in tandem with our elected representatives. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=534.24s)]
*  But our elected representatives aren't doing anything. They're just avoiding responsibility [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=541.84s)]
*  and saying, I don't know, why don't you guys do it? Wow, real profile and courage there [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=546.24s)]
*  and leadership. So look, guys, the Al Green protest, in my opinion, was a little bit [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=550.56s)]
*  counterproductive. But as we talked about earlier in the week, he had the right issue at least. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=556.0s)]
*  So he did it about Medicaid and that's definitely the right issue to do it about. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=561.2s)]
*  So if you're going to be Democratic leadership and you're gonna go tell Al Green to go sit down, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=565.36s)]
*  as they did just this week, I think it was yesterday. And they are yelling at their own [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=570.16s)]
*  representatives, Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Frost, etc. And they're telling them, shut up, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  don't fight back. It's incumbent upon you then, Hakeem Jefferies, to have your plan. You can't [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  just say, don't do your plan. You have to say, okay, now here's my plan and do you see why it's [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=591.76s)]
*  better and I need you to be more productive and come and join me in that plan. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=596.8s)]
*  But if your plan is nothing, then I'll take Al Green over nothing. I'll take any action, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=600.8s)]
*  I'll take a pulse over Hakeem Jefferies and Chuck Schumer. And so, for example, on Medicaid, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=608.64s)]
*  okay, look, real quick, what should Democrats do? I'll say it in every time so that you're not [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=617.12s)]
*  confused. They should have a coordinated media strategy and that doesn't mean get a consultant [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=622.0s)]
*  talking point and just blabber about it. It means authentically fight for something. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=625.76s)]
*  Then number two, pick the most unpopular things that they're doing and focus like a laser beam [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=630.0s)]
*  on those. They cut cancer research, they cut cancer research, they cut cancer research. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=635.2s)]
*  By the way, that was so unpopular. Mike Johnson today had to go on TV and say, okay, sorry, sorry, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=639.2s)]
*  we're bringing cancer research back. But the Democrats do that? No, it was like their own [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=644.0s)]
*  constituents that yelled at him so much, etc. That got them to, like the Democrats had no strategy [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=647.6s)]
*  on that. If you saw every Democrat on TV and podcasts and radio fighting back on cancer [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=652.48s)]
*  research and then they backpedal on cancer research, then we give the Democrats credit [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=658.48s)]
*  and we go, hey, nice job on that, right? So you have a coordinated strategy on [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=662.16s)]
*  the Medicaid cuts and you all go out there and go, they're cutting Medicaid, they're cutting Medicaid [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  and they're doing it to give four and a half trillion to the rich and I can't believe it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=669.76s)]
*  Then that's a coordinated strategy that could work. And focus your energies on the least popular [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=673.04s)]
*  things that they're doing and then find something super popular on your side that you proactively [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=678.16s)]
*  fight for. As I said, it could be paid family leave. The other thing it could be, but this is [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=683.6s)]
*  the thing that Democrats would never ever, ever do and this is the heart of the problem. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=686.9599999999999s)]
*  You could say, hey, you know what the real problem is? They're letting the donors run the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=691.68s)]
*  government. Elon Musk is their top donor. He runs domestic policy. Mary Madelson is [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=695.28s)]
*  third highest donor and she runs foreign policy and that would be true. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  And they could prove that in devastating fashion, but they won't. They'll just attack Elon Musk for [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=704.48s)]
*  his tweets and stuff, but they won't get into fighting against money and politics in the donor [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=711.2s)]
*  class cuz they have their own donors and they love money and politics. So the reason the Democrats [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=715.52s)]
*  don't do anything is because they don't want to do anything. Cuz their donors told them your job [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=721.76s)]
*  is to sit there and pretend that you're in favor of popular policies, but never ever, ever do them. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  That's why they're betraying you and letting you down. We need a new Democratic party. There needs [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=735.68s)]
*  to be new leadership that isn't, kumbaya, let's hold hands with Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=740.64s)]
*  and walk together in the prairie. No, your job to get a new Democratic party is to defeat those guys [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  and be the new leader of the Democratic party that actually gives a damn about the American [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=754.4s)]
*  people, the average American, and what the Democratic party was supposed to be about. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=759.04s)]
*  That's what they should do, but this current leadership will never, ever, ever do that cuz [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  they don't want to do that. All they wanna do is serve the donor class. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=767.76s)]
*  Yeah, just one other thing I wanna point out. Couple weeks ago, there was a story in Axios about [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=771.92s)]
*  how top Democrats in the House were livid at grassroots advocacy groups and progressive [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=779.12s)]
*  organizations for having their members call and ask these members of Congress what they are [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=785.04s)]
*  planning to do to push back against Trump. This came at the same time Hakeem Jeffries was tweeting [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=791.44s)]
*  things like, presidents come and go, but God is forever. Just saying, just pray on it, y'all. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=797.04s)]
*  You have thousands of progressives, your voters, your supporters, your donors, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=803.2s)]
*  individual donors calling and saying, hey, what's your plan? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=808.24s)]
*  They had nothing and they leaked to the press that they were upset about it. They were upset [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=812.08s)]
*  about civic engagement. And ultimately, they're upset because they don't care about these donors. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=816.72s)]
*  They care about the big donors. They care about the billionaire donors, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=821.76s)]
*  not the moms and pops giving $27. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDdEjeR1nQ&t=825.6s)]
