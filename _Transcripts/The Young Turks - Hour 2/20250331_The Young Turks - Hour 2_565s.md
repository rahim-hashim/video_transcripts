On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Disney Facing Lawsuit Over Snow White Casting
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o)
*  I was sort of taken back by the, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=0.0s)]
*  they're very proud to cast a Latino [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=2.92s)]
*  actress as Snow White. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=6.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=9.14s)]
*  But you're still telling the story [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=9.72s)]
*  of Snow White. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=11.3s)]
*  Still Snow White, yeah. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Seven Dwarves. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=12.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=13.24s)]
*  Take a step back and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=14.32s)]
*  look at what you're doing there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=15.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=16.84s)]
*  I know, that makes no sense to me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  So what- [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=20.0s)]
*  Because you're progressive in one [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=20.68s)]
*  way and then, but [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=22.36s)]
*  you're still making that backward [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=23.28s)]
*  story of Seven Dwarves living in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  a cave together. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Living in a cave together, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=28.52s)]
*  what the you're doing man? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  Have I done nothing to advance [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=31.64s)]
*  the cause? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=34.92s)]
*  Well, according to people with [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=36.24s)]
*  similar condition to Peter Dinklage, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=38.66s)]
*  they would say no, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=41.6s)]
*  you did not advance our cause. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=42.92s)]
*  And that has to do with a new [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=45.0s)]
*  lawsuit that has been filed against [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=46.92s)]
*  Disney by individuals who claim that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Disney engaged in discrimination by [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=52.08s)]
*  not hiring members of the little [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=54.78s)]
*  people community. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=57.22s)]
*  And instead using CGI and kind of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  moving away from Snow White and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  the Seven Dwarves, okay? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=63.18s)]
*  So let's get into these details. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=65.06s)]
*  That was Peter Dinklage actor. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=67.58s)]
*  He made those comments on the Mark [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  Marin podcast back in 2022. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=71.62s)]
*  Now a group of little people actors [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=73.7s)]
*  is suing Disney for discrimination. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=75.9s)]
*  So when Disney's live action Snow [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=78.42s)]
*  White was announced, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=80.38s)]
*  the studio stated that the Seven [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=81.78s)]
*  Dwarves would be referred to as [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=83.62s)]
*  magical creatures and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=85.69999999999999s)]
*  they would use CGI instead of human [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=87.05999999999999s)]
*  actors. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  Look, this is just my preference or [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=89.69999999999999s)]
*  my opinion, but [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=92.05999999999999s)]
*  I think it looks weird, okay? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=93.05999999999999s)]
*  But that's the direction they went [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=94.97999999999999s)]
*  in because clearly they wanted to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=97.33999999999999s)]
*  avoid offending anyone. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=99.5s)]
*  Clearly Dinklage's comments struck [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  a nerve with them and they took [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=103.66s)]
*  that as like a red flag and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=105.78s)]
*  wanted to go in a better direction. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=107.38s)]
*  And so the Dwarves are trying to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=109.97999999999999s)]
*  And so the Dwarves were voiced by [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=112.86s)]
*  obviously a bunch of actors. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=115.42s)]
*  Andrew Barth Feldman as Dopey, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  Titus Burgess as Bashful, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=120.38s)]
*  George Salazar as Happy, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=122.53999999999999s)]
*  Jason Kravitz as Sneezy, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=124.46s)]
*  Andy Grotulichan as Sleepy, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=126.5s)]
*  Martin Kleba as Grumpy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=128.9s)]
*  That was the only little person who [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=130.98s)]
*  did voice acting for [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=133.42s)]
*  the CGI characters. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=134.66s)]
*  I think that's important to keep in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  mind and then Jeremy Swift as [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=137.98s)]
*  the Dwarves, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  that's important to keep in mind, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=140.48s)]
*  and then Jeremy Swift as Doc. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=142.2s)]
*  Now they added, meaning Disney, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=143.64s)]
*  to avoid reinforcing stereotypes [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=145.64s)]
*  from the original animated film, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=147.64s)]
*  we are taking a different approach [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=149.68s)]
*  with these seven characters and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=151.64s)]
*  have been consulting with members [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=153.56s)]
*  of the dwarfism community. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=155.56s)]
*  We look forward to sharing more as [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=157.48s)]
*  the film heads into production [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=159.56s)]
*  after a lengthy development period. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=161.48s)]
*  But the community is not pleased by [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=164.52s)]
*  this because they feel that they've [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=166.44s)]
*  been robbed of acting [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=168.48s)]
*  opportunities, of which there [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=169.68s)]
*  aren't many in Hollywood as we [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=171.26000000000002s)]
*  know, and so they have filed [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=172.78s)]
*  a lawsuit as a result. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=174.6s)]
*  So one actress by the name of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=176.36s)]
*  Ali Chapman, who's part of this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=178.88s)]
*  community says, seven talented [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  little people actors could have [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=184.4s)]
*  played those roles in the live [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=186.8s)]
*  action remake and yet they choose [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  or chose to use cartoons, it's an [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  insult and discriminatory. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=193.88s)]
*  Her husband Matt McCarthy, who's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=196.12s)]
*  a little person stated, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=198.32s)]
*  we've been totally shut out but [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=199.74s)]
*  we're not going to go down quietly, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=201.56s)]
*  it's hard enough in Hollywood. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=203.68s)]
*  Everyone's trying to make their [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=205.56s)]
*  dreams come true. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=207.28s)]
*  When you're a little person, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=208.16s)]
*  opportunities are few and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=209.72s)]
*  far between. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=211.16s)]
*  I was born to play Dopey. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=212.28s)]
*  Like the last comment, okay, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=215.2s)]
*  I vote no on the lawsuit. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=216.76s)]
*  I've got a lot of different [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=218.12s)]
*  thoughts on this, but you don't [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=219.84s)]
*  have a right to an acting job. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=222.08s)]
*  So I understand what they're saying [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=224.64s)]
*  and I think that Dinklage, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=227.16s)]
*  who I really love as an actor, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=228.68s)]
*  might have done some damage there [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=230.24s)]
*  with that interview. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=231.96s)]
*  I'm almost certain that that's, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=233.08s)]
*  because it got a lot of buzz that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=234.72s)]
*  that's why they pulled the actual [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=236.28s)]
*  actors. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=238.08s)]
*  And so now they're mad but [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=239.44s)]
*  like if you're Disney, you're [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=240.72s)]
*  damned if you do, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=242.4s)]
*  damned if you don't, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=243.4s)]
*  So if you're going to put in real [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=245.04s)]
*  actors and then you got criticized [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=246.68s)]
*  for it, now you put in, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=248.6s)]
*  don't put in the real actors, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=249.84s)]
*  you get criticized and sued for it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=251.36s)]
*  So, look, I empathize with what [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=253.32s)]
*  damned if you do, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  damned if you don't. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=257.32s)]
*  So I don't know which way they're [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=258.36s)]
*  supposed to go. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=259.88s)]
*  By the way, this whole thing is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=260.76s)]
*  conundrum on top of conundrum, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=262.16s)]
*  right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=263.64s)]
*  So it's snow white in the seven [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  doors, but you're not supposed to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=266.44s)]
*  say dwarves anymore. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  But you can say it in a movie and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=270.8s)]
*  you can say it in Lord of the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=272.36s)]
*  Rings. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=273.76s)]
*  They're not little people in Lord [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=274.72s)]
*  of the Rings. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  Are they little people in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=276.8s)]
*  snow white? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=277.6s)]
*  So we've changed the words a lot, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=278.64s)]
*  right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=280.24s)]
*  And I empathize, I get it, but [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=280.76s)]
*  at the same time, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=283.32s)]
*  we got to settle in with one and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  keep it, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=287.23999999999995s)]
*  So- [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=288.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=288.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=290.28s)]
*  So my general thought about these [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  live action movies is maybe don't. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=294.11999999999995s)]
*  Maybe be creative and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  put out new content and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  you're not just piggybacking off of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=300.2s)]
*  content from the 1930s. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  Because obviously, content from [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=304.23999999999995s)]
*  the 1930s is not going to pass for [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=306.55999999999995s)]
*  what's acceptable today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=311.12s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=311.84s)]
*  So you're going to, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=312.44s)]
*  the decision to make this movie [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=313.6s)]
*  from the very beginning, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=315.08s)]
*  I mean, it should have been [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=316.28s)]
*  a red flag. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=316.96s)]
*  No, I got you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=318.0s)]
*  So you get into historical context [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=318.68s)]
*  and the conundrum that almost [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=320.6s)]
*  always presents, right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=322.12s)]
*  I mean, even on non-political [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=324.68s)]
*  things like Hansel and Gretel, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=326.48s)]
*  we watched some version of that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=328.24s)]
*  with the kids and regretted it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=329.72s)]
*  Because when the witch decides [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=331.4s)]
*  that she's going to eat [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=333.28s)]
*  the small children- [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=334.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=335.84s)]
*  It's problematic. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=337.0s)]
*  And by the way, a lot of the German [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=337.84s)]
*  stories that we get these from, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=340.2s)]
*  a lot of them are from Germany, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=342.76s)]
*  are about don't go in the woods. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=344.35999999999996s)]
*  Okay, the wolves will eat you, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=347.64s)]
*  the witches will eat you, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  everyone will eat you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  You know why? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=351.52s)]
*  The German woods are kind of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  scary, okay? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  That's why they wrote it in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  the 1930s in Germany, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=355.55999999999995s)]
*  in a different context, right? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=357.2s)]
*  But now everybody goes, no, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=359.11999999999995s)]
*  she has to be white or she has to, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=360.67999999999995s)]
*  or she can't not be white. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=362.64s)]
*  They have to be dwarves or [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  little people or CGI. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=365.0s)]
*  But why does Disney not move on? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=368.0s)]
*  Because there's money to be made. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=371.0s)]
*  No, I get it, I get it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=372.2s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=372.92s)]
*  And as I've talked about before, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=373.92s)]
*  these live action remakes, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=376.84s)]
*  it does attract an audience [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=379.04s)]
*  because of nostalgia, so I get that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  But if you're going to do it, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=384.48s)]
*  then do it, okay? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=386.0s)]
*  Because you can't be everything [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=387.52s)]
*  to everyone, you're not going to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=388.96s)]
*  be able to please everyone. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=390.24s)]
*  And so if you're going to do [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=391.56s)]
*  a remake of Snow White and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  the Seven Dwarfs, then go for it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=394.6s)]
*  And be unapologetic about it and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  move forward because you're going [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=399.0s)]
*  to upset anyone anyway, okay? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=401.08s)]
*  Or one group of people over [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=403.32s)]
*  another anyway. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  That's just the society we live in. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=406.84s)]
*  And until we just kind of steamroll [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  it, that society or that culture [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  within our society isn't going to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  go away, that's my take on it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=413.68s)]
*  Yeah, and whenever you have a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  situation like this, I always [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=416.76s)]
*  think about we'll show on [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=418.2s)]
*  the other foot, right? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=420.67999999999995s)]
*  it's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=421.52s)]
*  If you make it Snow White and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=423.12s)]
*  the Seven Little People, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  it sounds absurd, right? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=425.12s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=426.64s)]
*  But on the other hand, I think, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  what if it was Snow White and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=429.24s)]
*  the Seven Muslims? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=431.0s)]
*  My God. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  And you know the Muslims in this [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=434.16s)]
*  country used to be called [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=436.0s)]
*  Muhammadan or- [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=438.24s)]
*  Muslimen, okay? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=439.16s)]
*  And I was like, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=441.36s)]
*  would I care if we were called [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=442.16s)]
*  Muhammadan? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=443.88s)]
*  I don't know, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  Muslimen sounds kind of funny. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=445.72s)]
*  It almost sounds like Muslimen, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  not so bad. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  It does sound like Muslimen, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=451.0s)]
*  actually. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=452.16s)]
*  Yeah, so anyways, my point is, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=452.68s)]
*  look, I might be upset about it too [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=454.36s)]
*  if I was in that community, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=456.44s)]
*  depending on what my perspective [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  was within that community. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  I might have been in the Dinklage [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=460.68s)]
*  camp, I might be in the anti-Dinklage [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=461.92s)]
*  camp, I'm not sure. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  So I'm not trying to minimize [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=464.59999999999997s)]
*  their concern about it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  But a lawsuit ain't the way to go. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=467.64s)]
*  I mean, you weren't owed that job, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=469.4s)]
*  that's not a thing. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=471.0s)]
*  Yeah, and also, I mean, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  there's the debate about creative [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=473.68s)]
*  license. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=475.88s)]
*  I mean, Disney could very easily [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  say, well, we have creative license [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=478.28s)]
*  and we decided to go in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=480.0s)]
*  this direction. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=480.96s)]
*  Of course, of course they do. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=481.76s)]
*  I mean, and if it was Snow White and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=483.48s)]
*  the seven Mohammedans. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=485.56s)]
*  I really hope they never think of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=487.4s)]
*  that, that's gonna be crazy. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=488.8s)]
*  This is what you and Larry say. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=490.12s)]
*  Anyway, I wouldn't get to sue and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=491.64s)]
*  be like, I was definitely going to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  be one of the Mohammedans. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=494.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other thing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  So the actors that have decided to [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=497.36s)]
*  join this lawsuit, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=499.8s)]
*  a little presumptuous, no? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=501.24s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=503.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=505.2s)]
*  So yeah, it's an interesting [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=505.92s)]
*  debate, but I think I generally [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=507.8s)]
*  agree with you. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=509.92s)]
*  And again, if you're going to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=511.12s)]
*  remake a movie from the movie, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=513.2s)]
*  decades and decades ago, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=515.6s)]
*  the standards are going to be [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=517.0400000000001s)]
*  different, the cultural standards [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=518.5200000000001s)]
*  are going to be different. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=520.2800000000001s)]
*  You're either going to have to go [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=521.6400000000001s)]
*  for it and be unapologetic or [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=523.2800000000001s)]
*  just don't make the movie. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=524.6s)]
*  You're not going to be able to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=525.88s)]
*  please people, it is what it is. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=527.12s)]
*  Yeah, okay, last two things. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDE6TJlq0o&t=528.5200000000001s)]
