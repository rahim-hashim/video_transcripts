The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Dave Chappelle: What SNL Wouldn't Let Me Say
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678)
*  Comedian Dave Chappelle is alleging that the producers over at Saturday Night Live attempted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=0.0s)]
*  to censor his monologue when he appeared on the show last month. Now, per SF Gates Senior [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=6.48s)]
*  Culture Editor, Dan Gentile, who saw the comedian at the first of his three San Francisco standup [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=14.48s)]
*  appearances at the Masonic, Chappelle alleged that he was not allowed to speak about Gaza and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=21.6s)]
*  transgender people. So those were the two issues that the producers at SNL told Chappelle, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=29.84s)]
*  do not even weigh in on that. Please leave that out of your monologue entirely. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=36.56s)]
*  Now, he didn't listen entirely, which is honestly not that surprising. Remember, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=41.2s)]
*  he got a lot of backlash from transgender activists, the transgender community in regard [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=48.24s)]
*  to some of his jokes about the community. He doubled down, it almost became kind of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=53.84s)]
*  obsessive when it came to his specials. And to be honest with you, I think it's kind of hijacked [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=58.72s)]
*  his specials and kind of ruined some of the last few ones that he did. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=63.36s)]
*  However, it is interesting that they didn't want him to weigh in on Gaza or the Palestinians. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=68.8s)]
*  Turns out that was something he was unwilling to listen to. Now, before we get to what he said [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=75.12s)]
*  during his monologue, I just want to remind you all that he's actually been a fierce advocate [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=80.56s)]
*  of the Palestinians. So during a performance at the UAE back in May of last year in 2024, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=85.84s)]
*  here's what he said. So about halfway through in a wide ranging comedy set in Abu Dhabi, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=92.8s)]
*  Chappelle, a Muslim, initially said he had been told by his friends either to discuss the war or [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=99.28s)]
*  not. From the audience, a woman screamed, free Palestine, the crowd cheered. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  Chappelle then said the Gaza Strip faces a genocide. He also said that making Jews safer [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=111.28s)]
*  in America amid rising cases of anti-Semitism would make them realize they don't need Israel [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=117.84s)]
*  as an ultimate protector. I doubt that that would happen, but nonetheless, that's the argument he [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=124.8s)]
*  made. Now, according to the AP, even before coming on stage, the crowd at Abu Dhabi's arena [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=130.48s)]
*  basically cheered as Chappelle's DJ, DJ Trauma, played a song, My Blood is Palestinian, by the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=139.76s)]
*  Palestinian singer, Mohamed Asaf. So his views on the Palestinian people is pretty clear. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=147.76s)]
*  Now, fast forward to his monologue for SNL last month. He did not heed their warnings about [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  avoiding any discussion or any mention of the Palestinians. Here's what he said in the closing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  moments of his monologue. Quote, the presidency is no place for petty people. So Donald Trump, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=167.04s)]
*  I know you watch the show, man. Remember, whether people voted for you or not, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=173.44s)]
*  they're all counting on you. Whether they like you or not, they're all counting on you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  The whole world is counting on you. And then he says, I mean this when I say, good luck, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=182.88s)]
*  please do better next time. Please, all of us, do better next time. Do not forget your humanity and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  please have empathy for displaced people, whether they're in the palisades or Palestine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=194.96s)]
*  So he's referring to the fire ravaged Pacific palisades in Los Angeles, which by the way, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=202.96s)]
*  the recovery effort in regard to Altadena, Pacific Palisades, it's been a disaster, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  but that's a different story. But Cenk, the reason why I wanted to talk about this is because [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=216.96s)]
*  when you're in favor of censoring speech, when you're engaging in joke policing, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=223.04s)]
*  you have to keep in mind that that will impact speech that you yourself like. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=229.68s)]
*  You don't get to pick winners and choosers. In a society that is favorable toward a culture of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=236.16s)]
*  censorship, certain speech that you like, certain speech that you want out there is gonna be [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=242.64s)]
*  censored. And so you might disagree with his jokes and what he had to say previously about [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=247.92s)]
*  the transgender community. But opening up an avenue for censorship in that regard, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=252.64s)]
*  that'll translate into other issues. And in this case, we're talking about the Palestinian issue [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=260.4s)]
*  that he was almost censored against speaking about. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, well, Brandon Ehrlich, Jordan Yule and I were talking about this on Friday's show. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=269.36s)]
*  Now the right wing is trying to cancel Bill Burr for some of the jokes he made. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=274.56s)]
*  I like that we're cool again. What was Brett's point? You can check them out [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=279.92s)]
*  on Rebel headquarters, another TYT channel on YouTube. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=283.84s)]
*  And so look, anytime you're trying to shut down comedians, you're losing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=288.96s)]
*  So I hated Dave Chappelle's jokes about trans people because, it's not because they were [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=292.72s)]
*  just about trans people or about those particular issues. Certainly I've had my fights in that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=299.68s)]
*  category on all sides with the left wing, the right wing, etc. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=304.48s)]
*  And even in the midst of all of that, I said, look, I think Ricky Gervais pulled it off pretty [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=307.76s)]
*  artfully and did a great job with similar jokes. Chappelle just got obsessed and it was like show [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=312.88s)]
*  after show and it was so boring. So on the other hand, I've loved Dave Chappelle in the past. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=318.8s)]
*  So what do you do when you like some of his work and you don't like some of his work? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=323.68s)]
*  Cancel. No, you don't cancel. Okay, so you don't like his trans jokes. We're all gonna live. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=328.32s)]
*  He's not the president. He's not the commander in chief. And so you don't have to shut down [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=334.88s)]
*  everyone you disagree with. And it turns out you might wind up having interesting agreements. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=339.68s)]
*  So now all of a sudden, we've got Steve Bannon saying don't cut Medicaid, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=345.12s)]
*  increase corporate taxes. I mean, if anyone deserves to be canceled by Steve Bannon, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  but even so I say no. Why do I say no? Because look at him now, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=356.16s)]
*  turning around and potentially helping on those issues. I know, I know. For some, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=359.36s)]
*  no, no, anyone who disagrees 1% or 50% or 95%, don't let them speak. Don't let them make jokes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  Totally, utterly unacceptable. And by the way, who was doing cancel culture in this particular case? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=372.08s)]
*  It wasn't the far left. It was NBC. It was Saturday Night Live saying, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=378.64s)]
*  don't make jokes about trans people. And as we said, maybe it's because he just [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=385.84s)]
*  went so far on that and it's boring. It's I don't know, right? Even so, I'm against it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  Let him make any jokes he likes, okay? But don't make jokes about Israel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=395.12s)]
*  Why is Israel the poor, powerless victim, arguably like trans people and they really need, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=400.4s)]
*  oh, golly gee, if we could just find one person in favor of Israel on American television. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=408.88s)]
*  I mean, this is absurd. Now we can't make fun of the powerful either. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=414.56s)]
*  You see, once you start cancel culture, there's no end to it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=419.12s)]
*  And to be fair to get to the far left, cancel culture on Israel has been around as long as [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=422.48s)]
*  American media has been around. I mean, now you could at least criticize Israel in media to some [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=427.28s)]
*  degree, slightly under certain circumstances. For all my life, if you criticize Israel and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=432.88s)]
*  American media, you are gonna get fired, period. So that cancel culture has been here forever. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=439.67999999999995s)]
*  So let the brother make the jokes. And by the way, it's interesting too that the producers at [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=445.44s)]
*  Saturday Night Live tell, I keep forgetting Dave Chappelle is Muslim, tell a Muslim man, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=450.79999999999995s)]
*  don't you dare make jokes complaining about Muslims being slaughtered. Know your role. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=455.36s)]
*  And that is a disgusting thing to say. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IylLitmQ678&t=462.88s)]
