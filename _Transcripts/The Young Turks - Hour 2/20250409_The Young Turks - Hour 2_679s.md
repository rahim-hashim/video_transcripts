Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# RFK Jr. Is Doing JACK To Handle The Measles Outbreak
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso)
*  They anybody who wants a vaccine can get one, but if people don't want it, they shouldn't be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=0.0s)]
*  the government shouldn't force them to do it. There are adverse events from the vaccine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=4.48s)]
*  It was a second child with measles in Texas has died amid a rapidly growing outbreak. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=14.72s)]
*  It's important to note they said the child was not vaccinated against [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=19.44s)]
*  measles and had no underlying health conditions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=22.96s)]
*  So, R.F.K. Jr., who is the Secretary of Health and Human Services, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=25.28s)]
*  says there could be adverse effects from vaccines. There could also be deadly effects from not getting [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=32.72s)]
*  your children vaccinated for things like measles. And unfortunately, a second child has died [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=40.24s)]
*  from measles amid a fast growing outbreak that began in Texas and continues to spread across [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  the country. Now, unfortunately, HHS Secretary R.F.K. Jr.'s leadership could be making a bad [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=53.44s)]
*  situation even worse. And I'm gonna tell you how in just a minute. But first, some context [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=61.68s)]
*  into this story. Let's dive into the current state of this outbreak before we learn more about his [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=66.08s)]
*  role in all of this. So, Texas Health and Human Services reports that as of earlier this week, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=71.36s)]
*  there are measles outbreaks in South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=78.24s)]
*  There have been 505 cases identified since late January. The number was, by the way, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=84.08s)]
*  481 just this past Friday. So, it just continues to spread, continues to grow. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  57 patients have been hospitalized and two school-age children have tragically [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=95.44s)]
*  died, who lived in the outbreak area have died. Now, both children were unvaccinated and had no [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=102.88s)]
*  comorbidities, right? So, the argument that they might have died from other health complications, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  not true. They had no other known underlying conditions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  It's just so dumb. It's so dumb because these kids didn't need to die. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  They didn't need to die. The measles vaccine has been around for a long, long time. But here we are [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  on Saturday, NBC News reported that nationally there have been 628 measles cases reported in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=131.04s)]
*  at least 21 states and Washington, D.C. And that number has increased since then. Now, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=138.32s)]
*  it's already considered a vast underestimate since people aren't getting tested for measles. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=146.56s)]
*  Before we get to RFK Jr.'s response, John, you have a young child. I can't ever imagine you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=152.48s)]
*  risking your child's life by not getting them vaccinated with the measles vaccine. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=160.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=165.12s)]
*  But what are your thoughts about this? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=165.84s)]
*  I think after seeing this, I'll probably get her vaccinated. I think, no, obviously we have been. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  I hate that it's now become so normalized that even our we have an awesome doctor for Reyna. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=175.76s)]
*  And she was hesitant when initially talking about, she wants to ask if we were going to, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  but she can't, I guess, seem pushy because like parents might freak out or something if you imply [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=189.36s)]
*  that we should listen to medical science. And we were like, yeah, of course we're gonna get her [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=194.96s)]
*  vaccinated. And by the way, being vaccinated doesn't mean that you're necessarily with this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=200.0s)]
*  or other things totally free and clear now that we're gonna have a country that has more and more [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=204.24s)]
*  of this stuff just boiling up around us. But it's the best that we can do, so we're gonna do it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=210.64s)]
*  And this outbreak probably would have happened without RFK Jr. I don't know that we can really [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=215.76s)]
*  tie that to him. But RFK Jr., being in the position he's in and this happening are both [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=221.44s)]
*  symptoms of the exact same needless, self-destructive, dark impulse. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=226.64s)]
*  This spreading hatred of expertise, hatred of research and science, and it's claiming lives. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=231.68s)]
*  And in a time when there's so many problems that we can't immediately solve, the fact that we're [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=238.64s)]
*  choosing to cause new problems for ourselves is just so, I was gonna swear, stupid. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=242.72s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=248.16s)]
*  Yes, I totally agree that it's stupid. And I also wanna be very clear to note that, no, this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=248.88s)]
*  spread of measles, I'm not gonna blame RFK Jr. for that, right? The latest [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=258.0s)]
*  fast growing outbreak is not his fault. I'm not gonna pin that on him. However, as HHS secretary, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=265.84s)]
*  he has a responsibility to not spread misinformation about vaccines. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=272.96s)]
*  And I just feel that his response to these two young kids dying as a result of measles [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  leaves much to be desired. So look, RFK Jr. learned from his previous mistakes because when [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=286.32s)]
*  the first child died from measles recently, there was no response from HHS for two days. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=295.52s)]
*  And apparently, there was some turmoil within the Trump administration over that. There were [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=301.92s)]
*  Trump administration officials who were upset about that. And the White House Communications [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=306.56s)]
*  Department was frustrated because they felt that they were doing the job that HHS was supposed to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  do in messaging. But in this case, after the second child died, he did put out a statement [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=317.36s)]
*  immediately. And so he also traveled to the outbreaks epicenter to aid in the response. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  You can aid in the response by saying the measles vaccine has been around for a long time [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=331.28s)]
*  and has proven to protect children from dying as a result of measles. But okay, on X, he wrote, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  I came to Gaines County, Texas today to confront the Hildebrand family after the loss of their [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=343.12s)]
*  eight-year-old daughter Daisy. I got to know the family of a six-year-old, Kaylee Fair, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=349.52s)]
*  who after she passed away in February, I also developed bonds with and deep affection for [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=356.4s)]
*  other members of this community during that difficult time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  And then he added this note toward the end, the most effective way to prevent the spread of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=367.84s)]
*  measles is the MMR vaccine. I've spoken to Governor Abbott and I've offered HHS's continued support. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=373.2s)]
*  At his request, we have redeployed CDC teams to Texas. We will continue to follow Texas's lead [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=382.16s)]
*  and to offer similar resources to other affected jurisdictions. So that was good. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=389.6s)]
*  That was a good response. But then he turned around and did a 180. So literally hours after [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  advocating for the vaccine and attending the funeral for one of the children who died [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=402.16s)]
*  after not being vaccinated and getting measles, he puts this statement out. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=407.44s)]
*  This is a later post. I also visited with these two extraordinary healers, Dr. Richard [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=414.72s)]
*  Bartlett and Dr. Ben Edwards, who have treated and healed some 300 measles stricken Mennonite children [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=420.88s)]
*  using aerosolized- [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=428.24s)]
*  Badesinide? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=431.76s)]
*  Badesinide and clarithromycin? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=432.56s)]
*  I think it's clarithromycin. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=436.64s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=438.8s)]
*  I've heard of that one. I haven't heard of the other. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=439.2s)]
*  I haven't heard of either one of those, but what are we doing? Why are we doing this? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  According to CNN, Dr. Richard Bartlett faced disciplinary action from the Texas [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=446.32s)]
*  Medical Board more than two decades ago for unusual prescribing of antibiotics and steroids [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=451.68s)]
*  in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=458.24s)]
*  They came in with a variety of complaints, including diabetes, back and neck pain, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=462.56s)]
*  sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils, and other cold symptoms, obesity, and uncontrollable hunger, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=467.12s)]
*  according to the Medical Board's investigation. The report stated that after reviewing the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=473.12s)]
*  patient's medical records, the board found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=478.88s)]
*  mismanaged their care, and ordered unnecessary tests and treatments. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=483.6s)]
*  In a 2003 order, the board cited him for inappropriately using medications such as [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=489.84s)]
*  powerful IV antibiotics and multi-day doses of long-acting steroids without any documentation [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=497.84s)]
*  in the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=505.04s)]
*  He also treated COVID patients with that silver bullet treatment, which we heard a lot about [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=512.16s)]
*  during the pandemic. It's an experimental mix of the steroid, butasone, butasoneid, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=517.52s)]
*  and the antibiotic that John pronounced perfectly, and aspirin. Okay, whatever. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=525.28s)]
*  Look, my point is you had a good response after the second child died for measles, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=532.4s)]
*  but instead of just leaving it there, he did the 180 hours later with that second post. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=538.88s)]
*  And it's just, I don't know. I don't know what to say, John, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=543.84s)]
*  because the vaccine skeptics are gonna be vaccine skeptics. I don't know what to say to convince [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  anyone of anything. It's just tragic that children are dying from something they don't need to die [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  from at all. 100%. I mean, that to us is the tragedy. Other people, unfortunately, think [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=558.24s)]
*  people vaccinate their kids is the tragedy. That's the split that we have. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=564.4s)]
*  And RFK Jr. is doing what we said he would do. That's all it is. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=568.48s)]
*  And I don't know what the solution is, because look, I'm gonna be honest with you. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=573.04s)]
*  Get your kids vaccinated and hope that they survive until [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=576.4s)]
*  people with actual expertise are back in charge. I mean, I would 100, if I had kids, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=579.2s)]
*  I would definitely vaccinate them. I'm not in the anti-vaccine camp at all. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=583.76s)]
*  But people do have this negative reaction to the federal government mandating anything. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=588.72s)]
*  And so I don't know how to deal with that, right? I don't know how to approach that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=595.2s)]
*  personality trait in some folks, right? Because I get it. I get not wanting to be told what to do. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=604.08s)]
*  I understand being skeptical of the government and all of that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=612.16s)]
*  But at the same time, we're not talking about a new vaccine here. We're talking about a vaccine [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=616.0799999999999s)]
*  that's been around for a long time and has saved countless children from death [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=619.92s)]
*  as a result of measles. So I just hope if anyone who is a vaccine skeptic, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=624.7199999999999s)]
*  who might be watching the show, just takes that into account. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=630.64s)]
*  Please, please, please protect your kids, please, because this is spreading. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=634.16s)]
*  There are kids dying now. It doesn't need to happen, but here we are. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=638.4s)]
*  Yeah, the last thing I wanna say is there's MAGA people who love this. They want RFK Jr. to come [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=642.24s)]
*  in, stop the vaccines. They want him to get the floor right out or whatever, which now they're [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=650.0s)]
*  making moves on that. And they're loving Trump's announcement about coal that you covered. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=654.24s)]
*  And then they chant, make America healthy again. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=659.04s)]
*  I know, yeah. I know. Those two things are kind of in tension. There's some tension between those [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  two things, but anyway. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOlX_9Apso&t=670.24s)]
