The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# HUGE RFK JR SCANDAL BREAKS
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4)
*  Are you right about Trump? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, the way that you build a truly [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=1.9000000000000001s)]
*  vicious nationalist movement is to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  wet a relatively small core of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=5.7s)]
*  belligerent idiots to a much larger [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=7.28s)]
*  group of opportunists and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=9.26s)]
*  spineless fellow travelers whose [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=10.74s)]
*  primary function is to turn [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=12.72s)]
*  a blind eye to things. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  We may not have that many outright [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=16.4s)]
*  Nazis in America, but [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=18.04s)]
*  we have plenty of cowards and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=19.2s)]
*  bootlickers. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=20.6s)]
*  And once those fleshy dominos start [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=21.6s)]
*  tumbling into the Trump camp, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=23.48s)]
*  the game is up. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=25.12s)]
*  Well, following today's Senate [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=25.92s)]
*  Finance Committee vote to advance [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=28.44s)]
*  RFK Jr's nomination to serve as [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=31.160000000000004s)]
*  HHS Secretary, a ton of news [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=33.68s)]
*  reports came out alleging that RFK [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=36.040000000000006s)]
*  Jr had settled sexual misconduct [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=38.96s)]
*  allegations. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=41.56s)]
*  We're learning more about how much [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=42.52s)]
*  money was behind those settlements. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  And we'll get back to those [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=47.2s)]
*  comments RFK Jr made on the ring of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=48.84s)]
*  fire in just a minute. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  That was the video of the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  video we just showed you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=54.26s)]
*  But first, it's important to know [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=55.78s)]
*  that Mediaite learned that a woman [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=58.019999999999996s)]
*  who accused RFK Jr of sexual [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=60.3s)]
*  misconduct back in 2020 was paid [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=62.22s)]
*  almost a million dollars as part of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=64.58s)]
*  a settlement that came along with [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=67.2s)]
*  an NDA, a non-disclosure agreement. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=69.58s)]
*  So according to Mother Jones, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=72.34s)]
*  who also reported on the story, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=74.18s)]
*  on Friday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=76.1s)]
*  responding to written questions [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=78.22s)]
*  from Senate Democrats revealed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=80.26s)]
*  information about his personal [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=82.46s)]
*  history that was not yet part of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=84.26s)]
*  the public record. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=86.17999999999999s)]
*  He had settled at least one case in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=87.34s)]
*  which he had been accused of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  misconduct or inappropriate [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=90.72s)]
*  behavior. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=92.42s)]
*  Kennedy also acknowledged that he [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=92.98s)]
*  had been party to at least one [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=94.94s)]
*  non-disclosure agreement. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=96.58s)]
*  But in that reply, Kennedy provided [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=98.18s)]
*  no details about these allegations. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=100.3s)]
*  He only offered a one word reply [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=102.38s)]
*  when asked if he had ever been [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=104.66s)]
*  accused in such a fashion, yes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=106.66s)]
*  Now, again, Kennedy didn't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=109.22s)]
*  provide Democrats with a total [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=110.94s)]
*  financial amount of the settlements, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=112.9s)]
*  nor did he indicate that the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=115.58s)]
*  misconduct or inappropriate behavior [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=117.26s)]
*  was. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=119.7s)]
*  However, sources have told [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=120.26s)]
*  Mediaite that one of the women who [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=122.3s)]
*  accused Kennedy of misconduct [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=124.7s)]
*  worked with Children's Health [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=126.9s)]
*  Defense, an anti-vaccine [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=129.02s)]
*  nonprofit Kennedy served as [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=130.86s)]
*  the chairman of until he announced [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=132.82s)]
*  his run for president in 2023. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=135.14s)]
*  Now, he was also accused of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=137.38s)]
*  announcing his run for [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=138.82s)]
*  president in 2023. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=140.06s)]
*  The payout was a high six figure [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=141.58s)]
*  sum, under a million dollar, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=143.82s)]
*  sources said. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=145.9s)]
*  So it was close to a million, but [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=146.86s)]
*  it was under a million. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=148.22s)]
*  Now, will Republicans care about [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=149.38s)]
*  these allegations, the settlement? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=151.82s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=155.7s)]
*  It depends on which Republican [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=157.46s)]
*  you're talking to. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=158.66s)]
*  However, they might care about [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=159.66s)]
*  Kennedy's past ties to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=161.46s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=162.76s)]
*  For weeks, conservative leaning [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=164.54s)]
*  groups, activists, and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=166.34s)]
*  policy groups have been privately [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=167.66s)]
*  sharing links to Kennedy aid [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=169.74s)]
*  Stephanie Spears past social media [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=171.62s)]
*  and blog posts that show her [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  support for Democratic causes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=175.78s)]
*  Three people familiar with [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=178.78s)]
*  the messages tell Axios. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=180.3s)]
*  So Spear, who has been referred to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=181.94s)]
*  as RFK Jr's safety blanket, serves [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=184.62s)]
*  as his executive assistant, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=187.54000000000002s)]
*  scheduler and manager, and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=189.94s)]
*  has known Kennedy for [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  more than a decade. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=194.46s)]
*  So she shares an interest in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=196.54s)]
*  activism on environmental issues, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=198.3s)]
*  and she has some skepticism on [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=200.82s)]
*  vaccines as well, obviously. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=202.94s)]
*  I mean, she works closely with [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=205.02s)]
*  RFK Jr. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=206.5s)]
*  However, MAGA is concerned that she [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=207.3s)]
*  could potentially stray Kennedy [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=209.82s)]
*  from the Trump agenda to a more [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=212.02s)]
*  left-wing agenda. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=214.14s)]
*  So are these two things at all [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=215.9s)]
*  tied? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=218.54s)]
*  Yeah, so look, couple things. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=219.78s)]
*  First of all, they found out that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  his close advisor was on the left. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  So was Bobby Kennedy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  So where's the question? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=227.42s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  And if you talk to MAGA guys, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=230.38s)]
*  which I have committed [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=232.06s)]
*  the crime of doing, you'll find [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=233.42s)]
*  out that they're actually kind of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=235.26s)]
*  proud that in their mind, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=237.17999999999998s)]
*  it's not only right-wingers. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  That Bobby Kennedy Jr. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=240.34s)]
*  is an environmental lawyer, etc. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=241.34s)]
*  And they brag about that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=243.82s)]
*  She's a big camp and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=245.14s)]
*  Tulsi and all these guys. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=246.22s)]
*  Now, I think Tulsi's kind of always [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=247.38s)]
*  been an opportunist slash [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=249.22s)]
*  right-winger. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=250.54s)]
*  But Bobby Kennedy Jr. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  was a real Democrat and so [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=252.26s)]
*  was Spear, etc. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=253.38s)]
*  So okay, but it's not news. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=255.22s)]
*  So when they're leaking that he's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=257.54s)]
*  associated with Democrats, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=259.74s)]
*  we already knew that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=261.7s)]
*  So but they're trying to create [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=263.62s)]
*  anger towards him, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=264.86s)]
*  So, and by the way, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=265.90000000000003s)]
*  don't get me wrong, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't believe him when he says, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=267.94s)]
*  yeah, Senator Cassidy, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=269.86s)]
*  vaccines and autism, no link. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=271.22s)]
*  I don't know what you're doing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=272.82s)]
*  No, when he gets- [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=274.74s)]
*  They're going to tell you what you [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=275.42s)]
*  want to hear. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=276.66s)]
*  Of course, and then when he goes [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=277.22s)]
*  in, he's going to do whatever he [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=278.7s)]
*  wants and thinks is right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=280.22s)]
*  Okay, but here we go again with [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=282.06s)]
*  the sexual misconduct. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=283.62s)]
*  Whenever any industry, corporation, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=285.14s)]
*  donor wants to sink someone, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=287.82s)]
*  sexual misconduct. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=289.86s)]
*  Now in the case of Bobby Kennedy [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=291.82s)]
*  Jr., as we've talked about many [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=293.14s)]
*  times, they usually look for [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=294.58s)]
*  a needle in a haystack, but [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=296.06s)]
*  that brother's got a haystack full [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=297.34s)]
*  of needles. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=298.86s)]
*  He does, yes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  Right, I mean, he's got every kind [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=300.14s)]
*  of personal issue in the world. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  But two things can be true at [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=304.46s)]
*  the same time. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=306.18s)]
*  While I oppose him on other [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=307.7s)]
*  grounds and while I think he does [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=309.14s)]
*  have all of those issues, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=310.86s)]
*  they are coming to get him. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=312.34s)]
*  And it looks like it might be [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=314.18s)]
*  right wingers coming to get him, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  at least the politician and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=316.82s)]
*  consultant lobbyist crowd. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=318.14s)]
*  And if they do get him, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=319.82s)]
*  I hope MAGA notices that it was [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=321.62s)]
*  their own slimy politicians who [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  took him out on behalf of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=326.14s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies, etc. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHteA8iF0N4&t=327.86s)]
