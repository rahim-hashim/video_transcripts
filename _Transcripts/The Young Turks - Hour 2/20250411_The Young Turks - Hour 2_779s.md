"Canadian-American venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya sparked a wave of condemnation this week after he said that he became disillusioned by the Democrats over Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama not taking his calls after being a ‚Äúmega-donor‚Äù to the party. Palihapitiya, who co-hosts the popular All-In podcast, went on to say the opposite dynamic exists with the Trump administration."

# Venture Capitalist Makes AMAZING Admission About Trump
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA)
*  This is one thing I'll tell you about the Trump administration, which is totally different. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, I was a lifelong Democrat, okay? I was a mega donor to the Democrats. Like dinner [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  with Obama level donor, okay? I couldn't get a phone call return from the White House to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=12.94s)]
*  save my life. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=18.72s)]
*  The only thing that happened to me was I made an off-caller comment about something in China. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=19.96s)]
*  And I had the Biden administration basically say something, like essentially put out a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=27.48s)]
*  press release, basically saying I was mean. The Trump administration is totally different. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=31.4s)]
*  There's not a single person there you can't get on the phone and talk to. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=37.76s)]
*  As I think you would exactly expect. Venture capitalist, that is venture capitalist Shamath [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=42.16s)]
*  Palapitiya right there, one of the hosts of the All In podcast made that stunning admission [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  on Andrew Schultz's flagrant podcast this week. When he got pushed back, Palapitiya [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=53.64s)]
*  doubled down even harder. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=58.48s)]
*  We will get back to that shortly, but Cenk, right off the top, your thoughts. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=61.12s)]
*  Yeah, so two things can be true at the same time. This is an amazing admission. He's gonna [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=66.84s)]
*  go on and on as you're gonna see here. And one of the hosts even challenges him on this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=72.64s)]
*  And so and all Democrats appreciate this admission that the Republicans are a lot more attuned [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=77.04s)]
*  to the needs of donors. But there is something that he's saying that is a legitimate critique [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=84.48s)]
*  of the Democratic Party. So I wanna talk about that as well. Two things can be true at the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=90.6s)]
*  same time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=95.28s)]
*  First, let's see the basically the confession. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=96.28s)]
*  Yeah, so let's give a little bit of brief context first on Palapitiya. He's the CEO [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=99.48s)]
*  and founder of Social Capital. Forbes estimates his net worth at $1.2 billion. He was also [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=104.4s)]
*  an early senior executive at Facebook. Palapitiya is highly involved in politics, as he mentioned [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=110.16s)]
*  in the cold open. Yertem state he donated to Obama and Biden. He also donated to RFK [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=115.24s)]
*  Jr. and Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=120.44s)]
*  He brought up a mean comment about China in that same clip. Well, he was actually referring [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=122.0s)]
*  to the persecution of the Uyghurs in China. Here's what he said in 2022 about that. Quote, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=126.22s)]
*  Let's be honest, nobody cares about what's happening to the Uyghurs. You bring it up [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  because you really care and I think that's nice that you care. The rest of us don't care. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=135.72s)]
*  I'm telling you a hard, ugly truth of all the things I care about, it is below my line. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=139.56s)]
*  Context aside, let's now watch more of his appearance on flagrant. Here's how he described [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=145.72s)]
*  his communication with the Trump administration. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=150.96s)]
*  I'll give you an example of this. A friend of mine's company was really impacted with [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=153.44s)]
*  these tariffs in a bad way. This is like a really amazing, legitimate American business, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=158.24s)]
*  150 year old business, family owned, all this stuff. And I was able to call the deputy chief [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  of staff and I said, hey, can you talk to the CEO and just say here on the ground? He's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=169.12s)]
*  like instantly put me on the phone. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=174.0s)]
*  My wife runs a pharmaceutical business and we wanted to make sure that the administration [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=177.96s)]
*  understood all the implications for rare diseases and orphan drugs. What happens if these tariffs [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  cripple the R&D budgets? We were able to talk to all of them. They were like, explain the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=191.56s)]
*  issue, I want to understand it. So this is what's also totally different, which I really [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=196.0s)]
*  give them a lot of respect. They are willing to debate it with you. You can pick up the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  phone and talk to these people. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=205.44s)]
*  I've never had that experience, guys. I mean, look, I was like a senior person at Facebook, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=208.28s)]
*  I'd never get a meeting. I only met Obama once when he came to the thing. Then when [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=213.0s)]
*  I was running an investment fund successful, I had dinner with Obama, but it was under [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=216.32s)]
*  the purpose of should I donate to the foundation? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=221.4s)]
*  So he did have access, just not constant any moment you want pay to play access under Obama. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=223.48s)]
*  So he just wants to be able to be part of the administration basically because that's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=230.32s)]
*  what the Uber rich get now under the Trump administration is a free pass to be kind of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=233.48s)]
*  like a cosplaying member of the government. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=239.24s)]
*  Flagrant co-host Akash Singh had a compelling counterpoint to that argument, which Paula [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  Patia did not take kindly to. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=246.84s)]
*  Sorry, devil's advocate. Should being a mega donor, I mean, I guess I get your point of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  view, but couldn't it also just be like, no, we're not going to be biased just because [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=253.96s)]
*  a person donated money. We're not going to answer the phone whenever he calls. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=257.44s)]
*  You think I was like, you know, stupid five years ago and all of a sudden tried to like [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  to build national champions like now. Dude, man, I've been in the grind for 25 years here [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=267.84s)]
*  paying my taxes. I paid, you know, more than most people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=273.08s)]
*  Yeah. So irrespective of the donation, I've been trying to do the right thing. Yeah. I [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=276.52s)]
*  wasn't trying to favor myself. It's like even just to explain, like, here's what's happening [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=281.52s)]
*  on the ground. Do you want to know? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  Here's what's happening on the ground with the ultra wealthy. Do you want to know? Do [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=289.0s)]
*  you even care? My yacht broke down last week. It's almost like it doesn't bother you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  That's where that is, Cenk. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=298.44s)]
*  Yeah, he got touchy there on a very normal question. I mean, that brother asked that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=300.44s)]
*  question on behalf of America, right? And he's like, do you think I'm stupid? But nobody [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=305.68s)]
*  said you were stupid. I've been working really hard. God bless your heart. Nobody disputed [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=310.98s)]
*  that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=315.64s)]
*  We're just saying, you really think that if you're a donor, you should be able to call [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=316.64s)]
*  them anytime. Do you think that an average American is able to call the president or [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=319.68s)]
*  staffers at any time? Do you think it's a good idea that if you donate millions of dollars, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  that you'd be able to get access that no one else can get, and that you'd be able to push [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  your agenda and your businesses? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=332.76s)]
*  And you're saying, I'm telling you what's on the ground, and it might be helpful for [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=334.44s)]
*  it to hear from a small business owner or something to get their perspective. But are [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=337.84s)]
*  you small business owners? Because you have over a billion dollars, right? So your three [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  examples where I wanted to talk to the president, and so did another guy that I know that owns [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  this giant business around for 150 years, and so did my wife who also owns her business. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=354.92s)]
*  Well, good for you guys. Bless your hearts. Look, that's mainly a confession tape. And [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=360.8s)]
*  Obama looks better in that description than he's ever looked to me. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=368.16s)]
*  Having said that, now I'll add the second layer to it. So it's not but, it's and. All [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=374.0s)]
*  of that is 100% true. And I think what he was trying to say in the worst imaginable [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=379.35999999999996s)]
*  way is there's a certain arrogance to the Democratic politicians. And they really believe [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  they don't need to hear from anyone else. They're already geniuses. They are doing four-dimensional [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=393.55999999999995s)]
*  chess and everyone is beneath them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=398.84s)]
*  So whereas, okay, so Trump being open to the billionaire donors, I hate it. I mean, Jesus, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=404.67999999999995s)]
*  he put Elon Musk in charge of domestic policy, Mayor Maddison in charge of foreign policy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  I loathe it. It's the thing that I can't stand the most. Okay, but they're not just open [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=414.0s)]
*  to those donors. They're also open to all the online hosts and anyone that they think [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=419.08s)]
*  is relevant in any political context. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=425.56s)]
*  And like, I mean, Tim Poole's skating buddy can get a call in to the White House, right? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  Whereas with the Democrats, unless you have massive status, unless you're one of the elites, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=434.88s)]
*  the idea that they'd listen to you is just laughable. They would never listen to you [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=440.8s)]
*  because they already think that they walk on water. So and by the way, it's not like [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=445.68s)]
*  Democrats never used media. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=451.24s)]
*  I mean, they use MSNBC to push out their marketing, etc. Some now online influencers at the near [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=453.32s)]
*  the end of the Biden term. Sometimes they'll invite to the White House, etc. But the deal [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=460.64s)]
*  is always crystal clear. Anyone who objects to the administration in any way, shape or [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=464.72s)]
*  form is persona non grata. We won't listen to you. And the ones that don't object and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=470.64s)]
*  have come to the White House, we're not actually gonna listen to you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  You're gonna listen to us. We're gonna give you a message and you're going to say it, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=479.92s)]
*  period. This is not a conversation. We're the elites, we're geniuses and you aren't. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=485.64000000000004s)]
*  And that attitude is so toxic. And it's absolutely true. The only people I don't want them talking [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=491.2s)]
*  to is the donor class. But they should talk to everyone else. And unfortunately for Democrats, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=496.98s)]
*  they don't. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=501.88s)]
*  Jackson. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, other than the fact that they can and they're having more and more influence [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  over the laws written in the country. I don't really know why people like this bother being [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=511.04s)]
*  seen by the public. I mean, because even before this clip now where he was talking about the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=516.08s)]
*  access that he has, I don't care about the leaguers. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=521.48s)]
*  Nobody cares about that. So says you, speak for yourself. And even here, this guy just [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=525.02s)]
*  sounded and he's a great representation of all the people, all these billionaires, all [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=531.4s)]
*  these 100 millionaires who particularly the ones who donate to federal politicians and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=537.4s)]
*  the PACs and stuff. He just sounded completely self-absorbed. What happens in the country [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=542.64s)]
*  should be about making him comfortable. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=548.9s)]
*  I don't like the way I spend all this time at these dinners. I donate and they don't [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=550.64s)]
*  even pick up the phone for me. But Trump, yeah, they pick up the phone for me. And it's [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=554.48s)]
*  just like, that's about you. That's not about the country. You know what I mean? That's not [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=558.4s)]
*  about the people at large, but that's how this country operates. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=562.88s)]
*  And that's why the corruption and the money in politics is the biggest issue because these [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  people are comfortable up there. He was talking as if he knows the type of power he has. Look [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=569.76s)]
*  at Elon Musk. Look at all the stuff that he's doing and he feels like he's untouchable. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=575.8000000000001s)]
*  These people know the type of influence and power that they really have over what goes [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  down here. But again, I don't really know why they bother being seen by the public because [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=582.72s)]
*  they don't look good. They look like, to me that was F all of y'all. That's what it's [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  felt like to me. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=592.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  Watching that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=594.8399999999999s)]
*  No, no, Jackson, two great points there. Just build on it for one second here. It's the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=595.8399999999999s)]
*  entitlement, right? And so they feel entitled to be able to tell the president what to do. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=600.52s)]
*  And so yeah, it's generally true for a lot of the rich or the mega rich, right? But especially [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=606.56s)]
*  Silicon Valley. Those guys think that they walk on water and they're like, what do you [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=613.16s)]
*  mean? I worked hard. I already have over a billion dollars. I'm one of the demigods. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=617.8s)]
*  You listen to me and you shut up about it. I'm entitled to have the president. No, brother, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=623.24s)]
*  nobody's entitled to this. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=628.0799999999999s)]
*  There's 330 million people in the country. Nobody's entitled to talk to the president. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  And then that arrogant attitude of like, you should hear from me. Why do they, basically [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=633.12s)]
*  what Jackson is saying is, look guys, you already did whatever you did. Take the money [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  and run, right? Like what are you rubbing it in people's face and getting yourself in [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=646.8s)]
*  trouble for almost, right? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=650.24s)]
*  And the reason Jackson is because they can't help it because their egos are gigantic. And [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  they think, look, honestly, I read a bunch of stuff about Silicon Valley. And there was [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=658.0s)]
*  such a gold rush there. I mean, so appropriate for that location. That like, rug shop owners [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=664.48s)]
*  were stumbling over half a billion dollars, right? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=672.36s)]
*  Any like everybody was starting businesses and all the businesses were getting to monster [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=675.88s)]
*  valuations. And so what all of the geniuses in the world were in Silicon Valley? No, there's [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=680.52s)]
*  sometimes locations where there's enormous opportunity. Like bankers in New York, even [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=686.16s)]
*  in an earlier generation bankers in London, and now in tech executives in Silicon Valley. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=692.88s)]
*  But they don't think, hey, I was at the right place at the right time. They think, I'm a [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=698.12s)]
*  demigod. I'm a genius. And everyone should listen to me and do what I tell them to do. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=702.76s)]
*  And so they're not really familiar with the rest of the world. And so this is a bit of [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=709.76s)]
*  a rude awakening for him as he found out. Others don't agree with other, no. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=715.44s)]
*  To the point you made earlier, Cenk, somehow that still makes the Trump administration [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  come off as more accessible to actual people and relatable. Because at least they're giving [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=725.8s)]
*  access to some people who happen in the sort of in the cases he's talking about will call [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=731.3199999999999s)]
*  attention to the effects of their tariffs on people's businesses, on the effects of [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=736.16s)]
*  cutting R&D budgets of certain drugs that they might not be aware of when they're haphazardly [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=740.72s)]
*  cutting and somehow make the Democrats look even more out of touch. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=745.36s)]
*  Instead of being, one of the good things Obama used to do or claim he did was read 10 letters [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=749.4s)]
*  every night from regular Americans. But we don't have that ethos, the Democratic Party [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=753.76s)]
*  rather doesn't have that ethos anymore. They have the vibe of we know what's best. We don't [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=759.0s)]
*  need to hear from anybody. And so Trump somehow sounds more relatable and that's how he wins [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=763.08s)]
*  these elections. He seems like he's a man of the people, even if those people are the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=767.6800000000001s)]
*  ultra wealthy. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=771.2s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=772.6s)]
*  keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF00wZDlpDA&t=776.96s)]
