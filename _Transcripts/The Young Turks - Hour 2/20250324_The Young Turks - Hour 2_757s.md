TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Trump's Border Czar Shrugs Off Due Process Concerns of Deported Migrants
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM)
*  What we've heard from lawyers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=0.0s)]
*  representing some of these people [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=1.8s)]
*  is that they deny that they're [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=3.96s)]
*  members of this gang, or [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=6.04s)]
*  either Trent DeAragua or MS-13. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=7.7s)]
*  Do they get a chance to prove that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  before you take them out of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=12.52s)]
*  the country and put them in to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=14.42s)]
*  a notorious prison in a country [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=16.54s)]
*  that they're not even from? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=18.8s)]
*  I mean, do they have any due [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=21.14s)]
*  process at all? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=22.64s)]
*  Look, due process, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=23.28s)]
*  where's Lakerani's due process? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  There's something with Jonathan [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=30.48s)]
*  Carle there because he had a few [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=32.22s)]
*  contentious interviews. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=33.8s)]
*  But this was the one with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=35.24s)]
*  Tom Homan, the Trump border czar. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=36.84s)]
*  Happened yesterday, ABC's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=39.4s)]
*  Jonathan Carle got into a back and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=40.84s)]
*  forth about the migrants that were [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  recently deported to the terrorist [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=44.36s)]
*  confinement center, a notoriously [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=46.32s)]
*  brutal prison in El Salvador. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=48.64s)]
*  And I guess, Cenk, the question is, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  do Homan's comments seem like [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  a sound legal argument to you? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=56.56s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=60.12s)]
*  So guys, there's a couple of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=61.28s)]
*  different issues in this story. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=62.84s)]
*  One is, should we be deporting [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=64.72s)]
*  these people at all to El Salvador? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=67.04s)]
*  It's one thing to deport them back [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=69.64s)]
*  to their own country after you've [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=71.64s)]
*  gone through due process. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=73.68s)]
*  It's another thing to deport them [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=75.36s)]
*  to a different country with this [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=77.32s)]
*  jail, this prison that is absolutely [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=79.16s)]
*  brutal and filled with torture. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=81.32s)]
*  But the second issue is more [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=83.28s)]
*  important, which is due process. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=85.32s)]
*  Do we even know we got the right [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=88.44s)]
*  guys? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=89.92s)]
*  And at least one of them seems [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=90.42s)]
*  like no, we didn't. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=92.08s)]
*  That's a massive problem. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  So Sharon, tell us more about that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=94.84s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=97.32s)]
*  If you recall, federal judge named [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=98.12s)]
*  James Boesberg issued a written [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=100.56s)]
*  order stating that the Trump [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=102.72s)]
*  administration needed to keep [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=104.72s)]
*  the migrants in the United States. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=106.92s)]
*  Seems pretty clear. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=109.52s)]
*  Boesberg wanted to determine [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=111.08s)]
*  whether or not the administration [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=112.8s)]
*  properly used the Alien Enemies Act [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=114.8s)]
*  1998 to deport them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  But the migrants were deported [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  anyway. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump administration states that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=122.64s)]
*  the planes carrying the migrants [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  left US soil by the time the judges [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=126.5s)]
*  written order was published. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=128.52s)]
*  Omen had recently stated that he [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  didn't care what judges think. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's watch Jonathan Karl press [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=134.36s)]
*  Omen on those words. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't care about that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  Judges think as far as this case, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=139.96s)]
*  we're going to continue to arrest [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  public safety threats and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=143.36s)]
*  national security threats. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=144.56s)]
*  We're going to continue to deport [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=145.92s)]
*  them from the United States. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=147.2s)]
*  I understand this case is in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=148.56s)]
*  litigation to the Alien Enemies Act [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=149.84s)]
*  and will abide by the court order [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=151.76s)]
*  as litigated. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=154.2s)]
*  But my quote was, despite what he [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=155.28s)]
*  thinks, we're going to keep [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=157.48s)]
*  targeting the worst of the worst, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=159.48s)]
*  which we've been doing since day [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=161.76s)]
*  one in deporting from the United [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=163.2s)]
*  States through the various laws on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  the books. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=166.28s)]
*  We're not making this up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=167.12s)]
*  The Alien Enemies Act was actually [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=168.28s)]
*  a federal law. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=169.76s)]
*  It's the statutes enacted by [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=170.32s)]
*  Congress and signed by a president. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=172.0s)]
*  Now that's under litigation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=173.4s)]
*  But you're going to abide by court [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  orders as long as the and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=176.88s)]
*  go through your appeals process, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=178.32s)]
*  but you are not going to defy [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=180.44s)]
*  those orders. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=182.04s)]
*  No. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=184.76s)]
*  I mean, the pause is everything [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=187.76s)]
*  This morning, Judge Boasberg [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=188.84s)]
*  denied the Trump administration's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=190.48s)]
*  attempt to dissolve his order that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=192.56s)]
*  blocked those deportations. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=194.48s)]
*  Some of the migrants are stating [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  that they were wrongfully deported [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  because they have no affiliation [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=200.56s)]
*  to Venezuela or MS-13. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=203.28s)]
*  Here's one of them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=205.28s)]

*  our client worked in the arts in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=210.16s)]
*  Venezuela. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  He is LGBTQ. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  His tattoos are benign, but [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=214.88s)]
*  I submitted photos of his tattoos [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=216.64s)]

*  So that prison is out of control [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=496.8s)]

*  yes, of course we should. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=519.04s)]

*  the wrong guy. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=535.72s)]
*  So, I mean, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=536.96s)]
*  look at Toman's answers there. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=537.52s)]
*  Number one, he's so [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=539.52s)]

*  the court says. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=541.96s)]

*  the order. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=544.12s)]
*  But by the way, they didn't. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=544.64s)]
*  The judge said, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=546.68s)]
*  turn the plane around. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=547.52s)]
*  You don't have permission to send [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=549.2s)]
*  them to that country. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=550.64s)]
*  You went through absolutely no due [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=551.68s)]
*  process. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=553.52s)]

*  plane. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=555.36s)]
*  And you've proven a single thing [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=555.96s)]
*  about anybody on that plane. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=557.36s)]

*  if you're conservative, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=559.84s)]

*  undocumented immigrant crime, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=563.92s)]
*  okay, I get it, brothers and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=565.48s)]
*  sisters. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=566.88s)]
*  But if you let them do this without [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=567.64s)]
*  due process, and without double [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=570.4399999999999s)]

*  any way, shape or form, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=576.24s)]

*  anyone on that plane? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=580.52s)]
*  No check at all. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=582.32s)]
*  They could put anyone on a plane [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=584.44s)]
*  to a hellhole in El Salvador and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=586.6400000000001s)]
*  go, I don't know, man, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=588.9200000000001s)]

*  No, not remotely convincing. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=592.0s)]
*  And he, Holman says there, well, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=594.6800000000001s)]
*  maybe they weren't on a terrorist [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  list or maybe even a gang list. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=598.44s)]
*  But we know, we're sure. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=600.84s)]
*  Well, okay, that's why we have [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=603.88s)]
*  courts, because if you know and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=605.32s)]
*  you're sure, you bring that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=606.7600000000001s)]
*  evidence to a court and they go, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  you're right, okay, go ahead. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=609.5200000000001s)]
*  But they're not sure, that's why [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=611.4s)]
*  they didn't bring it to the courts. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=613.24s)]
*  So right now they're in the process [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=615.36s)]

*  without showing me that they're [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=627.1600000000001s)]
*  actually deserve it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=629.0400000000001s)]
*  They're now going to hold hearings [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=630.28s)]
*  about him in Congress. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=633.12s)]
*  Like how dare you actually try to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=635.2s)]

*  Trump's immigration policy, and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  how you feel about it one way or [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=648.8399999999999s)]

*  system. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=654.64s)]

*  We don't have to actually prove [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=658.4799999999999s)]
*  anything. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  We could just make unilateral [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=660.88s)]

*  so what? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=664.28s)]
*  How many people are we going to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1O2V8gP8fM&t=665.64s)]
