Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# EXPLAINED: Trump's Crypto Strategic Reserve
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA)
*  Today I am announcing that if I am elected it will be the policy of my administration, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=0.0s)]
*  United States of America, to keep 100% of all the Bitcoin the US government currently [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=7.0s)]
*  holds or acquires into the future. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=13.72s)]
*  We'll keep 100%, I hope you do well, please. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=16.56s)]
*  This will serve in effect as the core of the strategic national Bitcoin stockpile. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=21.6s)]
*  Last year, President Donald Trump stated that if elected, he would create a Bitcoin stockpile. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=28.92s)]
*  Well on Sunday, he actually took a step further by pledging to make a cryptocurrency strategic [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=36.92s)]
*  reserve, which is a bit of a disaster if you don't want US taxpayer money to be wasted [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=43.660000000000004s)]
*  on something that is utterly useless. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=49.44s)]
*  Now here's what he wrote on Truth Social. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  A US crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=54.31999999999999s)]
*  the Biden administration, which is why my executive order on digital assets directed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  the presidential working group to move forward on a crypto strategic reserve that includes [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=65.92s)]
*  XRP, SOL and ADA. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=71.52s)]
*  So those are Solana, Cardano, and XRP is another cryptocurrency. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=75.68s)]
*  And basically, he wants to, I will make sure the US is the crypto capital of the world, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  we are making America great again. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=92.42000000000002s)]
*  Are we making America great again with a crypto reserve, Cenk? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=94.04s)]
*  No, we're not. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  We're getting ready for a robbery of the American people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=98.44000000000001s)]
*  So let's review a couple of quick things. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=102.04s)]
*  The ones that outside of Bitcoin are smaller and more recent, and especially the last ones [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  that were mentioned by Anna. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=112.8s)]
*  And they have a smaller number of original founder starters, whichever lingo you want [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=116.04s)]
*  to use. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=121.56s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=122.72s)]
*  That means some people argued in the crypto industry to only use Bitcoin for the reserve [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=123.72s)]
*  because it's the oldest, most well-established, most decentralized, etc., right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=129.48s)]
*  But a lot of these newer ones got thrown in. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=135.72s)]
*  I'd be shocked if there were Trump donors among the people who hold a huge portion of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=137.56s)]
*  the smaller ones that he put in. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=147.0s)]
*  I'm of course kidding. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=149.28s)]
*  Of course, there's gonna be Trump donors all over those things and get what happened. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=150.52s)]
*  Okay, their crypto, their valuation is gonna go up. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=155.2s)]
*  Of course it did. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=158.52s)]
*  And so, but most importantly, as we discuss this, I want you to keep asking, wait, I'm [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  old enough to remember when the crypto guys said they didn't want any government involvement. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=166.52s)]
*  No, no, they want government involvement if it inflates the value of their useless cryptocurrency. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  No, yeah, they do now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=177.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  But I'm saying when they started, their whole shtick was we don't need no stinking government. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  We're gonna be decentralized. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=185.46s)]
*  We're gonna be deregulated, unregulated, and that's the best. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=187.02s)]
*  We don't want your stupid government hands on our beautiful crypto. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=195.46s)]
*  Now all your grubby fingers are into taxpayers' money, and now all of a sudden you love the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=196.46s)]
*  government? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=200.78s)]
*  All of a sudden you want the government to back up your load of crap. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  I thought you didn't want the government. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  Why don't you just go away? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  Go do it on your own, lose your own goddamn money. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=210.52s)]
*  You know you're gonna rob Bob and Sally in the middle of the country by creating this [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=213.14s)]
*  reserve, and what are we buying? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=217.66s)]
*  We're buying your crap. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=220.5s)]
*  Well, I don't want your crap. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=221.5s)]
*  What are we gonna do with it? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=222.82s)]
*  What is this crypto even useful for? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=224.54s)]
*  Honestly, honestly, the whole point of this crypto reserve, again, is to inflate the value [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=226.89999999999998s)]
*  of this cryptocurrency. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=233.77999999999997s)]
*  That's all this is about. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  So look, let's just quickly highlight the difference between stockpile and reserve, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=236.98s)]
*  because there is an important difference between the two. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=242.68s)]
*  So a crypto stockpile would mean that the government would just simply hold on to the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=244.36s)]
*  crypto that it has right now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=248.56s)]
*  And according to data from a crypto firm called 21Co, the US government currently has about [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=251.1s)]
*  $18 billion worth of Bitcoin that it had actually taken from criminals and illegal markets, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=259.42s)]
*  okay? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=266.32s)]
*  the Bitcoin is seized as part of the investigation process to reimburse victims or pay for agency [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=267.54s)]
*  expenses. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=275.52s)]
*  But if the United States government sets up a crypto reserve, then the government would [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=276.76s)]
*  also buy crypto at regular intervals. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=281.2s)]
*  So Trump's announcement made crypto prices skyrocket. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, that's the whole point of this crypto reserve. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=288.36s)]
*  There's no other point to it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=291.6s)]
*  Bitcoin rose about 10% to about $94,000 per coin as of late Sunday afternoon. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=293.56s)]
*  XRP jumped up about 32%. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=301.4s)]
*  Solana, the underlying blockchain platform for what are known as meme coins, including [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=305.68s)]
*  the president's official Trump token, rose 26%. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=311.96s)]
*  The Trump coin was up more than 34%. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  Wait a minute, hold on. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=319.88s)]
*  So we need to gut the federal government because of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=321.56s)]
*  But we're gonna spend $100 billion on Bitcoin that not only makes these cryptocurrency goons [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=325.72s)]
*  wealthy but it makes Trump wealthier. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=331.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=333.68s)]
*  Funnel our taxpayer money right into Donald Trump's pocket. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=334.68s)]
*  And not just Bitcoin, we're spending it on that company that his dumb ass fraudulent [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=337.42s)]
*  meme coin is in. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=344.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=345.0s)]
*  Meme coins are by definition worthless. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=346.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=348.08s)]
*  Look guys, again, you're MAGA and you wanna waste your own money, you wanna burn it, no [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  problem. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=356.24s)]
*  It's a free country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=357.24s)]
*  And I have people in my comment section on X that say like, yeah, so what? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=358.24s)]
*  Yeah, I wanna buy it and I don't mind if it goes down. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=362.84s)]
*  I don't mind if Trump takes my money. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=365.76s)]
*  Great. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=366.76s)]
*  Okay, you do you boo. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=367.76s)]
*  But don't touch our taxpayer money and funnel it into cryptocurrency. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=368.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, you wanna lose your own money, that's up to you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=372.4s)]
*  You wanna make money, I don't care. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=375.64s)]
*  I'm rooting for you, okay? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=377.32s)]
*  But when you say, I'm gonna take from the average American that has nothing to do with [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  crypto, and I'm gonna make them put $100 billion of their money in exchange where you're crypto [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=384.68s)]
*  crap. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  And then when you said you didn't want the government involved, and then say, well, if [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=392.04s)]
*  it goes down, ha ha ha ha, the American taxpayer got screwed, ha ha ha ha. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=397.72s)]
*  No, I'm not interested in it, I'm not. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=402.04s)]
*  So this is just a robbery. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=404.76s)]
*  There's no reserve for what? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzrFYdpmMA&t=406.76s)]
