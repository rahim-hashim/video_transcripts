"Fox News host Laura Ingraham pressed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem several times as to whether she would ‚Äúgo after‚Äù blue state governors and mayors who interfere with undocumented migrant raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, eventually telling her, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking a question because I expect an answer.‚Äù*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Kristi Noem Can't Stop Cosplaying on National TV
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk)
*  Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary Noem, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=0.0s)]
*  How soon will Gitmo be ready? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=4.64s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is catching some heat for showing up to a Fox [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  News interview in a full Border Patrol outfit. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=11.96s)]
*  She also wore full ICE attire in this extremely brief video she posted on social media earlier [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=16.72s)]
*  this week. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=22.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=23.52s)]
*  You're in New York City this morning, we are getting the dirtbags off these streets. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=24.52s)]
*  Now here's a picture of that fit. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=28.28s)]
*  Just ridiculous. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  Now Noem will be joining Meet the Press for an interview this Sunday. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  Cenk, any bets on whether she'll be wearing her full Border Patrol outfit for that hit? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=38.08s)]
*  Okay, we're back to outfits. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  So look, I'm gonna surprise you guys a little bit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=48.32s)]
*  I think that there's some political value in it now, but it does look goofy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Okay, and Jordan, don't show her your hat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=57.0s)]
*  She's gonna want that hat. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  She's gonna go, yeah, I'm the baddie, not Jordan Yule. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  So anyways, real quick on this, I'm gonna get to Wazz and then come back to why I think [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=65.68s)]
*  that it might be a little bit effective. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=70.68s)]
*  But there's an old story that's actually in my book, Justice is Coming, about how Chris [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  Matthews used to love it when the politicians played dress up. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=76.88s)]
*  He was a huge host on MSNBC back in the day. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  And when George Bush dressed up as a pilot and landed the jet before the mission accomplished [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=84.0s)]
*  speech, it was the worst moment of his presidency. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  He said he regretted it later because the mission was not accomplished. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  It was two months into the Iraq War. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=99.68s)]
*  Chris Matthews on air, he's like, look at him, he looks so good. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=102.12s)]
*  He looks like a pilot, jet fighter pilot, he's amazing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=104.72s)]
*  And he's like, he's like the cop, you need that cop on the beat, you need it, okay? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=108.36000000000001s)]
*  And then they have all, and he went through all these characters. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=113.6s)]
*  He's like, Fred Thompson, who was a literal actor, by the way, then ran and won as Republican [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  Senator from Tennessee. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=121.8s)]
*  He would be, this is my favorite story, you've probably heard a couple times if you watched [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=123.28s)]
*  a long time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=126.0s)]
*  He would go to events in his limo and then get in a red pickup truck and drive around [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=127.0s)]
*  the red pickup truck. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=132.88s)]
*  And the press would never report the limo that he came in, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=134.04s)]
*  And so Chris Matthews was like, now you see that, Fred Thompson, he looks like a man's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  man. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  He's got some aquavelva on him. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=143.08s)]
*  I'm like, did you smell him? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=145.8s)]
*  Okay, so this is the kind of coverage that used to be around in this mainstream media [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=148.36s)]
*  crap, like this dribble. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  So that's why they play dress up, because the media loves it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=155.9s)]
*  So I'm gonna get to why I think it might be an okay idea, actually, believe it or not, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  now that we're back into this era. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  But Waz, what did you think? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  It definitely feels like it's of a piece with all the things that's happening around the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump regime within the first 10 days or whatever it's been, even though it's felt [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=170.2s)]
*  like an eternity already. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think so much of what they're doing is messaging to the public. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  It's signaling, even if they're not getting that much done. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=182.66s)]
*  I think they've deported like a thousand people so far and they claim that there's 20 million [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=187.72s)]
*  illegals. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=193.12s)]
*  You guys can even do the math on that in terms of percentage wise of people that have been [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  deported. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=199.12s)]
*  There's just a level of messaging and PR, if you will, that the Trump and all of their [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=200.12s)]
*  people are engaged with in terms of making the headlines. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=206.68s)]
*  And this lady, when she's dressed up in a uniform, she's trying to show people like, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=210.8s)]
*  I gotta point it to this cabinet position, and I'm taking it seriously. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=215.04s)]
*  I'm literally in it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=218.36s)]
*  I'm in a uniform, so I'm in the job, is what she's trying to express to people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=220.24s)]
*  Obviously, we don't fall for it cuz she looks ridiculous. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=226.08s)]
*  She looks like you would never actually be actually in that job, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=229.4s)]
*  Like knocking on doors and checking people's papers, you would never be in that job. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  But I think that's what she's trying to signal to folks, that she's literally embedded with [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  the folks that are going out and kicking out the immigrants who are allegedly ruining our [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=245.56s)]
*  great or our once great country. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=249.74s)]
*  And why do they need her there? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=252.3s)]
*  All she's gonna be is a distraction, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  Like, we gotta make sure the Department of Homeland Security secretary doesn't get hurt [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=257.14s)]
*  while she's posing for pictures. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=263.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=264.54s)]
*  Morale for the troops, Jay, come on, man. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=265.54s)]
*  Everybody wants to see the leader on the front lines with you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=267.44s)]
*  The dress up is always really funny to me. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  The Jared Kushner one, when he went to the Middle East in a suit and had that tiny bulletproof [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  jacket. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=281.86s)]
*  That was- Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=283.06s)]
*  That was a great one. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=284.06s)]
*  And of course, it could go bad. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=285.7s)]
*  Dukakis in the helmet got widely panned. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=287.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=289.66s)]
*  But every time I see Kristi Noem, and here is no exception, all I could think about is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=290.66s)]
*  Jessica Burbank. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=296.7s)]
*  And this is just Jessica Burbank's evil twin. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=297.7s)]
*  It should have been separated at birth. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=301.18s)]
*  I don't know about that, Jessica. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=302.54s)]
*  I don't know how you take that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=305.54s)]
*  I've told her that, so I'm not talking about her behind her back. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=308.82s)]
*  But all I could see whenever I see Kristi Noem now, it's like- [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=311.16s)]
*  So funny. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=313.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=314.44s)]
*  Okay, by the way, Jessica- Evil Burbank. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=315.44s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=316.44s)]
*  Jessica's at DropSight News, check that out. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=317.44s)]
*  So look, the reason why I get the value of it is because Trump did this at McDonald's. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=321.44s)]
*  He did it with the garbage truck, if you remember, at the end. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=327.3s)]
*  Look, people like to see things with their own eyes and go, okay, I can relate to him. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=330.68s)]
*  He looks like a guy who works at McDonald's, whether that makes sense or not, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=335.0s)]
*  And so it's some old school politics, even without the mainstream media fluffing you, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=338.76s)]
*  which each side has their own fluffers, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=343.88s)]
*  But overall, what the message that they're sending, which they're shouting it is, we're [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=348.48s)]
*  on the job. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=353.88s)]
*  We're doing things for you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=355.76s)]
*  And the Democrats could use a little bit of that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=358.52s)]
*  Like Joe Biden came in, first interview, he was like, I can't do $15 minimum wage. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=367.88s)]
*  The parliamentarian, the filibuster, I can't do anything. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=368.88s)]
*  Don't blame me, there was nothing I could do. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, I don't know, put on an outfit, get out there in the streets, do something. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=375.28s)]
*  Get caught trying. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=380.4s)]
*  That's been one of the biggest contrasts for me personally, guys, is Trump and his cronies [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=381.96s)]
*  being like, look, we had four years to prepare for this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=388.24s)]
*  And then just throwing the book at everything and the Democrats being scared of a parliamentarian [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=391.4s)]
*  who nobody had ever heard of before. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=396.24s)]
*  I never heard of this job until the Democrats made it the most powerful position in Washington. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=398.24s)]
*  Yeah, I got a good way of keeping everybody sober. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=404.92s)]
*  Let's play a drinking game. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=407.96s)]
*  You drink every time anyone in media or politics says parliamentarian in the next four years. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=409.36s)]
*  You won't have a drink, all the problems will be solved because nobody's gonna say, it's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=415.4s)]
*  only when Democrats are in charge. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=418.96s)]
*  They're like, my God, the parliamentarian, he runs the whole world and we can't do anything [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=420.6s)]
*  because of the parliamentarian. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=423.92s)]
*  That's such an obvious excuse, right? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=425.48s)]
*  That's true, under Biden it was a sheep. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIOcduCkEk&t=428.2s)]
