"Republican influencer Ashley St. Clair lashed out at billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk on Monday amid an ongoing dispute over whether Musk is the father of St. Clair‚Äôs child.

After St. Clair was filmed selling her $100,000 Tesla car in an effort to ‚Äúmake up for the 60% cut that Elon made to our son‚Äôs child support,‚Äù Musk responded, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if the child is mine or not, but am not against finding out. No court order is needed. Despite not knowing for sure, I have given Ashley $2.5M and am sending her $500k/year.‚Äù

# Elon's Alleged Baby Mama Puts Him On BLAST
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo)
*  What did you like about having kids? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, I think kids are delightful. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=2.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=4.0s)]
*  What's delightful about them? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=6.0s)]
*  Because they get a bad rap, man. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=8.0s)]
*  So, what did you find delightful about them? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=10.0s)]
*  I mean, I think you, we are, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=16.0s)]
*  I mean, most people, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=18.0s)]
*  best charted people are, you know, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=20.0s)]
*  are going to love their kids. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=22.0s)]
*  And it's like a little loved one. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=24.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a good deal. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=26.0s)]
*  I want to love you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=28.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=29.0s)]
*  Kids, if you give them the chance. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=30.0s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=32.0s)]
*  Now, Elon Musk, father of 14, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=34.0s)]
*  that's a lot of kids, claims to love all his children. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=36.0s)]
*  But does he? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=40.0s)]
*  Because according to one of the women who has allegedly procreated with him, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=42.0s)]
*  no, not so much. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=47.0s)]
*  There's one child that he's kind of in denial about. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=49.0s)]
*  So, according to MAGA influencer and Elon's latest baby mama, Ashley St. Clair, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=51.0s)]
*  it's not the case that he loves all his kids because he has now cut her off. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=57.0s)]
*  Meaning, he has cut one of his children off of receiving some financial assistance from their father. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=62.0s)]
*  And he's the richest man in the world. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=70.0s)]
*  He's reducing his child support payments. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=72.0s)]
*  And he's forcing the poor mother of his child to sell her Tesla. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=74.0s)]
*  This story, there's no one good in this story. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=80.0s)]
*  Everyone is bad, okay? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=83.0s)]
*  And presumably the kid. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=85.0s)]
*  No, no, not the kid, not the kid. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=87.0s)]
*  Is good, I mean. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=88.0s)]
*  A little baby, okay, a little baby. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=89.0s)]
*  We gotta protect the little baby. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=91.0s)]
*  Kids are good. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=92.0s)]
*  Kids wanna live, they wanna love you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=93.0s)]
*  If you give them the chance. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=95.0s)]
*  Sorry, my jacket's too normal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=98.0s)]
*  I can't sell that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=100.0s)]
*  So look, there's a lot of allegations that Ashley St. Clair is like a gold digger. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=102.0s)]
*  And I don't know if she's a gold digger. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=107.0s)]
*  Okay, I have no idea. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=108.0s)]
*  But what I do know is that Elon Musk was paying her $500,000 to probably keep quiet about this whole situation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=109.0s)]
*  And she didn't. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=118.0s)]
*  How much money? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=119.0s)]
*  Half a million dollars a year. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=120.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=122.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=124.0s)]
*  It's a lot of money. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=126.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is actually. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=127.0s)]
*  I don't know if I would have his baby for that money. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=129.0s)]
*  But that's a lot of money. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=131.0s)]
*  And so let's get to more details about what happened here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=133.0s)]
*  Because she's saying he is cutting down the child support payments as punishment to teach her a lesson. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=136.0s)]
*  So a Daily Mail reporter caught up with St. Clair outside of her Manhattan apartment this past weekend where she was selling her $100,000 Tesla Model S. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=144.0s)]
*  Stating quote, I need to make up for the 60% cut that Elon made to our son's child support. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=153.0s)]
*  When asked if this was Musk being vindictive, St. Clair went on to say that it was his modus operandi, which I totally believe. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=161.0s)]
*  She says that he doesn't like when women speak out against him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=172.0s)]
*  She also claimed that she hasn't spoken to him since February 13th, the day before all this drama went down. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=175.0s)]
*  I hate everybody involved in this situation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=182.0s)]
*  I hate that this is being aired out publicly. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=189.0s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=194.0s)]
*  There's a kid involved. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=197.0s)]
*  I hate that he's just having kids left and right with various women. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=198.0s)]
*  And for some reason, his reputation isn't suffering from that at all. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=202.0s)]
*  It's super irresponsible. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=208.0s)]
*  These are real kids. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=209.0s)]
*  Look, it's one thing if you've had a family that marriage falls apart for whatever reason. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=211.0s)]
*  You find love again and you have a child with your new wife. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=217.0s)]
*  Life happens and I'm not going to be judgmental toward people who find themselves in that situation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=220.0s)]
*  But this is not that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=225.0s)]
*  This is just being super irresponsible and having kids left and right with various women. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=227.0s)]
*  It's not okay. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=233.0s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=234.0s)]
*  I think most basically everything he does is irresponsible. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=236.0s)]
*  I think the one super responsible thing he's doing is not being in their lives because that would ruin them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=239.0s)]
*  And so I think that's nice of him. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=246.0s)]
*  It's uncharacteristically compassionate of him to not inflict himself on them as he inflicts himself on all of us. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=248.0s)]
*  So that's good. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=254.0s)]
*  I don't generally care too much about his kids or his relationships or whatever. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=256.0s)]
*  I mean, look, I think that if she's being honest and it is actually his kid, then she's owed, I would say, much more than the $500,000. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=260.0s)]
*  He has hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=269.0s)]
*  He could hand over millions to her, set the kid up for life. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=270.0s)]
*  I think so in that case, if she's being honest, then I think she's a good guy in this story. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=272.0s)]
*  I think that if she's not being honest and if she had the kid with another guy and she's lying, I think that she is my favorite person in the world. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=276.0s)]
*  I think she's the best person ever. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=284.0s)]
*  And I would encourage more women to lie about having kids with Elon Musk. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=286.0s)]
*  To steal money from him because I want to see that happen. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=289.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=291.0s)]
*  No, no, it's the best of both worlds because that way you get the money. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=292.0s)]
*  But you also have kids with a smarter, more physically impressive man. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=295.0s)]
*  I'm just playing the numbers randomly choose a guy and you're going to land with a comparative winner. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=299.0s)]
*  And so if she's being honest, she's fine. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=304.0s)]
*  She's a good guy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=306.0s)]
*  If she's lying. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=307.0s)]
*  Oh my God, John. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=309.0s)]
*  Please start lying about having kids with Elon Musk. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=311.0s)]
*  I cannot stress that enough. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=314.0s)]
*  You can't let hatred. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=315.0s)]
*  I'll be the first hatred of someone crush your soul into a dark. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=317.0s)]
*  It's too late. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=322.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=323.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=324.0s)]
*  It happened. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=325.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=326.0s)]
*  Well, I don't encourage any bad behavior here and there's already a lot of bad behavior to go around. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=327.0s)]
*  So in her original statement on X St. Clair stated five months ago, I welcomed a new baby into the world. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=332.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is the father. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=338.0s)]
*  I have not previously disclosed this to protect our child's privacy and safety. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=339.0s)]
*  Apparently that doesn't matter as much anymore. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=344.0s)]
*  But in recent days, it has become clear that tabloid media intends to do so regardless of the harm it'll cause. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=346.0s)]
*  Since we last talked about the story, St. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=352.0s)]
*  Clair has filed for sole custody of the child, which I don't think Elon is really poised to fight her on that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=355.0s)]
*  Seems like he doesn't care about his kid at all. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=362.0s)]
*  And Musk never even acknowledged fathering this child publicly and has even made some indication that he questions the paternity of the child. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=364.0s)]
*  But in text messages, St. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=375.0s)]
*  Clair attached to the court filing, Musk acknowledges it is his child while explaining why he is not on the birth certificate. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=377.0s)]
*  So Elon says, I get credible death threats every day. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=384.0s)]
*  I'm number two after Trump for assassination. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=388.0s)]
*  Wake up. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=391.0s)]
*  This is not the time for sentiment at the expense of safety. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=392.0s)]
*  If I make a mistake on security, baby's name will, you know, that's redacted, will never know his father. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=396.0s)]
*  St. Clair says that's why the father spot on the birth certificate is blank right now. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=403.0s)]
*  And why he has my last name. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=409.0s)]
*  And Elon says necessary. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=411.0s)]
*  I hate this. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=412.0s)]
*  I'm so pathetic. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=413.0s)]
*  So center with this constant. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=415.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to out me or off me stuff. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=416.0s)]
*  God, he's so pathetic. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=421.0s)]
*  I mean, John, when you make the kind of statements you made earlier, like I can understand why you would think that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=422.0s)]
*  That's encouraging people to lie about paternity. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=427.0s)]
*  That's a much lower level crime. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=429.0s)]
*  Okay, so St. Clair also wrote, I'm the only parent who cares for him on a daily basis. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=431.0s)]
*  I feed him, bathe him and ensure that all his physical and emotional needs are met by his choice. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=437.0s)]
*  Respondent Musk was not present for our for the birth of our child. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=443.0s)]
*  Has had no more than three in person visits with our child and has not expressed an interest in having custody of our child. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=448.0s)]
*  Now, as stated earlier, Elon does pay child support, but apparently not enough. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=456.0s)]
*  And so whatever, Laura Loomer has gotten involved and instead of maybe attacking the deadbeat dad in this situation, who's refusing to take responsibility for his own child. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=461.0s)]
*  She went after Ashley St. Clair, called her a gold digger, yada yada. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=473.0s)]
*  You get the point. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=476.0s)]
*  Look, there's a kid involved and all of this is super gross. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=477.0s)]
*  And if I were Ashley St. Clair, you're gonna be high. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=482.0s)]
*  I would cut Elon out of your life. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=486.0s)]
*  I would stop begging for money. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=488.0s)]
*  You are an able bodied young woman. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=490.0s)]
*  Go out there, earn a living. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=492.0s)]
*  I'm sure you're gonna be able to do it just fine. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=494.0s)]
*  Because having him involved in this conflict is not good for your kid. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=496.0s)]
*  So your kid should come first. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=501.0s)]
*  And in this case, I don't think that's what's happening. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=503.0s)]
*  I don't think either party seems really all that concerned about the kid. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=505.0s)]
*  I don't need to know about their swabbles. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=509.0s)]
*  Right, okay. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=511.0s)]
*  I would not have procreated with this guy. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=513.0s)]
*  No, that was a weird choice. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=515.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, she should do whatever she thinks she needs to do. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=517.0s)]
*  I don't really care what happens to any of them. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=519.0s)]
*  All right, well, you heard it here first, folks. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=521.0s)]
*  John does not care. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=524.0s)]
*  I would be happy to never have to think about any of them, the kid included. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6yILh7iFo&t=525.0s)]
