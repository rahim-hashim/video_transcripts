"Conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro pulled no punches on his show Monday in urging the American right and the MAGA movement to ‚Äúdump‚Äù Andrew Tate, following Trump‚Äôs lawyer and spokesperson Alina Habba praising him.

Shapiro explained that Habba and Tate spoke briefly while both were guests on Benny Johnson‚Äôs show last week and that their exchange ‚Äúerupted into a controversy.‚Äù Shapiro then played tape of Habba on Johnson‚Äôs controversial program."

# Ben Shapiro NUKES Andrew Tate
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s)
*  He's actually kind of an evil con artist, not kind of if you believe the allegations against him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=0.0s)]
*  And there are lots of them and actually evil con artists. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=4.64s)]
*  Ben Shapiro despises Andrew Tate. And as you saw in that video, he recently [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=7.68s)]
*  came out in a segment really calling Andrew Tate out. But more importantly, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=16.96s)]
*  encouraging the right wing to drop Andrew Tate entirely. They're really at each other's throats. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=22.48s)]
*  And once again, as they battle for the fate of the conservative movement, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=29.44s)]
*  let's see who ends up winning. Now look, we're gonna start with how their latest fight started, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=33.92s)]
*  what sparked the latest beef. But before we get to Ben's take and Andrew Tate's response, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  it's important to know that all of this started when Trump lawyer Alina Jaba [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  and Tate both appeared on the Benny Johnson show. So let's see what happened next. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=52.08s)]
*  Nice to meet you. I'm a big fan. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=56.88s)]
*  Well, nice to meet you. I'm a fan. You're the one saving Trump. You're doing more important work [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=60.96s)]
*  than me. America, America, not just Trump. And I agree with everything you just said. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=65.12s)]
*  And I think that your anger is the same that President Trump has for our country. And [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  the time is now for us to stop being wimps. I think that's exactly the right sentiment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=77.68s)]
*  And I also have to say that I sympathize with you because I think you go through [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=82.4s)]
*  a lot of the same, show me the person, I'll find the crime that President Trump has gone through. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  He was arrested for human trafficking in Romania. You're a big fan? Okay. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=92.4s)]
*  John, any thoughts before we go to Shapiro's reaction? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=103.76s)]
*  Yeah, she's utter garbage, as so many people in that movement are. She knows who he is. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  And she thinks that their movement needs guys like him. They think that- [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=111.68s)]
*  They don't. Yeah, and they think that, well, we need to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=115.76s)]
*  wreck young men, set them on a path of following our media figures and our politicians for the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  rest of their life. Andrew Tate seems to be pretty good at getting guys into the endless vortex of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=127.84s)]
*  victimhood and hating women and all that. And they're likely to be supporters of ours for [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=135.12s)]
*  a long time. And so she's sucking up to him. And whoever the host is, he's weirdly smiling [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=139.6s)]
*  about the thing that he's set up here. The entire thing is utterly grotesque. And it's weird to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=145.92s)]
*  agree so much with Ben Shapiro, but he's totally right. They should be better than this, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=150.56s)]
*  but they're clearly not. So Ben Shapiro did not shy away from his honest opinion about Andrew Tate. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=154.72s)]
*  And to be fair, he has gone after Andrew Tate in the past as well. Ben Shapiro is a legitimate [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=160.56s)]
*  conservative. I mean, he literally wrote a whole book about how we should ban porn. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=168.0s)]
*  So he's not a fan of the grotesque exploitation of women and the sexual stuff. It certainly offends [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=172.64s)]
*  his sensibility. So it's not far-fetched for someone like Ben Shapiro to speak out against him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=184.8s)]
*  But here is the title and thumbnail from Ben Shapiro's stream on Monday. So he's got an image [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=188.4s)]
*  of Andrew Tate in the background with big bold red letters saying Con Artist. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=195.52s)]
*  And the title is The Right Should Dump Andrew Tate. Now during that show, Shapiro went on a nearly [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=201.12s)]
*  20-minute long tirade against Andrew Tate. And here are the highlights. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=207.28s)]
*  Andrew Tate is not brave and wonderful. He rips off thousands of people with his scam [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=211.6s)]
*  hustler's university. He preaches the virtue of treating women in a way you would never, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=217.04s)]
*  ever allow anyone to treat your wife or your daughter. If you're a person, for example, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=221.04s)]
*  who purports to stand for biblical values or American values or traditional values, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=225.04s)]
*  you probably have a moral obligation. I probably certainly have a moral obligation to ask Andrew [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=229.2s)]
*  Tate, who is a self-stated bad man, hard questions about his actions and his beliefs and his past. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=233.76s)]
*  Not to, as so many on the right have, help him falsely rewrite his legal record or ignore all [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=240.72s)]
*  the things he's actually said while nodding enthusiastically. Now, Andrew Tate plays a WWE [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=245.6s)]
*  heel. He knows it. I mean, he's not making any bones about this. He released a video yesterday, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=251.04s)]
*  a very long 21-minute video, rambling video, sitting in a jacuzzi in cold weather, smoking [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=254.24s)]
*  a hookah, and basically saying that he wants to be the most hated man on Earth and that he makes [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=258.72s)]
*  money off of that. And he's telling the truth about that. That part is true. He made his money [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=263.28s)]
*  grooming women for the industry. Now, all the people on the right who are very upset [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=267.52s)]
*  correctly about the grooming gangs in Britain are gonna have to explain why they're okay with [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=272.56s)]
*  his grooming gang. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=276.56s)]
*  But he makes good points there. There is a major flaw in the first part of that video compilation [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=277.52s)]
*  that we put together, and it has to do with Andrew Tate's treatment of women. While he does [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=286.88s)]
*  treat women poorly, so does the guy that Ben Shapiro is cheerleading, was cheerleading during [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=292.72s)]
*  the presidential race. I mean, you were kind of making that point as we were watching that video, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=300.24s)]
*  John. But overall, I mean, I largely agree with what Ben Shapiro is saying specifically about [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=304.48s)]
*  Andrew Tate. And I don't think you need to be a religious individual to see the deep character [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=309.04s)]
*  flaws of Andrew Tate. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and look, the agreement can also end at a certain point. He's against Andrew Tate, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  which is good. He also thinks that all pornography is basically the same thing as all that, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=324.24s)]
*  which I think is that utter madness. But that's fine. He's right about this. And he made some good [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=328.4s)]
*  points about like, cuz he went off in the extended video about like, obviously, I'm not saying don't [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=333.52s)]
*  have him on, have literally everyone, the worst people. Use your valuable time to bring on these [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=337.84s)]
*  terrible people because that's the position he has to have. But then he says in that video, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=343.44s)]
*  but then use that as an opportunity to ask them tough questions, which I think is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=348.32s)]
*  totally right. And he talked about how you wouldn't want your wife or your daughters to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=351.92s)]
*  be treated the way that Andrew Tate has made millions of dollars by advocating that men [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=358.24s)]
*  treat them. And someone in the audience brought this up and I fact checked it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=363.2s)]
*  The host of that podcast, it's bad enough, Alina Habas, like, yeah, yeah, no, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=367.04s)]
*  sexual slavery for women is awesome. I agree with everything you say. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=371.68s)]
*  The host of that show is Benny Johnson, apparently, who has two young daughters. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=374.72s)]
*  And as a father with a daughter, what kind of monster are you? You're cheerily, he's like all [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=380.56s)]
*  happy. Look what I've set up. I've got Andrew Tate. Oh, well, God, I'm getting some rub off of Andrew [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  Tate. And Andrew Tate is out there trying to raise a generation of men who think the way they should [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=393.76000000000005s)]
*  make a success out of themselves is to take my daughter and lock her into sexual slavery [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=400.0s)]
*  so I can extract all the money from it and get rich. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=406.96s)]
*  And this is the world I'm creating. No, I'm not even talking about the allegations of rape or [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=410.56s)]
*  whatever. This is what he advocates. No, you get these women, you get these vulnerable women. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=417.12s)]
*  Yes, he has said that on the record. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=421.36s)]
*  Make them do cam work and you take the money from them. And that is the world he wants to create. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=423.04s)]
*  And Benny Johnson's like, that's the world I want for my two young daughters. I'm not gonna check [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=428.4s)]
*  this guy. I'm not gonna ask him tough questions. No, I'm just gonna try to get a little bit of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=434.08s)]
*  notoriety off of him. Some clicks, maybe a little bit of super chats or something. That is monstrous. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  And Ben Shapiro is right to point it out. Now, Ben Shapiro isn't gonna call Benny Johnson out [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=443.12s)]
*  specifically for that. But it is clear that that's what the criticism is aimed at. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=448.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good point. I did not know that Benny Johnson has two daughters and that's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=453.12s)]
*  super discouraging considering who he's talking to. But Andrew Tate did respond to Shapiro [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=456.88s)]
*  with some allegations of his own. So let's take a look at that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=463.84s)]
*  Girls would sit there in grainy footage, 4AEP. You could barely see anything and sometimes [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=482.64s)]
*  they'd be topless. Yes, I've admitted it. I've talked about it at length. It's true. It's been [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=488.24s)]
*  a decade, but for some reason you wanna pretend that still stains my character and I'm a bad [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=491.68s)]
*  person and I'm a pornographer. How come you're still taking money from porn today? And let's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  talk about the thing I did, my E-Girls studio. You can compare that to Playboy. That is a girl [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=501.12s)]
*  sitting there with no top on. What you are doing, you are taking money from OnlyFans, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=506.4s)]
*  which is far more comparable to Pornhub, homosexuality, transsexuals. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=510.0s)]
*  Who's that woman who just slept with a thousand men in a day? That was all on OnlyFans to make [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=515.36s)]
*  money, which then goes to APAC to pay for you. That was what? That was the most bizarre rant [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=521.12s)]
*  I've heard in a long time. What does OnlyFans have to do with this? So I guess the argument that he's [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=532.8s)]
*  trying to make if I'm connecting the dots accurately, it's hard to follow his reasoning [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=539.84s)]
*  or logic here. But apparently OnlyFans funds APAC and APAC funds Ben Shapiro. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=545.44s)]
*  So Ben Shapiro is taking money from the porn industry. Is that what he's trying to argue here? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=554.8000000000001s)]
*  I have no idea, but he provided no proof that APAC is paying Ben Shapiro personally. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=558.88s)]
*  I think Ben Shapiro is a pro-Israel zealot all on his own. He doesn't need APAC to do that, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=564.0799999999999s)]
*  to pay for his talking points at all. And it is true that OnlyFans or the founder of OnlyFans [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=570.48s)]
*  gives a lot of money to APAC. But the connection to Ben Shapiro is very dubious here, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=578.64s)]
*  to say the least. John, any final thoughts on this? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=584.0s)]
*  I'm not familiar with any direct financial connection between APAC to Ben Shapiro. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=586.4s)]
*  I guess if that existed, then you could try to make that tortured weird metaphor wherein [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=591.92s)]
*  he tried to imply that the situation I set up for these women wasn't that bad because it wasn't even [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=598.08s)]
*  HD. It's only really immoral if it's broadcast in 4K. What are you talking about? And what is the, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=604.96s)]
*  I don't actually watch videos of him. What is the strange character he's playing? What voice [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=614.4s)]
*  and accent is he trying to do there? Is it supposed to be royalty or something? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  It certainly is. I know his brand is that he's this tough alpha male or whatever. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=625.12s)]
*  I don't even think he's aiming for that image anymore. He's certainly not achieving it with [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=630.88s)]
*  his weird squeaky voice, which seems so incongruous with everything else about the image he's trying [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=635.52s)]
*  to present. Yeah. Look, I give Ben Shapiro credit for calling Andrew Tate out. I side with Ben [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=640.96s)]
*  Shapiro way more in this specific cat fight than I do with Andrew Tate. We'll see how it plays out. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=650.08s)]
*  But honestly, I get the sense that Andrew Tate overall has fallen out of favor with most [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=658.0s)]
*  conservatives anyway. So maybe it would have been better to just ignore him entirely. And really, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=663.12s)]
*  the worst guy in all of this, in my opinion, is the guy who has two daughters but has provided [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=670.24s)]
*  Andrew Tate a platform where he gets complimented by a Trump lawyer who's apparently a big fan. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=675.76s)]
*  So terrible. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npqgjxbr0s&t=682.88s)]
