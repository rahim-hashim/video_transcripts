"Vice President JD Vance claimed Sunday on social media that federal judges were not allowed to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù the ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù power of the executive branch after Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE was blocked from accessing Treasury Department payment systems.

The claim shocked many and led to a call by Musk to ‚Äúimpeach‚Äù the judge. The head of President Donald Trump‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) also for reforms that would see some judges removed for intervening with White House directives."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# JD Vance: F*** SEPARATION OF POWERS
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE)
*  J.D. Vance said judges aren't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=0.0s)]
*  allowed to control the executive [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=1.5s)]
*  power. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=2.96s)]
*  What's your take on that? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=3.46s)]
*  Yesterday, President Donald Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=5.46s)]
*  was asked about a shocking post [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  that was authored by his own [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=10.18s)]
*  vice president, J.D. Vance. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=12.06s)]
*  Now we'll show you what Trump had [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=14.52s)]
*  to say in just a minute. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=15.9s)]
*  You definitely want to hear it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=17.12s)]
*  But first, we do need to explain [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=18.26s)]
*  what J.D. Vance wrote and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=20.18s)]
*  why he wrote it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  So on Saturday, a federal judge [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=22.84s)]
*  issued an injunction that blocked [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=25.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and his Doge team from [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=27.34s)]
*  accessing the Treasury Department's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=29.56s)]
*  central payment system. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=32.04s)]
*  Now the payment system contains all [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=34.48s)]
*  sorts of private information about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=36.36s)]
*  all of us, okay? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=38.2s)]
*  Our social security information, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=39.0s)]
*  sensitive stuff like that, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=41.08s)]
*  bank account numbers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=42.68s)]
*  Now the injunction came after 19 [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=44.32s)]
*  state attorneys general sued Musk [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=46.72s)]
*  and Doge claiming that Doge's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=49.22s)]
*  access to the system could [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=51.42s)]
*  illegally interfere with funds [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=53.36s)]
*  appropriated by Congress, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=55.56s)]
*  could break federal administrative [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=57.6s)]
*  law, and violated the Treasury [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=60.32s)]
*  Department's legal obligation to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=62.6s)]
*  keep Americans' personal private [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  information and data safe. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=67.88s)]
*  Now a hearing on the issue has been [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=70.44s)]
*  set for February 14th, but [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=72.72s)]
*  the Trump administration has not [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=74.62s)]
*  been reacting well to this, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=76.84s)]
*  The temporary block of Elon Musk [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=79.36s)]
*  being able to access all that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=81.26s)]
*  private data, he doesn't like it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=82.76s)]
*  He's been complaining about it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=84.68s)]
*  Multiple posts on X make that clear. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=86.4s)]
*  He writes this ruling is absolutely [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=89.08s)]
*  insane. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=90.92s)]
*  How on earth are we supposed to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=91.64s)]
*  stop fraud and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=93.06s)]
*  waste of taxpayer money without [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=93.68s)]
*  looking at how money is spent? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=95.28s)]
*  That's literally impossible. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=97.2s)]
*  Something super shady is going to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=99.12s)]
*  protect scammers. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=101.36s)]
*  He later wrote that a corrupt judge [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=103.64s)]
*  is protecting corruption. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=105.44s)]
*  He needs to be impeached now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=106.76s)]
*  But Jayne Evans took it a step [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=109.4s)]
*  further and this is genuinely [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  concerning because if he's going [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=112.8s)]
*  along with what Curtis Yarvin who [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  wants literal monarchy in America, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=117.28s)]
*  if he goes along with what [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=119.84s)]
*  Yarvin wants, we have [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=121.6s)]
*  a constitutional crisis on our [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  hands, so let me explain. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=125.04s)]
*  Jaydee Vance wrote, if a judge [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=128.12s)]
*  tried to tell a general how to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=129.72s)]
*  conduct a military operation, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=131.24s)]
*  that would be illegal. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=133.08s)]
*  If a judge tried to command [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=135.52s)]
*  the attorney general in how to use [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=137.16s)]
*  her discretion as a prosecutor, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=139.36s)]
*  that's also illegal. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=141.52s)]
*  Judges aren't allowed to control [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=143.64s)]
*  the executive's legitimate power, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=145.6s)]
*  although judges are supposed to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=147.92s)]
*  check, be part of our system of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  checks and balances, and check [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=152.16s)]
*  a president if he does something [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  that goes beyond his constitutional [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=156.64s)]
*  duties, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=159.27999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, yeah, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=160.72s)]
*  if a general commits war crimes, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=163.26s)]
*  a judge can weigh in. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=166.0s)]
*  You literally do have a situation [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=167.88s)]
*  where the courts can weigh in. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=172.92s)]
*  That statement by Jaydee Vance is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=174.42s)]
*  100% wrong. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=176.16s)]
*  It's meant to, and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=177.64s)]
*  Jaydee Vance went to Yale, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=179.04s)]
*  he knows it's wrong. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=180.88s)]
*  He's meant to trick you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=182.4s)]
*  So if a judge tried to command [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  the attorney general on how to use [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=185.24s)]
*  her discretion as a prosecutor, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=186.64s)]
*  that's also legal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=188.04s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  It depends on the situation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=189.84s)]
*  What if the prosecutor took [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=190.88s)]
*  a bribe, and so decided not to do [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=192.28s)]
*  a prosecution of a murderer? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=194.12s)]
*  The judge can step in and go, no, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=196.48s)]
*  you took a bribe, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  you're not allowed to do that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=198.68s)]
*  So does this mean that any judges [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=199.68s)]
*  were unable to or prevented from [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=202.44s)]
*  ever weighing in on the special [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=205.0s)]
*  counsel's prosecution of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=209.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's another great [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=211.28s)]
*  question. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=213.56s)]
*  So look, guys, Marbury v Madison, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  the most important case in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=217.36s)]
*  Supreme Court history, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  one of the first cases that set [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  most important precedent, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=223.08s)]
*  which is the courts decide what is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=225.08s)]
*  constitutional and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=227.24s)]
*  not constitutional. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=228.48s)]
*  You need that ref because you're [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=229.84s)]
*  always going to have questions [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=231.56s)]
*  about what is constitutional and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  not. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  If the executive branch goes, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  I'm deciding what's constitutional, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=236.72s)]
*  well, that's a giant problem, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=238.6s)]
*  because then that leads [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=240.12s)]
*  to authoritarianism. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=241.04s)]
*  That is why we objected to Barack [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=242.0s)]
*  Obama doing unilateral drone [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  strikes on American citizens [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  without judicial approval. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=251.6s)]
*  Eric Holder should hold his head in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=252.76s)]
*  shame for the rest of his life for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=255.32s)]
*  saying that due process is not [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=257.96s)]
*  necessarily judicial review, okay? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=260.28s)]
*  That the executive branch can do [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=263.28s)]
*  due process on their own. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=265.28s)]
*  That is garbage. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=266.88s)]
*  It's not even close to true. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=268.23999999999995s)]
*  Eric Holder also went to the top [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=269.79999999999995s)]
*  schools and he knows that's not [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=271.4s)]
*  true. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=273.12s)]
*  So we are fair and honest no matter [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=273.79999999999995s)]
*  who's president or which side. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=275.67999999999995s)]
*  What Barack Obama did was totally [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=277.76s)]
*  unacceptable. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=279.52s)]
*  And what they're saying here is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=280.52s)]
*  beyond unacceptable. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=282.52s)]
*  Because if you don't listen to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  the executive branch, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  then our entire system breaks down. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=287.68s)]
*  Because then the executive branch [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  doesn't have to listen to anyone. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=291.24s)]
*  Because if the courts say, hey, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=292.6s)]
*  wait, Congress approved that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=293.92s)]
*  spending and the executive branch [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=295.2s)]
*  says, I'm not going to do [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=296.68s)]
*  the spending. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=297.68s)]
*  But wait, the Congress is supposed [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=298.68s)]
*  to pass the laws. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=300.44s)]
*  They have the power of the purse. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=301.6s)]
*  But if the executive branch doesn't [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  listen to the courts, then they [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=304.88s)]
*  don't have to listen to Congress [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=306.36s)]
*  either. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  That means that we don't have [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=308.76s)]
*  a democracy anymore and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  the president is king. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=311.48s)]
*  We have a dictatorship. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=312.76s)]
*  Yes, and so this is thermonuclear [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=314.20000000000005s)]
*  bad. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=318.12s)]
*  Because if the courts say, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=319.24s)]
*  Mr. President, you cannot do this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=322.0s)]
*  It is unconstitutional or illegal. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  And he says, I don't care. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=329.24s)]
*  I'm going to do it anyway, and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  I have the guns and you don't. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, that means we, I mean, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=334.6s)]
*  we'll try to have elections next [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=336.56s)]
*  time around. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=338.76000000000005s)]
*  That means we've got a giant hole [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  in our democracy. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=342.12s)]
*  And that ship is going to sink real [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=343.48s)]
*  quick, because if that means there's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  really no check on the presidency. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=347.8s)]
*  That's not America. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=350.6s)]
*  That's not democracy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=351.72s)]
*  That's not our constitution. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=353.16s)]
*  So of all the stories we've covered [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=354.72s)]
*  for you, I think this is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=356.6s)]
*  the most dangerous. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=359.24s)]
*  And I think that they are going to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  ignore the courts. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=362.6s)]
*  And if they do ignore the courts, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  then what happens? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=366.04s)]
*  I mean, does the Supreme Court call [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=367.88s)]
*  for their arrest? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=369.76s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  No, so one of the next steps is, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=372.64s)]
*  and this is unfortunately both [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=375.44s)]
*  tragic and amusing because of how [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=378.32s)]
*  ridiculous it is. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=381.47999999999996s)]
*  They say the next thing that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  the courts would do if you're not [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=385.4s)]
*  following orders, and in one of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=386.88s)]
*  the cases, the Trump administration [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=388.44s)]
*  so far has not followed the orders. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  And a judge has said, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=393.4s)]
*  you're not following a court order. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=394.64s)]
*  You must do that right now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=396.64s)]
*  The next thing they would have is [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  contempt. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=400.0s)]
*  You're in contempt, okay? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  All right, and what does that do? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  What sanctions does that carry? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=403.8s)]
*  Nothing, zero. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  And so the article is hilariously [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=406.32s)]
*  explained, but [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=408.24s)]
*  that has the power of shaming. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=409.24s)]
*  Come on. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=410.91999999999996s)]
*  How are you going to shame people [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=413.64s)]
*  that are shameless? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=414.59999999999997s)]
*  So it's, and look guys, you don't [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=415.8s)]
*  go and do this unless you were [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=418.24s)]
*  planning to ignore the courts. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=420.24s)]
*  Hence, the shaming is not going to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=422.56s)]
*  work at all. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=424.44s)]
*  The idea that Donald Trump would be [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=425.68s)]
*  shamed into action is absurd. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=428.08s)]
*  And so that means, okay, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=431.32000000000005s)]
*  well then what's next? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=433.0s)]
*  There really isn't anything next. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=435.56s)]
*  The executive branch has the guns. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=437.32000000000005s)]
*  And if you're a patriot who [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  worried about government tyranny, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=441.88s)]
*  it's knocking at your door. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=445.32000000000005s)]
*  If there are no checks and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  balances and the courts cannot say [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=450.72s)]
*  what is legal and illegal, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=452.44s)]
*  that means the executive branch can [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=453.8s)]
*  do any tyranny they like. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=455.72s)]
*  And then later when you object and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=456.8s)]
*  you say, well, no, no, no, no, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  I just wanted you to take away [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  some agencies. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  I didn't want you to do tyranny [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  against me. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  Too late, you already [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=465.92s)]
*  cosigned on it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=467.04s)]
*  So look guys, I literally, this is [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=468.44s)]
*  one of those stories, I literally [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  don't know what's going to happen, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=472.72s)]
*  but that would be a bona fide, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=475.04s)]
*  horrific constitutional crisis if [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=477.32s)]
*  Trump does not listen to the courts. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  There is no good answer for [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=484.6s)]
*  how that ends. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Tolx2SIQE&t=485.96000000000004s)]
