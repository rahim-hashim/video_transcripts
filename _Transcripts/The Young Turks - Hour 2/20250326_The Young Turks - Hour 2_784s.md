# Bernie Walks Off Interview After "Nonsense, Inside The Beltway" Question
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o)
*  You're out there with AOC today. Would you like to see her join in the Senate? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=0.0s)]
*  I, right now we have, as I said, just a whole lot of people in the carcass. Okay, Jonathan, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=3.36s)]
*  thanks. Wait, I got one more. I got one more. This is important. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=8.96s)]
*  Well, I asked you. Okay. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=10.96s)]
*  You know, you want to do nonsense, do nonsense. No. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=12.24s)]
*  I don't want to talk about inside the beltway stuff. I got 32,000 people. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=15.6s)]
*  I was just asking about AOC because she was out there with you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=18.56s)]
*  Fine, but I don't want to talk about this. What was the last question? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=20.64s)]
*  I was just going to ask you one more question about you. I mean, that's all. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=23.36s)]
*  I was literally the last. What is your question? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=25.68s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders did not take kindly to the line of questioning from ABC's Jonathan [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=30.08s)]
*  Carl and he cut an interview short when Carl asked Sanders whether or not [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=36.56s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should primary Chuck Schumer in the Senate. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=42.88s)]
*  Now, of course, what spurred that question is the fact that a lot of Democratic voters have [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=47.6s)]
*  soured on Senator Schumer after he decided to aid in a bet the Republican Party in passing the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  government spending bill in which the president will now have unilateral power to move money [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=58.8s)]
*  around as he pleases. So look, I've got more details, including some statements from [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=64.8s)]
*  Congressman Ro Khanna on some of this. Before we get to it, how do you feel about the way [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=71.2s)]
*  Senator Sanders handled that, Cenk? So I love that Bernie's doing a tour. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  I talked about it earlier in the week and AOC is doing a great job on that tour. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=80.24s)]
*  Ro Khanna has been terrific on all the shows, etc. And he's also on a tour, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=83.84s)]
*  Benefits Over Billionaires. So these are people doing the right thing and getting out the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=89.2s)]
*  popular message, the economic populist message that we have. But what you saw in that interview [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=94.0s)]
*  there is Bernie's Achilles heel. Yeah, I agree. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=100.48s)]
*  Criticizing other Democrats is his kryptonite. He can't do it. But brother, at some point, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=103.44s)]
*  you're gonna have to criticize fellow Democrats, cuz they're the ones standing in your way. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=111.52s)]
*  You can't even get to the Republicans without going through Schumer. And so when the Democrats [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=116.16s)]
*  were in charge, they said, no, no, no, Bernie, you can't get $15 minimum wage. You can't get paid [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  family leave. You can't get any of these things because filibuster, because parliamentarian, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  because gobbledygook. Okay, but I can't get to arguing with Mitch McConnell until I get past [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=133.04s)]
*  Schumer and Manchin and Sinema, etc. You have to criticize them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=139.6s)]
*  You have to take them on. You have to challenge them. You have to defeat them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=143.68s)]
*  I know they're theoretic. They're not even in your party. You're an independent, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  But whenever anything's mentioned like that, he's like, he just runs screaming from the building. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=151.12s)]
*  And so should he have attacked Hillary Clinton on her corruption? Yes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=157.12s)]
*  And he did, he did. No, this much, this much. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=162.4s)]
*  I remember 2016. He did hit her on her corruption. No, no. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  A lot. He refused to attack her on the emails. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  No, no, no, I don't want him attacking on the emails. Our core issues. No, Anna, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  so look, I know the inside details of this. So first of all, you're right, he pointed out [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  that she would do speeches at the banks and stuff. And I was thrilled about that. But when asked at [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  a critical debate, and I wrote about this in my book, Justice is Coming, and his team prepared [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=186.48s)]
*  an answer for, hey, is Hillary Clinton changing her votes based on money she's taking from the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  banks? You criticized her for taking money from the banks. He was supposed to say yes, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=202.56s)]
*  because it is true. She changed her stance on the bankruptcy bill. It's clear as day. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  And he just couldn't get himself to do it. And he said no. But then if she's not changing her votes, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=213.27999999999997s)]
*  then what are you running against her for, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  Okay, so look, I'm somewhere between you and Bernie. I agree that Bernie's unwillingness to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  ever, ever point out some of the flaws in his own party is an Achilles heel he has. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  But also Cenk, you understand, right, that your temperament, your demeanor, the way that you want [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=235.2s)]
*  to fight, fight, fight all the time is also gonna be ineffective. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=241.28s)]
*  No, I don't agree with that at all. No, I'm being dead serious. And I've already been proven right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  So let me just explain real quick, cuz I know it's a natural reaction to say, no, no, no, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=249.6s)]
*  that can't work, or that's just too harsh, or it's too extreme, etc. And there is a part of it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=254.64s)]
*  that's correct, not that it can't win. The part you're right about, Ana, and what I've realized [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=260.08s)]
*  through all these long years of asking them to fight their colleagues, cuz they're standing in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=264.08s)]
*  your way, right, and they're the ones who are also corrupt. They're also taking donor money, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=268.8s)]
*  etc. Is that, no, they don't have my temperament and they just can't do it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=272.8s)]
*  I'm not blaming Bernie because he's a bad guy, not at all. He's a great guy. In fact, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=277.44s)]
*  he's too nice, right? Again, in the Biden debates, they had it prepared to criticize them on things [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=281.92s)]
*  he should have criticized them on. And he said he'd do it and he got up to the lectern and he just [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=289.12s)]
*  couldn't do it. He couldn't pull the trigger, right? So why do I say my way could work? Because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=293.6s)]
*  we've already seen it work. I get that it's apples and oranges when you're talking about, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=297.92s)]
*  to some degree, when you're talking about Republican voters and Democratic voters. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=301.68s)]
*  But Trump just did it. He bullied the living crap out of his party. He was as combative as humanly [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=305.68s)]
*  possible. And remember, guys, now everybody knows it. But back in 2015, when he started to do that, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=311.68s)]
*  every single person said, you can't win with that temperament. You can't attack your own party. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  That's a terrible strategy. You'll never win that way. And you'll destroy your party. You'll take [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  away power from your party. It'll create division within your party. And is that what happened? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=326.88s)]
*  No, he beat everybody in his own party. Then he won the general election. And now he did a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=332.24s)]
*  miraculous comeback and won again. Combative works in politics. It definitely, indisputably, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=337.52s)]
*  works in politics. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=344.32s)]
*  Listen, I get it. There are other factors or other things that played to Donald Trump's benefit, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=345.04s)]
*  including the fact that he was a celebrity for decades. People would watch him on The Apprentice. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=353.36s)]
*  People idolized him. So he kind of came in with a fan base baked in. And so he had the, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=359.36s)]
*  I know it's hard for people to believe it, but he has the cool factor. And he's going to war [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  against establishment fuddy duddy Republicans. Of course, it's gonna work. I don't know if it [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  would work in the case. Look, I think Bernie Sanders should fight. I just think [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=377.92s)]
*  you have one speed and your one speed is fight. Okay, and I think- [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=384.24s)]
*  And it's the correct speed. And I'm not saying that because it's my temperament. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm saying that because strategically you can't. So when Trump said on the stage, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=391.68s)]
*  all these guys are corrupt. I gave them money and they did whatever I wanted. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=396.88s)]
*  That's when I said he's gonna win. And do you know, and people forget this. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=401.12s)]
*  When Trump started running in 2015, do you know what he started at? Mr. Famous Celebrity [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=404.56s)]
*  on The Apprentice, 1% in the polls. He actually, now look, Ana's right that his celebrity gave him [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=408.56s)]
*  so much cache that it allowed him to go into media endlessly. And so like, for example, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=416.72s)]
*  someone like me were to run, you wouldn't get that advantage. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=422.4s)]
*  I mean, you did run. You didn't get any advantage. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=425.76s)]
*  Right, I didn't get any mainstream media, right? So and that's what they do to progressives. And [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=427.52s)]
*  that's what they did to Bernie in 2015. Again, I wrote about this in Justice is Coming. ABC News [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=431.44s)]
*  in primetime covered him for seven seconds as he was doing his own rise from 1% to 48% [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=436.56s)]
*  in that primary. ABC is like, I don't see it. I don't see it. And most of the mainstream media [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=443.76s)]
*  is like, I don't see it. So yes, Trump had that huge advantage that Bernie didn't have. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=447.28s)]
*  But he still started at 1%. And what made him go up to 55, 60% was the fight, was the fact that he [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=451.52s)]
*  was willing to fight. And the fight brings more media attention too. But you've got to fight on [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=460.0s)]
*  your moral high ground. He did it from a Republican perspective. We could do it from a populist left [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=463.92s)]
*  perspective. But when they ask you about Democrats, you can't run from the building. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=468.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=472.4s)]
*  Otherwise you won't win. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=472.8s)]
*  I think that Bernie felt burned from the way that he carried himself when he was a member of the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=473.84s)]
*  House. Because that's when he was a fire breathing congressman and would call out members of his own [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=481.28s)]
*  party regularly. I mean, there's video of this. You can check it out on C-SPAN. We've played [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=488.0s)]
*  some of it on the show in the past. And he wasn't successful. So I think that he's under the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=492.32s)]
*  impression that fighting against members of your, I mean, I can't even say it's members of his own [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=498.08s)]
*  party because he is in fact an independent. But essentially, fighting against the party [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=502.48s)]
*  that you're closer to might not necessarily help you win. But again, I disagree with that thought. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=506.72s)]
*  I think that there were areas in which he could have fought and he could have won. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=514.0s)]
*  And I don't know why he feels the need to provide cover for the likes of like Chuck Schumer, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=518.88s)]
*  of all people. It's just, or Joe Biden. I mean, I gave him a pass with Joe Biden because it was [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=524.16s)]
*  clear to me that he had some sway over Joe Biden's decisions. Not enough if you ask me, but some. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=529.04s)]
*  And maybe he didn't wanna ruin that relationship because you know how [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=536.4s)]
*  Washington works, especially with Democrats. You tweak them a little bit. You criticize them, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=539.6s)]
*  critique them a little bit. Regardless of how soft your tone is, regardless of the kid gloves [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=546.16s)]
*  you're wearing as you're doing it. My God, they get offended so easily and that's it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=551.12s)]
*  They totally blacklist you. They won't work with you. They won't listen to you. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=556.32s)]
*  This is why Democrats suck. And I'm not talking about the voters. I'm talking about the politicians. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=561.76s)]
*  Okay, they will not take any constructive feedback. They don't learn. They don't grow. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=566.24s)]
*  They don't adapt. That's why the party is in shambles right now. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=570.56s)]
*  Yeah, but today's a new day. And so I think that I'm hoping that Bernie, AOC and the others adjust, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  right? Because I get what Ana is saying. She's totally right. And I get that Bernie, AOC and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  others were in a super difficult position. Because if you're not in Washington, you can't understand [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=588.0s)]
*  how toxic that culture is. And when they're in that bubble, they don't realize it's toxic. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=592.32s)]
*  They get brainwashed into believing that it's normal and real. So when AOC first went in and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=598.24s)]
*  she did the sit in Nancy Pelosi's office, everybody was like, how dare you? You're so mean. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=603.2s)]
*  You're so unkind. You're gonna destroy the Democratic Party. This is so terrible. You're [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=608.88s)]
*  such a bad person. And a good person goes, my God, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  okay, okay, okay. And then what happened was she became friends with her colleagues and stuff and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=618.32s)]
*  she learned to get along. But the problem is that doesn't actually fix anything. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=624.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=630.96s)]
*  And so look, and I understand that Bernie and the others had the idea that, hey, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=631.36s)]
*  at least Biden's listening to us. For the first time in our careers, we've got someone in power [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=637.36s)]
*  listening to us. I have empathy for that. But my sense was that insider strategy wasn't gonna work [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=641.44s)]
*  cuz those guys aren't really your friends and they're not really your colleagues. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  It's good cop, bad cop. They're the good cops pretending to be on your side. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=652.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, they're not even gonna do the bare minimum. And then what happened? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=656.24s)]
*  They didn't even do $15 minimum wage. They didn't even do paid family leave. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=661.2s)]
*  They didn't do all of these bills that not only were supposed to be the core of the Democratic [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=665.12s)]
*  agenda, not only the easiest ones to pass, but the ones that were so popular. Not only would it [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=669.7600000000001s)]
*  have been a layup, it would have made them more popular and maybe win the election. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=675.84s)]
*  But they refuse to do that. And so this is the core of what, and look, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=679.6s)]
*  it's okay if he finds me obnoxious. I don't mind, okay? But honestly, what Bernie and AOC [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=684.72s)]
*  cannot get into their heads is money and politics. They talk about it. They believe that it's a [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=690.0s)]
*  huge problem, but they can't get into their heads. Your colleagues take the same money. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  It corrupts them. Your colleagues are never going to agree with you on any of these issues. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=701.92s)]
*  You think they agree with you. They do not. They will vote against you. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=708.8s)]
*  And they did, even when you had all of the power, you had the House, the Senate, the White House, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=713.4399999999999s)]
*  and they wouldn't even give you $15 minimum wage. That was the very first thing that Biden took out [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=718.88s)]
*  of the bill. So please, I know you're good people, but you gotta wake up to the fact [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=723.28s)]
*  that your colleagues are not, so-called colleagues are not on your side. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=729.04s)]
*  They play, that insider strategy is never, ever, ever going to work. In good news, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=732.8s)]
*  you're outsiders. Go from the outside. This is the perfect time because democratic leadership [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  is totally discredited. And they're down to a 27% favorability for the Democratic Party. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=743.04s)]
*  All of the Democratic voters are looking for new leadership. And the tour is working, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=749.28s)]
*  all these tours, that's perfect, that's beautiful. Keep going. But if you're doing that and at the end, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=754.0799999999999s)]
*  you go back to an insider strategy, then it's all gonna be for nothing. You gotta go outside [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=758.72s)]
*  of strategy, economic populism, gather up the Democratic voters, and whoever's gonna be the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=763.52s)]
*  new leader, let's go. This is the time to take over the Democratic Party. This is not the time [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=769.36s)]
*  to be nice. This is the time to be strong for the voters. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMHpixql5o&t=773.6800000000001s)]
