TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Trump's Commerce Sec Goes on Fox News To Publicly Lick Elon Musk's Boots
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo)
*  I think if you want to learn [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=0.0s)]
*  something on this show tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=1.6s)]
*  You're watching Commerce Secretary [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=3.24s)]
*  Howard Lutnick on last night's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=5.62s)]
*  edition of Jesse Water Show. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=7.54s)]
*  And he's about to teach the audience [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=9.68s)]
*  how to do favors for [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=12.0s)]
*  unelected oligarchs. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=13.24s)]
*  Let's take a look at what he has to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=14.84s)]
*  say and what you should invest. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=16.72s)]
*  By Tesla, it's unbelievable that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=18.72s)]
*  this guy's stock is this cheap. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=21.0s)]
*  It'll never be this cheap again. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=23.56s)]
*  Now, that was actually far from [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=27.68s)]
*  the end of Lutnick's praise for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=29.64s)]
*  Musk. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=31.68s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=32.2s)]
*  I personally don't care if he [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=33.620000000000005s)]
*  wants to praise Elon Musk. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=35.32s)]
*  Of course, Howard Lutnick is going [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=36.96s)]
*  to do that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=38.52s)]
*  He's part of the Trump [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  administration. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=40.18s)]
*  However, it is kind of interesting [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=40.96s)]
*  to see government officials go on [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=43.84s)]
*  cable news and essentially do sales [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=46.52s)]
*  pitches for the companies and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=49.44s)]
*  the products that are being sold [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=51.92s)]
*  by an unelected individual who's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=54.44s)]
*  very much involved in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=57.08s)]
*  the administration. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=58.68s)]
*  And the only reason why he is is [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=60.28s)]
*  because he spent hundreds of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=61.86s)]
*  millions of dollars to get Trump [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=63.24s)]
*  elected. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=64.68s)]
*  It's just kind of a sick system. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=65.18s)]
*  But nonetheless, here's Lutnick [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=66.56s)]
*  going on and on about how the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=68.48s)]
*  unofficial head of Doge is just so [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=70.1s)]
*  awesome. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=72.1s)]
*  When people understand the things [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=74.28s)]
*  he's building, the robots he's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=76.0s)]
*  building, the technology he's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=77.68s)]
*  building, people are going to be [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=79.4s)]
*  dreaming of today and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=81.2s)]
*  Jesse Water's and thinking, gosh, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=82.38s)]
*  I should have bought Elon Musk's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  stock. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=86.34s)]
*  I mean, who wouldn't invest in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=86.92s)]
*  Elon Musk? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=88.66s)]
*  You gotta be kidding me. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=89.28s)]
*  All right, so you're calling [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=90.52s)]
*  the bottom. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=91.76s)]
*  This is it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=92.48s)]
*  Whether today's the bottom or not, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  I tell you what, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=95.54s)]
*  Elon Musk is probably the best [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=96.64s)]
*  person to bet on I've ever met. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=98.56s)]
*  And I think we all know that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=100.56s)]
*  I mean, gosh, in the same week that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=102.36s)]
*  he saves astronauts with his [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=104.6s)]
*  rockets that he invented. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=106.6s)]
*  Imagine that, he's building the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=108.44s)]
*  coolest robots you've ever seen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=110.56s)]
*  Go online and look up Optimus. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=112.8s)]
*  It is the coolest thing you've ever [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=115.64s)]
*  seen. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  We're all going to be buying [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  robots that are going to cost about [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  $30,000. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  You're going to be buying a Tesla [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  robot and anybody doesn't buy a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  Tesla robot is going to be silly. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  No one's going to be key in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=126.28s)]
*  anything. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk is the best entrepreneur [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=128.16s)]
*  and technologist in America. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=131.72s)]
*  And I bet on him. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=132.22s)]
*  I wish I was allowed. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=133.12s)]
*  Secretary. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=134.16s)]
*  I'm not allowed to buy any stock. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=134.66s)]
*  I got to- [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=135.64s)]
*  So according to Tesla's website, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=138.88s)]
*  Optimus is a general purpose, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=141.12s)]
*  a pedal, autonomous humanoid robot [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=143.48s)]
*  capable of performing unsafe, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=146.2s)]
*  repetitive and boring tasks. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=148.48s)]
*  Wow, that really does. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=150.4s)]
*  That excites me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=151.32s)]
*  I really get excited at the notion [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=152.96s)]
*  of human workers getting replaced [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=154.92s)]
*  by robots. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=156.84s)]
*  Anyway, here's some footage of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=157.48s)]
*  Optimus in action. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  So anyway, was you're laughing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=173.44s)]
*  Look, if you've been paying [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  attention to Elon and what he does [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=203.86s)]
*  and these companies, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=206.44s)]
*  he didn't found Tesla. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  Tesla was already a car company [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=210.72s)]
*  that existed. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=212.44s)]
*  He bought it, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=213.24s)]
*  sort of did a hostile takeover. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  And to his credit, he made Tesla [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=216.0s)]
*  into a company that can make cars [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  reasonably cheap and sold a nice [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=219.8s)]
*  amount of these cars. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=221.88000000000002s)]
*  That's a legitimate [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=223.4s)]
*  accomplishment. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=224.72000000000003s)]
*  He took out the quote unquote fat [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=225.72000000000003s)]
*  in terms of the operations process [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=227.8s)]
*  and made it into a profitable [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=230.44s)]
*  company. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=232.04s)]
*  But I promise you guys, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=232.76s)]
*  the Tesla stock price is not based [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=234.56s)]
*  on having four models of a car and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=237.12s)]
*  selling them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=239.8s)]
*  That stock price is based on [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=241.4s)]
*  Elon's ability to convince [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=243.2s)]
*  the market, to convince really [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=244.88s)]
*  rich dudes that he's got his eye on [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=247.04s)]
*  the future. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=249.32s)]
*  That is going to be these autonomous [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=250.0s)]
*  cars that we're going to make [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=251.48s)]
*  them really cheap. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=252.76s)]

*  where American workers have been [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=437.28s)]

*  But the thing that I wouldn't say [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=444.84s)]
*  respected about Republicans, but [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=446.76s)]
*  the thing that made me less angry [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=449.0s)]
*  at Republicans compared to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=451.12s)]
*  Democrats when they shaft workers, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=452.96s)]
*  is that they tell you they're [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=455.4s)]
*  going to shaft the workers. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  They tell you they're going to do [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=458.96s)]
*  it, whereas Democrats do [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=460.23999999999995s)]
*  the opposite. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=461.28s)]

*  for the working class and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=463.52s)]
*  then they turn around and shaft them. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=464.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay, that's what Democrats [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=466.44s)]
*  typically do, and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=468.0s)]
*  that infuriates me. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=468.96s)]
*  So it would have been far better if [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=470.68s)]
*  Trump just said exactly who he is [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=472.4s)]
*  and what he intends on doing, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=474.08s)]
*  because it's insulting to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=475.67999999999995s)]
*  the American people to pretend you [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=477.2s)]

*  far in his second term. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=485.32s)]
*  And I don't really see it getting [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=486.67999999999995s)]

*  The Commerce Secretary yesterday [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  said that Tesla stock is something [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=532.88s)]
*  that Americans should be buying. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  Is that the stance of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=537.32s)]
*  the administration that people [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=538.48s)]

*  Is that something that the Commerce [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=541.72s)]
*  Secretary should be recommending? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=543.1600000000001s)]
*  I think the Commerce Secretary was [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=544.2800000000001s)]
*  reiterating that the President's [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=546.12s)]
*  support is an American made company [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=548.0s)]
*  like Tesla, who produces a very [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=549.92s)]
*  good product for the American [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=551.64s)]
*  people, which was beloved by [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=553.16s)]
*  the American people, particularly [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=554.66s)]
*  Democrats, until Elon Musk decided [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=556.52s)]
*  to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=558.32s)]
*  And now we've seen despicable and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=559.84s)]
*  unacceptable violence taking place [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=561.68s)]
*  across our country at Tesla [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=563.64s)]
*  dealerships against workers, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=565.08s)]
*  employees, and also innocent [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=566.84s)]
*  Americans who drive these vehicles. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=568.4s)]
*  Okay, so that wasn't so [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=572.72s)]
*  much a backpedal, it was more of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=573.88s)]
*  a deflection. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=575.68s)]
*  Because look, I agree with much of [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=577.44s)]
*  what she had to say there actually, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=579.4000000000001s)]
*  okay? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  It sucks though, that Elon Musk is [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=582.08s)]
*  the guy behind the car company that [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=584.8000000000001s)]

*  America. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=590.0400000000001s)]

*  the market right now. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=594.08s)]
*  And I love that, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=596.36s)]
*  I want to celebrate that, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=597.36s)]
*  that is a good thing, okay? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=599.08s)]
*  But at the same time, while I [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=601.64s)]
*  condemn the people who are doing [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  dangerous, violent, loathsome [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=605.9599999999999s)]

*  shooting guns into the dealerships, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=612.3399999999999s)]

*  bad thing. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=622.16s)]
*  We're asking whether it makes sense [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=622.8s)]
*  to have a cabinet official from [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=624.8s)]

*  television and urge the American [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=628.28s)]
*  people to buy Tesla stock. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=630.0s)]
*  What does she have to say about [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=632.16s)]
*  that? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, she's going to deflect. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=634.0s)]
*  I mean, I gotta say she's 27 years [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=635.28s)]
*  old and she's got the whole press [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=637.56s)]
*  secretary role on lock. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=639.72s)]
*  She must have been studying this [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=641.72s)]
*  in the womb because she knows [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=643.52s)]
*  exactly how to do it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=645.16s)]
*  But look, this country is, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=646.52s)]
*  I'm starting to feel that you're [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  either a grifter who's looking to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=652.36s)]

*  There's no middle ground at this [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=661.12s)]
*  point and it pisses me off. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=662.68s)]
*  Because the vast majority of [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=664.52s)]
*  Americans are not looking to be [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=665.76s)]
*  grifters. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=666.92s)]
*  They're not looking to be thieves. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=667.36s)]
*  They're not looking to victimize [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=668.68s)]
*  other people. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=669.92s)]
*  They want to work hard. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=670.68s)]

*  They want to thrive and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=672.4399999999999s)]
*  they deserve that. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=673.48s)]
*  But the system is set up to prey on [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=675.16s)]
*  them and all the incentives are in [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=677.56s)]
*  the wrong place. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=680.1999999999999s)]
*  They really are. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=681.68s)]

*  It's pathetic. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=690.7199999999999s)]
*  All right, and I don't like the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=691.44s)]
*  thing is was I what even is the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=693.84s)]
*  point of talking about it? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=696.12s)]

*  I mean, it's important for [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=700.5200000000001s)]
*  people to know what's going on. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=702.2800000000001s)]
*  And I think there's always a [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=704.6s)]
*  capacity for some level of radical [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=706.48s)]
*  change like radically different [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=708.8800000000001s)]

*  look feel pretty bleak and [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=715.96s)]
*  pretty dire right now. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  But change is not impossible, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=719.8s)]
*  right? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=721.6s)]
*  A lot of people will say like my [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=722.12s)]
*  man Matt Karp will say we're [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=723.92s)]
*  living in the new Gilded Age. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=725.64s)]

*  a previous Gilded Age where there [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=729.04s)]

*  the rest of the Robert Barons. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=736.6s)]
*  And they drove the unfortunately [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=738.92s)]
*  it took these guys driving [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=741.16s)]

*  Yes. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=807.76s)]
*  Yes, that's why I'm not expecting [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=808.28s)]
*  another deal. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=810.4799999999999s)]
*  Because now you have the Federal [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=811.56s)]
*  Reserve and they're like, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=813.3199999999999s)]
*  there's an economic meltdown. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=815.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's just print money. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=817.12s)]
*  Let's just ensure that we print [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=818.56s)]
*  money, hand it over to the banks, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=820.7199999999999s)]
*  okay? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  And they'll be taken care of and [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=823.5999999999999s)]
*  everything's fine. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=825.52s)]
*  F the workers, F the working class. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=826.92s)]
*  But I don't think that's the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  solution. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=830.8s)]
*  I don't think that's the solution. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=831.4399999999999s)]
*  But here's one thing that I will [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=833.88s)]
*  say, we keep going in this [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=835.8s)]
*  direction. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=837.52s)]
*  I think the very thing that [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=839.12s)]
*  Roosevelt wanted to avoid might [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=840.88s)]
*  eventually come to fruition. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=843.04s)]
*  because people can only take so [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=846.04s)]
*  much. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=847.8s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=848.76s)]
*  it's not like there were a few [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=850.0s)]
*  protests that led to the new deal, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  no. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=853.44s)]
*  Workers got organized, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  things got super violent, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=856.36s)]
*  people died. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=858.24s)]
*  So look, I want to avoid avoiding [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=860.52s)]
*  a violent takeover, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=863.24s)]
*  violent revolution. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=864.4s)]
*  But we have morons leading [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=865.48s)]
*  the country on both sides of [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=867.12s)]
*  the political aisle who are so [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=868.98s)]
*  short-sided, so selfish, so greedy. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=871.0s)]
*  They don't give a damn and most of [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=874.12s)]
*  them are like 10 years away from [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=876.36s)]
*  dying anyway. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=878.36s)]
*  So they don't care, they're just [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=880.08s)]
*  going to keep doing what they're [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=881.32s)]
*  doing. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=882.52s)]
*  We need young leadership. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=883.02s)]
*  We need people who are in it for [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=884.24s)]
*  the right reasons. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=885.4s)]
*  Right now we don't have many people [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=886.4s)]
*  like that in Congress. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=887.64s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  an angel gets his swings. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=890.4000000000001s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=891.9599999999999s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=892.9599999999999s)]
*  our live shows. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7uqRvpm2jo&t=894.16s)]
