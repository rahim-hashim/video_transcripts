"Fox News host Jesse Watters argued that ‚Äúeveryone knows‚Äù in El Salvador knows that Chicago Bulls merchandise is an MS-13 gang signifier as he mocked the idea that deported Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia was really a fan of the team.

Garcia, born in El Salvador, fled to the U.S. after his family became a target of gang extortion. According to his legal filings, a local gang had begun threatening his grandmother‚Äôs small tortilla shop, demanding money and issuing death threats. Fearing for his life, Garcia crossed the border as a teen and eventually settled in Maryland, with a wife and children, where he has lived for years while seeking asylum."

# Jesse Watters' IDIOTIC Argument Against Kilmar Abrego Garcia
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE)
*  A local gang in El Salvador was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=0.0s)]
*  shaking down his grandma's tortilla [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=2.22s)]
*  shop. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=4.78s)]
*  It's a tortilla blood vendetta, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=5.44s)]
*  seriously. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=7.54s)]
*  I love that Jesse Waters is having [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=9.02s)]
*  fun as everyone here, especially [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=10.92s)]
*  the family of Kilmar and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=12.88s)]
*  Breger Garcia, waits to find out if [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=14.16s)]
*  he's still alive. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=16.04s)]
*  We were told that he was, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=17.48s)]
*  no evidence has been provided of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=20.7s)]
*  Nobody in the US government cares [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=21.2s)]
*  to bring back this 100% innocent [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=23.12s)]
*  man who a court had already ordered [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=24.92s)]
*  could not be deported there for [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=26.96s)]
*  Jesse Waters. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=28.9s)]
*  It's a joke, it's fun. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=29.979999999999997s)]
*  It's a tortilla blood bath. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=31.979999999999997s)]
*  But no, that's really, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=33.98s)]
*  it was bad what was happening [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=35.3s)]
*  there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=36.78s)]
*  Having gang violence targeting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=37.3s)]
*  perfectly innocent people just [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=39.14s)]
*  trying to operate a business. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=40.98s)]
*  See, when it's Americans that are [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=42.94s)]
*  being victimized by a gang, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=44.94s)]
*  that's justification for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=46.56s)]
*  setting aside the Constitution, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  deporting millions of people. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=49.82s)]
*  But it's a joke when it happens in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=51.5s)]
*  El Salvador, I guess. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=53.099999999999994s)]
*  Well, it was not for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=54.06s)]
*  this family, actually. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  They did have to flee trying [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=56.5s)]
*  desperately to not die. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=58.18s)]
*  In any event, I want to go through [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=59.94s)]
*  a little bit more of what Jesse [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=61.7s)]
*  Waters is saying, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=63.22s)]
*  some of the misinformation he's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=64.14s)]
*  willingly spreading about Garcia. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=65.82s)]
*  Let's jump into this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=67.74s)]
*  According to court documents, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=69.66s)]
*  Garcia and three other men were [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=71.22s)]
*  arrested in 2019. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=72.7s)]
*  He was asked if he was a gang [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=74.3s)]
*  member, he said no. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  Garcia had been deemed a gang [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=76.78s)]
*  member by the Prince George's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=78.14s)]
*  County Police Department in part, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=79.7s)]
*  because he was at the time wearing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=81.5s)]
*  a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=83.3s)]
*  Garcia is a Bulls fan, but [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=85.82s)]
*  he's from El Salvador, and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=87.5s)]
*  he lives in Maryland, not Chicago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=89.3s)]
*  The Bulls lost 60 games in 2019, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=91.94s)]
*  so why the hat? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=94.28s)]
*  Can Garcia name anyone on the team, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=96.34s)]
*  anyone on any Bulls team besides [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=98.46s)]
*  Jordan? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=100.38s)]
*  Everyone from El Salvador knows [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=100.94s)]
*  what it means when you wear [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=102.98s)]
*  a Bulls hat. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=104.58s)]
*  It means you're MS-13. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=105.62s)]
*  When you're in Compton, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=107.98s)]
*  you don't accidentally wear red and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  say, I didn't know red was bloods. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=111.5s)]
*  I'm glad that this is so convincing [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=115.26s)]
*  to Jesse Waters that he no longer [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=117.1s)]
*  has to pretend to give a damn about [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=118.82s)]
*  innocence versus guilt, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=120.58s)]
*  the Constitution, life, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=122.1s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=123.78s)]
*  No, it's done, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=125.38s)]
*  you're from El Salvador. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=126.1s)]
*  How the hell could you possibly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=127.1s)]
*  care about the Bulls? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=128.54s)]
*  Name a player. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=129.82s)]
*  If you can't name a player, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=130.9s)]
*  you can't possibly actually care [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=132.34s)]
*  about it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=133.98s)]
*  Okay, Jesse Waters, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=134.82s)]
*  name 10 trans NCAA competitors. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=136.14s)]
*  Five, two, name two of them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=139.46s)]
*  You certainly talk about [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=143.02s)]
*  women's football, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=144.26s)]
*  but you don't talk about women's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=145.26s)]
*  football topic enough. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=146.89999999999998s)]
*  Do you actually care about female [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=148.34s)]
*  athletes or are you actually [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=150.1s)]
*  a member of MS-13? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=151.62s)]
*  So look, all of this, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  the specifics don't matter. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=154.14s)]
*  I mean, the specifics of what [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=156.06s)]
*  Jesse Waters has to say about this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  Why he's talking about it [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=159.22s)]
*  is what matters. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=161.26s)]
*  So Jesse Waters is seeing that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  America is turning against Donald [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  Trump and his administration on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=166.45999999999998s)]
*  the topic of immigration. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=168.26s)]
*  More Americans now disagree with [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  Trump and his administration on [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=171.26s)]
*  the number one topic. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=172.9s)]
*  If he loses that, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=173.82000000000002s)]
*  he basically has nothing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=174.82000000000002s)]
*  And the reason he's losing it is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=176.74s)]
*  because of all of this cruelty, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=178.66000000000003s)]
*  evil and incompetence. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=180.5s)]
*  Not just with Garcia, you have [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=182.10000000000002s)]
*  the hairdresser that was deported. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  You have all of these just good [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  people being locked up. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=186.94000000000003s)]
*  Not because they've committed any [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=188.58s)]
*  crime, they haven't. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  But because they happen to be [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  brown or they happen to have [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=192.66000000000003s)]
*  an opinion that Donald Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=194.18s)]
*  doesn't agree with. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=195.86s)]
*  All of this goes directly against [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=197.5s)]
*  so many of the values that Fox News [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=199.06s)]

*  the groundwork by the way, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=477.1s)]
*  for similar sorts of groups to be [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=478.5s)]

*  a Democrat abroad. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=481.5s)]
*  So members of violent militias, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=482.86s)]
*  get them out of here. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=484.42s)]
*  El Salvador, gone, KKK, CICOT, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=485.22s)]
*  obviously. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=487.38s)]
*  Apparently anti-Semitism, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=489.02000000000004s)]

*  that's enough. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=491.62s)]
*  The Gropers, gone, get rid of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=492.38s)]

*  They can languish in CICOT too. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=495.18s)]
*  And so for the right wingers that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=497.14s)]

*  I just want you to understand [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=499.26s)]
*  the precedent that Jesse Waters and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=500.42s)]

*  continue to just applaud [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=504.82s)]
*  the evil that we're seeing. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=506.34000000000003s)]
*  So Jesse Waters shows a picture of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=508.22s)]
*  a guy wearing a hat and says that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=510.26s)]
*  that guy is in a gang. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=512.42s)]
*  And then Jesse rattles off so [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=514.58s)]
*  much knowledge of what hat or [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=516.98s)]
*  outfit or color indicates what gang [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  you're in. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=523.34s)]
*  Seems like Jesse Waters knows an [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=525.2600000000001s)]
*  awful lot about gangs. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=526.98s)]
*  That is more evidence to deport [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=528.6600000000001s)]
*  Jesse Waters than it is this guy. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=531.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=534.2600000000001s)]
*  I think we should hashtag [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=535.94s)]
*  deport Jesse Waters. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=537.4200000000001s)]
*  I'll sign on to that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=540.1s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=542.86s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13wbrVV7SE&t=544.3800000000001s)]
