TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Zohran Mamdani's Masterclass on How To Handle A Troll
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk)
*  What do you think about me storming the mayoral forums? Are you mad? Are you mad at me? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm not mad. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=5.0s)]
*  What do you think about it? You think I'm clout chasing? You think I'm annoying? What [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=6.0s)]
*  do you think? Come on, give me a real answer. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=9.0s)]
*  The first time I was scared because I did not know who you were. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=11.0s)]
*  And now you know who I am. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=14.0s)]
*  And now I expect you at the forums. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=15.0s)]
*  Okay, good. And what are the other candidates saying? Are they hating me? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=17.0s)]
*  I think they also expect you at this point. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=20.0s)]
*  Great, so Zorhan, who the hell are you? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=23.0s)]
*  The content creator who goes by Crackhead Barney caught up with New York City mayoral [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=25.0s)]
*  candidate Zorhan Mamdani and basically hit him with her signature interview style, a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=32.0s)]
*  little bit of trolling. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=38.0s)]
*  Now his handling of this entire situation, in my opinion, is a master class in how to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=39.0s)]
*  use what could potentially be a disastrous situation to your benefit in order to message [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=45.0s)]
*  what your political values are and what you're trying to get accomplished should you become [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=53.0s)]
*  the next mayor of New York City. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=58.0s)]
*  So without further ado, let's watch more. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=60.0s)]
*  What are you going to do for black people? What are you going to do for the- [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=62.0s)]
*  What we're seeing- [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=65.0s)]
*  Black people like me, annoying in their underwear, what are you going to do? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=66.0s)]
*  Look, every single person in this city deserves to afford to call this city their home. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=70.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=73.0s)]
*  And we've seen in a crisis of inequality where one in four New Yorkers are in poverty, where [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=74.0s)]
*  500,000 children are going to bed hungry. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=78.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=80.0s)]
*  And that's a disproportionate impact on black New Yorkers. From 2010 to 2019, we saw nearly [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=81.0s)]
*  20% decline in the population of black children and teenagers. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=87.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=90.0s)]
*  And that's because of how expensive we've made this city. We are losing the fabric of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=91.0s)]
*  what we love about this city. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=94.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=95.0s)]
*  And we need to make sure that for black New Yorkers who want to raise their kids here, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=96.0s)]
*  this is the most affordable and easiest place to do so because right now, that's not the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=99.0s)]
*  case. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=103.0s)]
*  That was amazing. Whether you agree with his message or not, and I happen to agree with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=104.0s)]
*  a lot of what he said there, the way he handled it was so incredible. Now, if you go to her [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=109.0s)]
*  ex page, for instance, and you see how Richie Torres handles it, even Norman Finkelstein, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=113.64s)]
*  he was just kind of caught off guard, didn't really know how to handle it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=123.4s)]
*  But in this case, Mom Donnie was ready. It's almost as if he expected the day that she [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=126.28s)]
*  would do this and used it to his advantage. It was super smart. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=131.64s)]
*  I have a slightly different interpretation, which is that it's not that he expected and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=135.52s)]
*  was ready for it. He was just ready for it because that's what he actually believes. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  That's why that video resonates, right? Because that's the problem with politicians. They're [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=142.84s)]
*  not ready for it because they're like, I have not been programmed for this. My consultants [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=146.84s)]
*  and I have not scripted something for this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=151.1s)]
*  We will get back to you later, but we hear that I am supposed to say billionaire buddies. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=153.72s)]
*  My God, can you imagine if she did that to Kamala Harris during the presidential election? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  Disaster. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=163.28s)]
*  I mean, I would be imagining a day where the remembering of the forgetting has happened [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=164.84s)]
*  already. I don't know if she would have the most nonsensical answer. Biden would be like, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=169.24s)]
*  listen here, Mac, okay? I remember when you and corn dog were coming at me, and then you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=175.24s)]
*  guys ate my uncle. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=181.52s)]
*  Do you remember when Biden called someone fat during his first campaign for president? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=182.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=189.36s)]
*  Someone asked him a challenging question, you just called him fat. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=190.44000000000003s)]
*  He's like, listen here, fat. And then we're like, hey, there's something wrong with him. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=194.0s)]
*  They're like, you're crazy. There's nothing wrong with him. Not just the way he speaks. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=198.12s)]
*  I'm like, all right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=202.0s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=203.0s)]
*  Anyways, but really, almost any corporate politician would melt with the simplest little [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=204.0s)]
*  thing. And here, the reason this brother is doing well, by the way, and resonating is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=208.84s)]
*  because he's actually passionate about the things that he's trying to fix in New York. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  Because you know why? Most of the people running are super rich. And so when you're super rich, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=219.04s)]
*  you don't know how disastrous it is that you can't make the rent in New York, right? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=224.32s)]
*  This brother seems to understand that most people can't make the rent. It's super difficult [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=229.88s)]
*  in a place like Manhattan, especially. So that's why he's running to fix those things. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  As opposed to I'm running for my own ego, and I have these scripted talking points for [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=240.16s)]
*  my consultant so I could win and not actually do any of those things, but feel good about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=245.84s)]
*  calling myself mayor. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=250.5s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about his politics. Some things I agree with, some I don't. But [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  nonetheless, out of the Democrats that he's running against- [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=257.6s)]
*  Why don't you cancel him? You don't agree with some of his positions. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=260.8s)]
*  Okay, hold, hold. When you look at the field of Democratic candidates who are running in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=263.24s)]
*  this primary, he stands out as the best one, in my opinion. And I'll tell you why in just [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=269.2s)]
*  a minute. So his full names are on Kwame Mamdani. He is an assembly member representing New [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=274.44s)]
*  York's 36th district. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=281.02s)]
*  So he does identify as a Democratic socialist. He wants to improve public transportation [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=282.84s)]
*  and make it free. I'm curious about how you would fund public transportation by making [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=288.4s)]
*  it free. It would be a little bit difficult, but I'm interested in hearing more about it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=296.24s)]
*  He also wants universal childcare that would be free at the point of service, which I think [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=300.6s)]
*  would be fantastic. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  I think that would actually help stimulate the economy because a lot of parents are struggling [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  with the high cost of childcare. He's only 33 years old. And so just to give you a little [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  bit more about him and how he differs from who's really polling at the top right now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=316.86s)]
*  So while many of his progressive rivals in the race have adopted more centrist positions [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  on certain issues like policing and public safety, Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, continues [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  to embrace left leaning views that have become less popular with voters in New York. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=334.44s)]
*  So for instance, he has become the standard bearer for progressive Democrats as a fresh [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=340.68s)]
*  faced alternative to his more veteran rivals. Notably, former governor Andrew Cuomo, he's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  actually the one who's polling at the top. Mayor Eric Adams and Brad Lander, the city [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=352.0s)]
*  controller, Mamdani underlined his campaign's core staples, free buses, a rent freeze, and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  city owned grocery stores. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=364.92s)]
*  So just to give you a sense of where he's at compared to the other candidates, other [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=367.48s)]
*  Democratic candidates. So this is data from the Honan Strategy Group. They found through [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=371.36s)]
*  their polling that Andrew Cuomo has about 41% of the support. But Mamdani comes in second [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=377.68s)]
*  at 18%. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  Not bad, he's beating Eric Adams. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=388.52s)]
*  And in the New York mayoral races, there's sometimes huge sprints at the end. So Andrew [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=389.52s)]
*  Yang was leading in the last race until Eric Adams sprinted at the end and then Yang fell [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  back a lot because there was a misstep, a couple of missteps in his campaign, etc. But [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=402.82s)]
*  it made a giant difference because a lot of people in New York pay attention to this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=407.2s)]
*  So when you've got a rural race and not a lot of people are paying attention to you, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=410.91999999999996s)]
*  you could buy that with money, right? But in a media center like New York, it's very [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=414.2s)]
*  difficult to do that. So now, and Bill de Blasio was third or fourth place when I said [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  he'd go to the top and he did. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=424.32s)]
*  So you see these big swings all the time. So he could still surge and win. Now Anna's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=426.64s)]
*  right and now that we know a little bit more about him, there's some parts of his policies [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=430.96s)]
*  I don't agree with. For example, I don't think a rent freeze is the right way to go because [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=436.09999999999997s)]
*  that's artificial. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=440.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=441.44s)]
*  And it could create other consequences that are not right. But caring about how bad the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=442.44s)]
*  rent is, is super important, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=446.2s)]
*  Yeah, you do need to get the price of rent down considerably. When you have price control [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=448.56s)]
*  policies implemented, it does tend to have unexpected consequences and it ends up driving [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=455.36s)]
*  the cost of housing up. Some of the rent control policies, for instance, especially in LA, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=461.88s)]
*  has unfortunately discouraged new developments for new housing, which we desperately need. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=467.76s)]
*  Part of the reason why it's so expensive is we need more housing, more inventory. And [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=473.8s)]
*  by the way, the other area is where he kind of differs from Cuomo on policing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=479.96s)]
*  So look, whether you like it or not, it does seem as though the voters in New York City [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=486.68s)]
*  have kind of soured on some of the left-wing perspectives on policing. And I think that's [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=491.04s)]
*  what's kind of holding him back compared to Cuomo. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=496.76s)]
*  So according to the New York Times, Cuomo has already made running against the far left [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=499.48s)]
*  a feature of his campaign without mentioning Mamdani by name. So he actually has called [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  defund the police the three dumbest words ever uttered in politics, even though he actually [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=510.8s)]
*  signed some police reforms into law when he was mayor. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=515.72s)]
*  But- [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=519.88s)]
*  That's not an even though, by the way. We're in favor of police reforms. Defund the police [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=520.88s)]
*  is a completely different thing. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=523.4s)]
*  So Mamdani though, by contrast, has called for cutting police spending in areas like [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=525.0s)]
*  its communications office and eliminating its strategic response group. So- [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=530.68s)]
*  So look, he has interesting ideas, free buses, and he seems to care about the people. And [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=537.84s)]
*  so that's why I'd take him over somebody who was a corporatist like Andrew Cuomo any day, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=544.08s)]
*  right? Or Eric Adams, who's got the corruption problems and so we're asking you guys the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=548.2s)]
*  same poll in a live chat shows 6 to 8 o'clock Eastern every day. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=551.88s)]
*  So be part of the show. That's why I mentioned that. But and so and that's interesting, 40% [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=557.92s)]
*  saying Cuomo. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=565.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=566.24s)]
*  So that's super interesting to me. And some like normie Democrats still have fond feelings [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=567.24s)]
*  for Cuomo for whatever reasons, etc. And look, I'm not trying to hate on anybody, right? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=572.08s)]
*  Other than come on, Eric Adams, are we really? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=576.88s)]
*  No, I'm gonna hate on Cuomo. Like Cuomo made, I know that everyone likes to focus on the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=579.48s)]
*  sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against him, which ended up ousting him from [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=585.32s)]
*  office. And that was bad. I'm not trying to minimize that. But his decision to send back [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=590.2800000000001s)]
*  elderly nursing home patients to the nursing homes in the middle of COVID, thus spreading [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=597.12s)]
*  COVID within the nursing homes and killing a bunch of people. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=602.88s)]
*  I mean, that was horrific. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=606.8s)]
*  No and his corruption with like the real estate markets in New York, I can't stand it. I can't [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=610.04s)]
*  stand it. He's like a classic corporatist. And the corporatists are all corrupt by definition. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=614.76s)]
*  They take tons of corporate money and those serve those donors. Okay, so that's why to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=620.5999999999999s)]
*  me I wouldn't vote for Cuomo on a boat. I wouldn't vote for him on a goat. Okay, so [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm going mom, Donnie if those are the choices. But unfortunately, he's making the same mistake [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=629.8000000000001s)]
*  that's driving me crazy with other candidates. You're not gonna win an election in New York [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=636.9200000000001s)]
*  if you're perceived as not being tough on crime. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=641.4s)]
*  You don't have to be draconian. You don't have to do weird old things that are right [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=644.12s)]
*  wing and like, I'm gonna go after black and brown people again. No, don't do that. Don't do that, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=647.96s)]
*  right? But at the same time saying you're gonna get rid of the strategic center, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=654.44s)]
*  it's terrible optics, terrible optics. At a bare minimum, I don't even agree with the policy, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=658.2s)]
*  let alone the optics. You know what's not terrible optics though? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=663.6400000000001s)]
*  The next clip you're about to watch. Okay, let's take a look. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=667.08s)]
*  Jordan, would you fuck me? Are you married? Yes. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=669.72s)]
*  Who you married to? White woman, Latina, Arab? She's Arab. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=673.24s)]
*  And what are you? Are you Arab, Indian? What are you? You look ambiguous. You look weird. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=676.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm an Indian, Uganda, New York. Okay, so you're African American. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=681.24s)]
*  So would you claim the African American status like Elon Musk? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=684.6s)]
*  No, I would not. Why not? You're African, but you're African, right? I knew you grew up there. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=687.32s)]
*  I am. Your middle name is Kwame. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=690.7600000000001s)]
*  I am. I'm proud to be Ugandan. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=692.44s)]
*  Okay. But I think that that is misleading. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=693.88s)]
*  And were the Indian and Ugandans colonialists or did you come [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=695.96s)]
*  happy? Did you come to fuck it up or did you come in peace? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=698.44s)]
*  We came in peace. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=701.5600000000001s)]
*  And I know your father's a professor. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=703.48s)]
*  My father's a professor. My family came from Gujarat to Uganda about 200 years ago. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=704.9200000000001s)]
*  So the caste system, what are you? Like Brahmin? Are you like untouchable? What are you? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=709.88s)]
*  You look a little light skinned. I'm somewhere in the middle. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=714.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, so you're a piece of shit. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=716.2s)]
*  No, he honestly handled it really, really well. And he's likable. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=719.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's likable. He seems to not take himself too seriously. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=723.0s)]
*  That goes a long way in politics. So. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=727.88s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a small thing, but I like it that he's not cheesy enough to call himself [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=730.12s)]
*  African American even though he's from Uganda. He's smart enough not to. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=735.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, don't do that. So he's South Asian and who cares, right? But at least he's doing it [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=738.9200000000001s)]
*  right unlike Elon. So again, I like his principles. I like that he has different ideas and cares about [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=745.96s)]
*  the people. And so I'm not alone. I'd go with him even though I don't agree with some of his policies. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=752.44s)]
*  Yeah. And by the way, guys, it is possible not to agree with some policies and still support [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=757.0s)]
*  a candidate or a person. Yeah. And at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. We don't live in [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=762.44s)]
*  New York City. New York City dwellers get to decide. Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=766.2800000000001s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=771.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdTUcB5nHk&t=775.96s)]
