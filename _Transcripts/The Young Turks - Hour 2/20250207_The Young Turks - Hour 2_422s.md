The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Elon Musk Tweets HUMILIATING Declaration Of Love
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc)
*  Is it real love? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=0.0s)]
*  Check yes or no. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=1.74s)]
*  At least that's the situation we [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=3.04s)]
*  have before us when reading some [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=5.22s)]
*  very hilarious tweets from Elon [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=7.26s)]
*  Musk, who tweeted this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=9.46s)]
*  I love real Donald Trump as much as [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=11.42s)]
*  a straight man can love another man. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=14.1s)]
*  Cool. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=18.1s)]
*  The replies to that post, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=19.62s)]
*  here's Laura Loomer. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=21.34s)]
*  She suggested Musk was a bandwagoner [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=22.94s)]
*  writing, I am a day one Trump [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=25.5s)]
*  loyalist, not many years ago. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=27.66s)]
*  Many people can say they have been [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=30.0s)]
*  with Trump since day one, but [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=32.74s)]
*  I can, hashtag loyal Loomer. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=35.08s)]
*  What a cabal of alphas, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=37.64s)]
*  licking butt. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=41.24s)]
*  Cat term chimed in. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=44.22s)]
*  He also wrote, this is going to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  melt down the left. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=48.96s)]
*  Guys, I just want to say it's not [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=52.44s)]
*  a meltdown. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  It's like someone cutting their own [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=58.62s)]
*  balls off to own the libs. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=61.78s)]
*  No, I'm happy with this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=64.26s)]
*  This is entertaining. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=66.86s)]
*  That's just my take. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=68.5s)]
*  You didn't own the left, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=69.78s)]
*  you kind of own yourself. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=71.34s)]
*  This is really creepy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=73.14s)]
*  But JR, what are your thoughts? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=74.7s)]
*  I want you guys to take a look at [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=76.26s)]
*  comment sections on X. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=77.7s)]
*  God, I know it's so suck. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=79.06s)]
*  My God. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=80.14s)]
*  But this is where the propaganda [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=80.66s)]
*  happens. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=82.86s)]
*  This is the reason why Elon Musk [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=83.7s)]
*  kind of bought Twitter. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=86.92s)]
*  Because it's not his statement. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  It's not his original post. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  He knows that's a ridiculous and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=92.36s)]
*  stupid post that people [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=93.64s)]
*  are going to make fun of. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=94.56s)]
*  But scroll through the comments [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=95.64s)]
*  because it's become such a cess [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  pool of right wing propaganda that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=99.06s)]
*  everything from bots to just [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  crazies are all about. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=103.0s)]
*  It eventually shifts to just more [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=104.92s)]
*  love for Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=106.92s)]
*  The next love for Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=108.0s)]
*  Trump is my deity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=109.2s)]
*  Trump is sitting next to Jesus. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=110.4s)]
*  Trump has been blessed by Jesus. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  And next, you've read 105 of these [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=113.4s)]
*  comments that all have this drum [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=115.33999999999999s)]
*  beat of Trump is a deity. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=117.38s)]
*  Trump is untouchable. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  Trump is this, or Elon is that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=120.3s)]
*  It started with CatTart. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=122.94s)]
*  It'll be positive on their side and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=123.86s)]
*  this weird, bro-ish, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=126.33999999999999s)]
*  the only thing that matters to you [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  is angering the libs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=130.38s)]
*  There's no evidence that you've [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=132.14s)]
*  angered anybody. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=133.74s)]
*  But CatTart will write, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=134.7s)]
*  this is going to melt down the left. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=135.82s)]
*  So that it's now ingrained in your [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=137.82s)]
*  head, this is melting down the left. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=139.42s)]
*  That's your whole motivation for [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=141.14s)]
*  even being on this app anymore. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  There's no actual post that means [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=145.0s)]
*  what the post is supposed to take [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=146.88s)]
*  care of. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=148.64s)]
*  It's just supposed to progress that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=149.28s)]
*  next level of propaganda so [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  that you're so deep in this muck of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=153.04s)]
*  BS and love and constant groveling [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=155.04s)]
*  to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=157.28s)]
*  You can't find your way out of it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Check out, there was a time, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=162.16s)]
*  it was later at night and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=163.48s)]
*  I was read through comments, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  because I always avoid them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=165.72s)]
*  I was like, wow, this is straight [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=167.04s)]
*  out of a movie with how blatantly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=169.64s)]
*  nasty and directly proper [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=172.16s)]
*  propagandish this type of thing is. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  He didn't write that to say [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=177.52s)]
*  anything about, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=178.4s)]
*  everybody knows that he's grifting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=179.0s)]
*  off of Donald Trump to make some [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  money. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=181.68s)]
*  But I mean, you lose that once you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=182.28s)]
*  read 100 comments that say, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=184.08s)]
*  that's right, Donald Trump is your [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=185.68s)]
*  God, he is your deity, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=187.8s)]
*  he is omnipotent. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=189.44s)]
*  It's crazy, it's really weird. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=191.32s)]
*  I just hope the AI isn't learning [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=192.84s)]
*  off it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  It is, it is learning, especially [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=195.12s)]
*  off of X or Twitter, whatever. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  And the question is, why can't men [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=199.32s)]
*  just love each other, whatever [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  happened to brotherhood? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  The thing is, on the left, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=204.4s)]
*  we are way more open to things like [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=206.0s)]
*  that than they are on the right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=207.9s)]
*  So why would we, of all people, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=209.9s)]
*  be melting down over something [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=211.46s)]
*  like this? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=213.10000000000002s)]
*  But why do they have to be so [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=213.94s)]
*  weird about it? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=215.38000000000002s)]
*  It's like what we were talking [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=216.5s)]
*  about in the last story. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=217.54000000000002s)]
*  It's like, Elon Musk, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=218.26000000000002s)]
*  you are doing way too much, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  which makes me question everything [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=220.82000000000002s)]
*  that I wasn't, the things that I [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  wasn't already questioning about [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=224.3s)]
*  you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  We are not melting down, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=226.5s)]
*  I just think it's funny and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=227.86s)]
*  kind of weird. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=229.24s)]
*  But JR is 100% right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  I've always hated Twitter, but [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=231.94s)]
*  I really only get on there anymore [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=233.06s)]
*  if I absolutely need to for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=234.52s)]
*  work-related stuff. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=235.8s)]
*  It's all bots, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  you can't trust anything over [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=238.52s)]
*  there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=240.04s)]
*  It feels like when MySpace started [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=240.56s)]
*  to die, it was all just weird ads [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=242.48s)]
*  and spammy comments everywhere. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=244.32s)]
*  But it's by design now, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=246.56s)]
*  it's happening on purpose. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=247.56s)]
*  It's not being infiltrated by [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=248.72s)]
*  these things, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=250.24s)]
*  they're being put in place there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=251.0s)]
*  That's the reason why Elon Musk [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=253.24s)]
*  bought it, and that's why he took [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=254.96s)]
*  over control of it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=256.68s)]
*  He fired all the developers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=258.08s)]
*  And even on Meta, on our other [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=260.16s)]
*  social media platforms on Instagram [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=261.82s)]
*  and Facebook, he said, Zuckerberg [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  said, I'm going to flood it with [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=266.14s)]
*  bots, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=267.94s)]
*  So you're not even going to know [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=268.58s)]
*  what's real and what is fake. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=270.22s)]
*  It's all just a digital hellscape. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=271.7s)]
*  And I hope that they tank their own [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=274.58000000000004s)]
*  platforms. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=276.7s)]
*  The problem is, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=277.82s)]
*  they probably won't because what's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  going to happen is people are going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  to say, you know what? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=282.7s)]
*  I can tell the difference between [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=284.14s)]
*  a bot and real person. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=285.62s)]
*  I know what's real, but no, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  nobody knows what's real, right? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=288.1s)]
*  We saw with that story about [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=289.7s)]
*  what it go, right? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=291.4s)]
*  People would just see a story and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=292.48s)]
*  then say, this is what it is. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=294.12s)]
*  This is real until it gets all the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=295.64s)]
*  way up to the White House. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=297.32s)]
*  Because people like Elon Musk is [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  there validating all these crazy [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=300.64s)]
*  claims and saying, yeah, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=302.52s)]
*  yeah, you're right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=303.96s)]
*  This is obviously a huge waste of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=304.88s)]
*  taxpayer dollars. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=306.56s)]
*  And Trump is saying, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=307.68s)]
*  this is the biggest scandal I've [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=308.6s)]
*  ever seen, right? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=310.04s)]
*  He doesn't care, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  And nobody cares about this except [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=312.2s)]
*  for the people on social media. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=313.96s)]
*  And then it all just becomes like [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=315.92s)]
*  this weird cesspool where everybody [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  is just like feeding each other's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  crazy until it's not going to be [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=321.74s)]
*  fun the next few years while we're [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=323.7s)]
*  trying to deal with this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=325.78s)]
*  All the bots on social media plus [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=327.46s)]
*  all the AI content that really [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  people should be able to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=331.4s)]
*  distinguish. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=332.9s)]
*  Even the really obvious AI content [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=333.78s)]
*  that they still get fooled by it [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=336.06s)]
*  all. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=338.06s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=338.58s)]
*  I don't really use X either. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=339.78s)]
*  So you open it up and you look in [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=343.18s)]
*  and it's like, wait, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  Musk making out. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  You close the door and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=349.4s)]
*  you go about your business. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  And then you open it again and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=351.52s)]
*  it's like a bunch of people [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=353.0s)]
*  applauding and essentially typing [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=354.4s)]
*  with one hand if you know what I [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=356.35999999999996s)]
*  mean, way to make out guys, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=358.11999999999995s)]
*  we're all such straight alpha [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=359.85999999999996s)]
*  sigma boys here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  Let me shut the door and leave. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=362.35999999999996s)]
*  Not that there's anything wrong [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=366.32s)]
*  with that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  The big question is what does [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump think about it? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=369.23999999999995s)]
*  At least that was the big question [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=370.52s)]
*  on one reporter's mind when he was [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  asked about it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=373.44s)]
*  So here is Trump's response. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=374.2s)]
*  You want to say today, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=375.82s)]
*  I love Donald Trump as much as [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=377.5s)]
*  he's a great man and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=379.46s)]
*  can love another man. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=380.64s)]
*  What does the first lady think [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  about that? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=384.17999999999995s)]
*  I think she'll be okay with it [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=385.34s)]
*  somehow. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  Because we haven't touched each [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=390.26s)]
*  other in a very long time. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=392.06s)]
*  In fact, I think she's sleeping [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=393.65999999999997s)]
*  with Gavin Newsom. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8VoRqpXMc&t=395.06s)]
