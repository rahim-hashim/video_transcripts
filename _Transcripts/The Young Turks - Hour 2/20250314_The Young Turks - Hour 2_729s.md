TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Trump: "MSDNC and CNN Are Illegal & Should Be Taken Care Of"
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg)
*  I believe that CNN and MSDNC, who literally write 97.6% bad about me are political arms [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Democrat Party. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=9.1s)]
*  And in my opinion, they're really corrupt and they're illegal. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=11.28s)]
*  What they do is illegal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=15.48s)]
*  All right, so during a speech at the Department of Justice today, Donald Trump made it abundantly [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=16.48s)]
*  clear how he feels about the free press. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't care a whole lot about it, surprise, surprise. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=25.16s)]
*  It's not that surprising, we'll get into why it shouldn't be surprising later on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=28.32s)]
*  But speaking to prosecutors and law enforcement officers, he suggested that cable news like [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=32.88s)]
*  CNN and MSNBC are illegal because they're critical of him and that's just not true. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  So this isn't the first time that he has suggested that cable news outlets that he doesn't like [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=44.8s)]
*  should be taken care of. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  In January, he posted this to Truth Social and it says, MSDNC is even worse than CNN. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=50.72s)]
*  They shouldn't even have a right to broadcast only in America. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Yes, only in America because we have a Bill of Rights and the freedom of press is in the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Bill of Rights. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  So yes, only in America. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  He didn't stop there though. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  During today's presser, he went after print journalists as well because no one is safe. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=75.12s)]
*  And these newspapers are really no different than a highly paid political operative. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=76.44s)]
*  And it has to stop. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=81.96s)]
*  It has to be illegal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=83.25999999999999s)]
*  Influencing judges and it's really changing law and it just cannot be legal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=85.08s)]
*  I don't believe it's legal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  And they do it in total coordination with each other and everything we do, we're restoring [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=95.84s)]
*  law, restoring order and restoring public safety in America. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=101.16s)]
*  That's what we wanna do. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  I like how he says he doesn't believe it's legal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  You're the President of the United States, just check. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=109.28s)]
*  I'm sure one of your advisors can tell you that it is completely legal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  But apparently it's also illegal for us to not be buying Teslas, so I don't know. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=115.4s)]
*  But this is just the latest in Trump and his administration's crusade against the media. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=119.72s)]
*  This is nothing new, we're all very familiar with this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  And here's what has already been happening. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=127.08s)]
*  This is reporting from NBC News. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=129.32s)]
*  It says Brendan Carr, the newly installed Federal Communications Commission Chair, has [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=130.88s)]
*  As launched investigations into NPR and PBS, two media companies often targeted with conservative [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  rhetoric over perceived liberal bias and their government funding, over on air recognition [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=142.2s)]
*  of financial sponsors, and into a San Francisco radio station over its broadcast of the live [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=148.28s)]
*  locations of federal immigration agents. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=154.0s)]
*  The FCC has also reopened a probe of CBS for news distortion, which are rules around the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=156.72s)]
*  intentional falsification of the news that it has rarely tapped in the past. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=163.4s)]
*  And it reopened a probe of ABC over how it handled a debate between Trump and Democratic [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  presidential nominee Kamala Harris. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=175.84s)]
*  Carr has also opened an inquiry into Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, over its promotion [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=178.68s)]
*  of DEI programs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=184.96s)]
*  And Trump kicked the Associated Press out of the White House for refusing to call the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=186.88s)]
*  Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  So Michael, let's start with you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  What are your initial thoughts here? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=195.96s)]
*  Should we be surprised that it's come to this? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=197.44s)]
*  Because I always go back to 2015, because I remember when Trump was very active on Twitter, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  then Twitter, and he was starting to be taken seriously as a politician or a potential presidential [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=205.08s)]
*  candidate. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=211.44s)]
*  And he was railing about the fake news, and that was such a red flag even back then. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=212.44s)]
*  And maybe it wasn't enough of a red flag to enough people, but it was there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=217.36s)]
*  It was there for all of us to see. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=220.84s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=221.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, I mean, the fact that he was saying that this is not legal, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=222.84s)]
*  he's saying this at the Justice Department, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=227.08s)]
*  I mean, these remarks were made at the Department of Justice to the highest law enforcement [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=230.08s)]
*  agency in the country. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=235.28s)]
*  So yeah, not only does he have people around him who can answer the question that you were [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=237.04s)]
*  asking, it's also that he was in a room full of them today when he was making these remarks. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=241.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, when you talk about freedom of the press and picking the press, I mean, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=246.44s)]
*  this has been something he's done. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=250.4s)]
*  It's not even two months since he's in office, which is astonishing, but it's something he [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  did at the outset by selecting who can be inside the press room. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=257.04s)]
*  There were traditionally the associate press would get the first question. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=262.12s)]
*  There would be a press pool that was made up of a mix of people in the press. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=266.1s)]
*  And so when you were part of that pool, I would go in there and either have access or [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=270.16s)]
*  ask questions of the president or whoever the person that was at the podium, most often [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=275.16s)]
*  the president and there was a free press. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=279.66s)]
*  You were able to ask these questions and the people that they kept out were the fringe [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=282.26s)]
*  people on any of the spectrums, on any of the polls. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=285.78s)]
*  Maybe that wasn't even a good idea, but what he's done is he is handpicked who's able to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=290.7s)]
*  do this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=296.74s)]
*  And those were the earmarks of fascism, controlling the press, controlling the message, not only [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=297.94s)]
*  to the people who work for the other agencies, that they are NPR, for example, CBS, ABC, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=304.1s)]
*  that he's president, that if you don't say what we like, you are not going to be part [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=311.06s)]
*  of what we do. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  It's interesting that he's picking on the newspapers because Jeff Bezos, who owns the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  Washington Post, is now one of his cronies. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=318.36s)]
*  So there is a little bit of irony there, but that's exactly what's happening here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  And it's just part of a broader plan. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=325.94s)]
*  He said that he is the president of order. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=327.92s)]
*  All he has done is sown chaos. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=330.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=331.94s)]
*  And who's going to really tell him the truth? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=333.65999999999997s)]
*  Who around him dares to tell him the truth? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=335.46s)]
*  Because if he doesn't want to hear it, he doesn't want to hear it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=337.3s)]
*  It is a free press, supposedly, for now, but for how much longer? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=339.5s)]
*  We know that he idolizes people like Putin. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=344.0s)]
*  And in Russia, they too claim to have free speech, but they passed a series of laws, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  extremism type things where they can put anything under that umbrella if you say anything out [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=352.65999999999997s)]
*  of the pocket about Putin or the Russian army. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=357.29999999999995s)]
*  Or just, I don't know, maybe good morning one day. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  They can throw you in jail or, as we know, you suddenly may be poisoned, end up dead. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  So look at what Trump has done already, as Michael pointed out in Jazz, the story elaborated [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=368.14000000000004s)]
*  on, and he's still not happy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=374.1s)]
*  He's still railing against the media, even though he has significant cronies, social [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  media outlets who seemingly have kowtowed. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=381.94s)]
*  ABC paid him what, $12 million because George Stephanopoulos told the truth. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=384.74s)]
*  I mean, what did he say that was so bad and worth $12 million settlement? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=390.26000000000005s)]
*  There you go. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=393.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and I think it's interesting because here in the United States, we identify with [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=395.14000000000004s)]
*  a lot of the Western world, specifically Western Europe, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=400.06s)]
*  And we say these are our allies, these are the people who are most like us on the world [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=403.78000000000003s)]
*  stage. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=407.74s)]
*  But really, economically at least, we function more, and also militarily, we function more [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=408.62s)]
*  like China and Russia, right? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=414.42s)]
*  So there's the US, China, and Russia. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=416.22s)]
*  And look at those two countries and look at how closely its citizens are watching, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=418.82s)]
*  look at how tightly the governments hold the reins on all aspects of the government and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=423.05999999999995s)]
*  life in their countries. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=428.7s)]
*  And so the United States, I think that we are a little arrogant and in the sense that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=430.53999999999996s)]
*  we have our constitution, we have our Bill of Rights, and we have our freedoms, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=436.38s)]
*  And we forget that those things, we call them inalienable rights, but we still have to fight [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=440.9s)]
*  for them and we still have to maintain and protect them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=444.73999999999995s)]
*  And I think we forget about that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=447.42s)]
*  And to Sharon's point, you're right, we're already seeing a lot of these big media corporations, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=448.98s)]
*  including people who are just more middle of the line. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=456.38s)]
*  The fact that he's targeting people like ABC and CBS is a little kind of crazy to me. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=459.86s)]
*  But even them, MSNBC, CNN, we're seeing huge overhauls of their programming, of their presenters. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=465.26s)]
*  And they're all kind of trying to pander to Donald Trump because they're scared that he's [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=473.06s)]
*  going to take legal action against them, not just against the networks, but against [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=476.94s)]
*  the individual presenters. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=480.86s)]
*  So this is a very tenuous time that we're entering into. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=482.14s)]
*  It is very scary. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=485.34s)]
*  But as I was mentioning earlier, we really shouldn't be very surprised because he started [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=486.42s)]
*  10 years ago with this type of rhetoric. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=490.98s)]
*  And at the time, that rhetoric was seen to be fascistic or at least heading that way. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=493.86s)]
*  The minute he started calling the news the fake news without having any proof that they [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=499.1s)]
*  were lying or making things up, even as the press had to continually defend themselves [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=503.5s)]
*  and defend their reporting and they were found to have done what they were supposed to do, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=508.9s)]
*  he still kept calling it the fake news. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=513.14s)]
*  He has completely dismantled any kind of trust that the American people have in the media, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=515.02s)]
*  especially on the right wing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=520.42s)]
*  And the problem is, the issue that we're seeing today is that nobody knows what's real anymore. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=522.3s)]
*  Nobody has any grasp of reality because somebody's telling you one thing, you look for proof [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=527.78s)]
*  and it's all a little bit muddled. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=532.5400000000001s)]
*  You don't know what you can trust anymore. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=534.34s)]
*  Throw in some AI on top of that and the control of your social media platforms and it's chaos. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=536.62s)]
*  And you can't assume that that's not the goal here, that chaos is not the goal. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=542.1s)]
*  And he wants people to feel as if they don't know anything, that they don't have access [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=546.86s)]
*  to information. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=550.86s)]
*  And if they do, they can't trust that information that they have access to. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=551.86s)]
*  This whole idea of fake news is probably going to be the worst and most enduring legacy of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=555.9s)]
*  Trump years from now when people look back at this because it has taken trust away. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=562.54s)]
*  And he continues to do it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=568.22s)]
*  It has worked well for him because what I've found going around the country and talking [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=569.62s)]
*  to people at Trump rallies is that they are getting their news as they say elsewhere from [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=573.4599999999999s)]
*  other sources, not even Fox News. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=578.54s)]
*  Fox News has sold out as far as they're concerned. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=580.78s)]
*  So they go to other sources and of course those other sources are unedited, they're [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=584.08s)]
*  not fact checked. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=588.0s)]
*  And the destruction of what we had come to know as a free media here, a flawed media, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=589.9200000000001s)]
*  there's no question, but the flaws are worked around and we understand them and we try and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=596.2s)]
*  repair them, etc. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=600.72s)]
*  But that's gonna be the legacy, the lasting legacy of the Trump years. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=602.24s)]
*  He will be gone, but there will be this idea that who can you trust and why nothing matters [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=607.32s)]
*  anymore because of that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=613.68s)]
*  It's really difficult. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=614.88s)]
*  Yeah, I agree, flaws and all. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=615.88s)]
*  I also would add that I think media as we know it is gone and perhaps gone forever. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  Some of that might be okay and it's not gonna be resurrected in the same form. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=623.48s)]
*  But I think the real danger is we're not going back to what we had before. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=627.84s)]
*  What emerges after Trump, there must be an after Trump, we'll see. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=633.4s)]
*  One final thought to Michael's point about Trump supporters, especially getting their [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=638.36s)]
*  news from alternate sources. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=642.6s)]
*  Those sources, they're not held to the same journalistic standards that a lot of these [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=644.84s)]
*  media companies are and are supposed to be. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=648.44s)]
*  So if they say the wrong thing, they're not likely to get sued for it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=651.12s)]
*  They're not gonna be held to the same national standards that these companies do. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=654.9200000000001s)]
*  And I think those are the things that keep those companies trustworthy, or at least their [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=660.64s)]
*  intentions are to just tell the right to say the right thing and to report what is factual. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=664.72s)]
*  And that is such an important check on our media. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=670.56s)]
*  And a lot of these YouTubers and things like that, they're simply not held to that same [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=674.1999999999999s)]
*  standard and that is very dangerous. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=677.64s)]
*  At every network I worked at, there was a script approval process. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=680.16s)]
*  You couldn't just put it on, right? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=683.96s)]
*  You'd have to send it to get approved and those people would be both looking at it for [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=686.0799999999999s)]
*  syntax and grammar, but also for fact checking and truth. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=690.48s)]
*  And that's gone now. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=695.84s)]
*  I mean, that doesn't exist in the streaming world. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=697.76s)]
*  I don't think the constructs are there for it, but it does make a difference on how people [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=700.7199999999999s)]
*  get their information. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=705.52s)]
*  Yeah, even here, we have a whole production team. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=706.52s)]
*  A lot of work goes into these shows. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=709.88s)]
*  So we have to be very careful and we try to be, we do our best, but be careful where you [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=711.8399999999999s)]
*  get your news from and always double check things. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=717.0799999999999s)]
*  Even us, if we say something that doesn't sound right, then let us know. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=719.8s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=722.92s)]
*  Absolutely not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SRQxObwlvg&t=726.16s)]
