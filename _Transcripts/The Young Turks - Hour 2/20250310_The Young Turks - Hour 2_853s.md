TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Trump Pumps The Breaks on DOGE, More Internal TURMOIL
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY)
*  It appears that patience with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=0.0s)]
*  Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=2.38s)]
*  both from the American people and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=5.32s)]
*  even among some of Donald Trump's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=7.66s)]
*  cabinet officials is growing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=10.06s)]
*  thinner and thinner. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=12.1s)]
*  And now according to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  the Washington Post, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  the Doge organization is [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  reconsidering their whole strategy [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=18.12s)]
*  of move fast and break things. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=20.48s)]
*  So last week, President Donald [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=22.56s)]
*  Trump announced that his cabinet [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=24.72s)]
*  officials rather than Doge and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=27.04s)]
*  Elon Musk would be making the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=29.22s)]
*  decisions and carrying out the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=31.1s)]
*  firings of federal workers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=33.14s)]
*  So he wrote the following on [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=35.14s)]
*  Truth Social, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=36.9s)]
*  Doge has been an incredible [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=37.94s)]
*  success and now that we have my [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=39.7s)]
*  cabinet in place, I have instructed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=41.7s)]
*  the secretaries and leadership to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=44.18s)]
*  work with Doge on cost cutting [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=46.58s)]
*  measures and staffing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=48.58s)]
*  As the secretaries learn about and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=50.58s)]
*  understand the people working for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=52.58s)]
*  the various departments, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=54.74s)]
*  they can be very precise as to who [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=56.46s)]
*  will remain and who will go. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=58.58s)]
*  We say the scalpel rather than [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=60.54s)]
*  the hatchet. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=62.66s)]
*  Now in a later interview, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=63.74s)]
*  I should just note that Trump said [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=65.46s)]
*  yeah, it's going to be like the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=67.62s)]
*  cabinet secretaries and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=69.54s)]
*  the heads of these departments will [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=71.18s)]
*  make the firing decisions. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=73.5s)]
*  And if they don't fire enough [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=75.42s)]
*  people, that's when Doge will come [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=77.3s)]
*  in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=79.5s)]
*  Okay, so nothing's changing. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=80.02s)]
*  There is no scalpel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=81.98s)]
*  But what this does communicate to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=83.22s)]
*  me was is that Trump reacts to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=85.3s)]
*  backlash specifically from his [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=87.7s)]
*  base. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  Now there have been all of these [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=90.54s)]
*  arguments that all these town hall [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=92.54s)]
*  protesters, it's AstroTurf, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=94.7s)]
*  they're all Democrats, they're not [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  actually Republican voters. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  But it looks like there are some [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=100.86s)]
*  Republican voters who are not fans [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=102.58s)]
*  of what Doge is doing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=104.54s)]
*  And that message is getting across [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=106.7s)]
*  to Donald Trump, which is why he [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  would put out a statement like [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=110.02000000000001s)]
*  this, that's my read of it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=111.42s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  I think that he definitely has [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=113.86s)]
*  a sense that there's a public [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=115.62s)]
*  backlash. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=117.38s)]
*  I think part of it too is that he [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=118.02s)]
*  knew that this massive taking axe [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  or chainsaw, whatever approach [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=122.58s)]
*  would have consequences. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=124.78s)]
*  I think that's kind of why he likes [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=126.7s)]
*  having Elon be the mascot. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=128.7s)]
*  There's a bit of a deflection, but [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=130.54s)]
*  I think more so than that, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=132.9s)]
*  honestly, Ana, are these actual [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=134.62s)]
*  cabinet heads, agency heads being [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=136.98s)]
*  like, bro, you put me up for [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=139.62s)]
*  nomination for the president, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=141.54s)]
*  you put me up for nomination so [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=143.86s)]
*  I could run this department. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=146.18s)]
*  I could be doing something else [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=148.38000000000002s)]
*  with my time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  If the idea is that I don't get to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=152.46s)]
*  run this and Elon's going to do [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  it, then what is the point of me [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=155.82000000000002s)]
*  being here? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=157.78s)]
*  It's not a hard argument to make. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  And as much as we don't like [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  Trump's idea of what's going to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  work to make American people's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=164.34s)]
*  lives better, I don't think he's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=166.18s)]
*  a complete idiot and is immune to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=168.3s)]
*  a sort of human outreach from [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=170.38000000000002s)]
*  the people that he handpicked to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=172.22s)]
*  head up these agencies being like, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=174.58s)]
*  bro, let me do my job. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=177.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=178.86s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=182.58s)]
*  Trump posted that statement [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=183.66s)]
*  following a cabinet meeting that, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=185.5s)]
*  according to the New York Times, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=187.74s)]
*  led to a very fiery confrontation [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=189.84s)]
*  between Elon Musk and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=191.9s)]
*  members of Donald Trump's cabinet. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=193.18s)]
*  So I'll give you a specific [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=195.5s)]
*  example, some of you may have [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=196.62s)]
*  already heard about this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=197.9s)]
*  But apparently, Musk accused [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=200.78s)]
*  not firing any State Department [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=203.22s)]
*  employees except for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  one staff member from Doge. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=207.22s)]
*  So Musk was not being truthful, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=210.1s)]
*  Rubio said. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=212.45999999999998s)]
*  What about the more than 1,500 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=214.42s)]
*  State Department officials who took [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=216.33999999999997s)]
*  early retirement in buyouts? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  Didn't they count as layoffs? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=220.54s)]
*  He asked sarcastically whether [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  Musk wanted him to rehire all [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=224.5s)]
*  those people just so he could make [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=226.26s)]
*  a show of firing them again. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=228.42s)]
*  Then he laid out his detailed plans [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=230.7s)]
*  for reorganizing the State [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=232.5s)]
*  Department. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=233.82s)]
*  Apparently, Musk was unimpressed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=234.7s)]
*  He told Rubio he was good on TV [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  with the clear subtext being that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  he was not good for much else. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=242.62s)]
*  Because Elon Musk is, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=245.89999999999998s)]
*  every time I see him in public or [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  in TV or whatever, I think to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=249.66s)]
*  myself, wow, he's really killing it [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=251.66s)]
*  with his messaging, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=254.34s)]
*  not cringe at all. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=255.98s)]
*  Anyway, apparently, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  their argument lasted for [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=258.54s)]
*  an uncomfortable amount of time [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=260.42s)]
*  until Trump finally took the side [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=262.66s)]
*  of Marco Rubio, little Marco. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=265.02s)]
*  So Trump finally intervened to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=267.5s)]
*  defend Rubio as doing a great job. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=269.7s)]
*  Rubio has a lot to deal with, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=272.66s)]
*  the President said. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=274.54s)]
*  He is very busy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=276.1s)]
*  He is always traveling and on TV, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=277.42s)]
*  and he has an agency to run, so [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=279.58s)]
*  everyone just needs to work [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=281.58s)]
*  together. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=283.26s)]
*  Trump has since denied that there [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=284.46s)]
*  was any conflict between Elon Musk [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=286.22s)]
*  and Marco Rubio, posting on X that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=288.06s)]
*  Elon and Marco have a great [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=289.98s)]
*  relationship. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=291.58s)]
*  Any statement other than that is [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=292.38s)]
*  fake news, which to me communicates [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=294.5s)]
*  they had a knockdown drag out [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  fight. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=298.74s)]
*  It was even worse than the New York [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=299.58s)]
*  Times is reporting. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=301.62s)]
*  But we say all that to basically [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=303.02s)]
*  note that Doge is running into [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=305.38s)]
*  significant headwinds, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=307.58s)]
*  a significant pushback within [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=309.62s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=311.86s)]
*  Maybe not from Trump himself, but [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=313.78s)]
*  we're going to explain some of the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=316.22s)]
*  why the organization is looking to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=318.62s)]
*  make changes, we're going to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=321.02s)]
*  explain that in just a minute. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=323.06s)]
*  But also it's worth noting how the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=325.86s)]
*  American people feel about Doge. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=327.82s)]
*  And the answer to that is, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=329.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  And the reason why I don't know is [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=332.7s)]
*  because polling is total garbage. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=334.22s)]
*  You'll have some polls that say [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  Doge is not popular at all. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=337.58s)]
*  You'll have other polls that show [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  that far more Americans favor what [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=341.14s)]
*  Doge is doing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=343.02s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=344.3s)]
*  So according to the Washington [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=345.18s)]
*  Post, almost 50% of Americans [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=347.22s)]
*  disapprove of Elon Musk's work [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  within the federal government [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=351.42s)]
*  versus 34% that approve. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=353.42s)]
*  And that's according to a Washington [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=355.58s)]
*  Post Ipsos poll. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=357.62s)]
*  But then you go to CNN where Harry [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=358.5s)]
*  Enten recently reported surprisingly [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=360.62s)]
*  good numbers for Doge. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=363.06s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=364.74s)]
*  This to me was one of the more [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=365.46000000000004s)]
*  shocking figures that I saw, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=366.98s)]
*  made me go, wait a minute, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=368.58s)]
*  hold on one second, whoa. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=369.94s)]
*  Americans on Trump and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=371.66s)]
*  Joe's efforts, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=372.98s)]
*  Doge should influence government [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=374.18s)]
*  spending and operations. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=376.06s)]
*  Look at this, 54%, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=377.82s)]
*  the majority say that he and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=379.14s)]
*  they should. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=380.97999999999996s)]
*  How about a proof of Trump trying [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=381.97999999999996s)]
*  to cut staff at government [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=383.38s)]
*  agencies? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=384.38s)]
*  Again, you get a majority here, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=384.94s)]
*  51%. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  Democrats want to argue that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=387.18s)]
*  the type of spending that Musk is [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=388.7s)]
*  cutting is mainly necessary [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=390.41999999999996s)]
*  programs, but that comes in at just [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=392.02s)]
*  36%. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=393.97999999999996s)]
*  The wasteful spending actually wins [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=394.5s)]
*  the plurality here at 42%, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  according to a recent Washington [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=397.94s)]
*  Post Ipsos poll. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=399.7s)]
*  So I don't really know what to make [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=401.06s)]
*  of these battling polls was, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=402.98s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=404.9s)]
*  And by the way, in the lead up to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=406.38s)]
*  the presidential election, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=408.46s)]
*  obviously the aggregate of polls [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=410.42s)]
*  showed that Kamala Harris was [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=412.62s)]
*  trailing Trump. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=414.62s)]
*  But even then, those polls still [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=415.86s)]
*  underestimated Trump. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=417.94s)]
*  So I don't know what to make of any [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=419.46s)]
*  of this. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=421.54s)]
*  What do you think the public [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=422.18s)]
*  perception of Doge actually is? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=424.1s)]
*  I don't think it's that weird, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=426.3s)]
*  honestly. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=428.5s)]
*  I think if you ask an American [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=429.58s)]
*  just generally, do you think [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=431.58000000000004s)]
*  there's waste in government? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=433.34000000000003s)]
*  They'll be like, yeah. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=435.26000000000005s)]
*  Do you think we should, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=437.22s)]
*  you know what I mean, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=438.5s)]
*  cut out waste? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=439.38s)]
*  They'll be like, yeah. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=440.06s)]
*  Okay, do you think we should shut [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=441.42s)]
*  down your social security office [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=443.42s)]
*  in your neighborhood? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=445.42s)]
*  Hell no, of course not. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=446.82000000000005s)]
*  That's all that's reflected to me [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=448.54s)]
*  is that there's an overwhelming [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=451.02000000000004s)]
*  support for cutting government [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  waste, so to speak. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=455.86s)]
*  But when you get into the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=457.74s)]
*  more specific, your individual [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=459.5s)]
*  Medicare, your individual Medicaid, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=461.78s)]
*  your individual Social Security, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=464.5s)]
*  the mail services that you get, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=466.97999999999996s)]
*  should the post office buy you [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=469.26s)]
*  clothes, all of these different [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=471.34s)]
*  things, I think when you get into [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=473.58s)]
*  more specific, you see way more and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=475.9s)]
*  more pushback. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=478.38s)]
*  People like their government goods [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  and services. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=481.58s)]
*  And I think what's also reflected [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=482.62s)]
*  in that polling is that the cuts [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  have not yet touched people where [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=486.7s)]
*  that's what I think is reflected [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=489.58s)]
*  there. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=491.38s)]
*  I mean, I think the second people [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=491.9s)]
*  start to feel it, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=493.98s)]
*  how people are going to feel about [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=494.98s)]
*  the tariffs and the inflation and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=497.02s)]
*  the prices and stuff. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=499.21999999999997s)]

*  people's everyday lives, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=502.58s)]
*  they will change their tune about [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=504.3s)]
*  how they feel about Elon Musk and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=506.26s)]
*  his quote unquote efficiency [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=508.1s)]
*  program. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=509.78s)]
*  I think you're right about that, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=510.9s)]
*  which is why the Washington Post [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=512.86s)]
*  just reported that they need to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=514.82s)]
*  find and champion positive [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=516.82s)]
*  achievements or the need to find and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=518.5s)]
*  champion positive achievements is [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=521.0600000000001s)]
*  seen as urgent according to two [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=523.58s)]
*  people familiar with Doge's [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=525.7800000000001s)]
*  internal workings. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=527.98s)]
*  They're actually very worried [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=529.5400000000001s)]

*  And that's good, it's good that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=536.4200000000001s)]
*  they're worried about that because [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=537.98s)]
*  that means that there is some [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=539.86s)]
*  backlash from Americans in regard [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=541.34s)]
*  to what Doge is doing. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=543.1s)]
*  But I think you're totally right [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=544.46s)]
*  about people waking up once in a [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=546.38s)]

*  might impact their day to day [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=550.34s)]
*  lives or programs that they're [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=551.9399999999999s)]

*  said programs like Social Security. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=555.9s)]
*  And so we'll see what happens but [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=558.3s)]
*  I really want to hear from people [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=561.26s)]
*  in rural West Virginia who relied [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=564.3s)]
*  on clinics in their rural part of [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=567.7s)]
*  this country that were only open [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=570.9s)]
*  because there were federal grants [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=574.1s)]
*  keeping them open. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=577.14s)]
*  Once the federal funds are frozen [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=578.74s)]
*  by the Trump administration, okay, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=580.86s)]
*  well, those clinics shuttered, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=583.38s)]
*  they closed their doors. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=585.38s)]
*  I want to know what happened to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=586.98s)]
*  those people. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=588.34s)]
*  So pitches at tytnetwork.com, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=588.9s)]
*  if you know anyone in West Virginia [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=591.02s)]

*  it's really frustrating to me [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=596.66s)]
*  because I want to hear from [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=598.34s)]
*  the actual human beings on the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=599.8199999999999s)]

*  this. But another anonymous source [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=603.14s)]
*  who is familiar with internal [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=605.26s)]
*  discussions over at Doge said this, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=606.98s)]
*  PR is viewed as a big mess [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=609.3000000000001s)]
*  internally right now. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=610.9000000000001s)]
*  So how is Doge planning on fixing [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=613.22s)]
*  that PR problem? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=615.22s)]
*  Well, for one, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=616.98s)]
*  the Washington Post is stating that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=617.98s)]
*  Elon Musk is seriously considering [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=620.22s)]
*  the Doge dividends that we've heard [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=622.4200000000001s)]
*  a little bit about. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=624.5s)]
*  We've actually reported on this a [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=625.6600000000001s)]
*  little bit. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=627.2600000000001s)]
*  But by the way, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=627.7800000000001s)]
*  let me just say this. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=628.58s)]
*  If that actually comes to fruition, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=630.22s)]
*  that is a genius plan. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=632.2600000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you're in the know and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=633.94s)]
*  following this story closely, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=635.62s)]
*  it's not going to persuade me that [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=637.5400000000001s)]
*  what Doge is up to is overall great. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=639.74s)]
*  But cold hard cash, it talks, okay? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=642.1s)]
*  The cash is talking, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=647.1s)]
*  as my dad loves to say. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=648.4200000000001s)]
*  And so it would represent a small [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=649.98s)]
*  portion of the amount of money that [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=651.9000000000001s)]
*  Doge cut from the government [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=654.0200000000001s)]
*  spending. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=655.74s)]
*  But I wouldn't want to make [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=657.0200000000001s)]
*  a deal with the devil. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=658.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to give up social [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=659.94s)]
*  security and just get a dividend, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=661.7800000000001s)]
*  like a one time small dividend [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=664.1s)]
*  that's supposed to placate me. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=666.1s)]
*  But while most Americans realize [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=668.66s)]
*  what's happening, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=670.34s)]
*  that's the question. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=671.34s)]
*  Yeah, I just honestly think that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=673.1s)]
*  the way that they've done it so [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=675.42s)]
*  far with stuff like AID and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=677.6s)]
*  pretending that every single cut is [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=679.5799999999999s)]
*  some DEI program, affirmative [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=682.18s)]
*  action, etc, etc, is fine for them [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=684.74s)]
*  for now. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=687.74s)]
*  And I think that Donald Trump does [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=688.5s)]
*  have a certain credibility, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=691.06s)]
*  specifically with his base, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=693.78s)]
*  that it's like, all right, man, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=695.58s)]
*  these things can't happen overnight. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=697.74s)]
*  But guess what, y'all, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=700.34s)]
*  what's coming down the pike is [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=701.74s)]
*  going to be a bunch of cuts. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=703.46s)]
*  They're talking about cutting [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=705.06s)]
*  Medicaid, and they're going to [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=706.8199999999999s)]
*  follow that up with an insane tax [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=708.74s)]
*  cut for the very wealthy. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=710.74s)]
*  And by the way, that's when [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=712.5s)]
*  everything sort of the tide just [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=714.5s)]
*  changed on Donald Trump. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=716.9s)]
*  It was that big tax cut and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=719.18s)]
*  then COVID-19. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=720.86s)]
*  But the second you pass these [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=722.0999999999999s)]
*  extremely ridiculous tax cut for [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=724.5s)]
*  only the richest people in America, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=727.26s)]
*  and everybody looks around, and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=730.3399999999999s)]
*  it's like my goods and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=732.9s)]
*  services have been cut. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=734.5s)]
*  While the government just [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=736.26s)]
*  essentially wrote trillions of [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=737.8599999999999s)]
*  dollars in checks for people who [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=739.8599999999999s)]
*  are already killing it in our [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=741.78s)]
*  country. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=743.5799999999999s)]
*  I think that's where Trump is going [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=744.5799999999999s)]
*  to run into major problems. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=746.3399999999999s)]
*  because I'm telling you guys, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=747.9399999999999s)]
*  if they pass anything in that damn [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=749.6199999999999s)]
*  numbers, it's going to be this tax [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=751.46s)]
*  cut and it's going to be deeply [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=753.5s)]
*  unpopular. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=755.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=756.34s)]
*  you can't escape the fact that [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=757.86s)]
*  the House's budget blueprint, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=759.9000000000001s)]
*  which they just passed, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=762.14s)]
*  we talked about it extensively. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=763.86s)]
*  Demands that the committee [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=767.1800000000001s)]
*  responsible for Medicaid cut $880 [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=769.3000000000001s)]
*  billion from the program. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=772.4000000000001s)]
*  Now some Trump supporters will [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=774.9000000000001s)]
*  immediately shoot back and say, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=776.94s)]
*  no, no, no, they want to cut [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=779.3000000000001s)]
*  the waste fraud and abuse. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=781.38s)]
*  Well, there's been analysis done [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=783.42s)]
*  on this. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=786.1s)]
*  At most, there might be $100 [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=787.06s)]
*  billion in waste fraud and abuse, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=789.26s)]
*  which by the way, yeah, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=791.98s)]
*  something should be done about [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=793.66s)]
*  that, okay? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=795.62s)]
*  I have no problem with Congress [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=796.38s)]
*  doing something about that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=797.82s)]
*  I want something done about that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=799.06s)]
*  But that doesn't, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=800.62s)]
*  $100 billion not the same as [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=801.9399999999999s)]
*  $880 billion. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=804.3s)]
*  So that argument really doesn't [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=806.5s)]
*  have any merit behind it that, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=809.9000000000001s)]
*  that's all they're focusing on. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=811.74s)]
*  That's all they're targeting when [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=813.5s)]
*  it comes to Medicaid. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=815.1s)]
*  And so we'll see what happens. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=816.1400000000001s)]
*  But one thing that I know for [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=817.4200000000001s)]
*  a fact is that most Americans [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=819.2600000000001s)]
*  aren't going to know what's going [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=821.1400000000001s)]
*  on unless the media covers it [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=823.3000000000001s)]
*  accurately, which they've done. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=825.1800000000001s)]
*  There have been some good reports [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=827.1800000000001s)]
*  on it, but not nearly enough. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJ-PCBXoUY&t=829.1s)]
