The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Congressman Accused of DOMESTIC ABUSE Gets Soft on Crime Treatment
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk)
*  I think that Americans are starting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=0.0s)]
*  to wake up to the fact that [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=1.6s)]
*  President Donald Trump is not [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=2.74s)]
*  a threat to democracy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=4.2s)]
*  He took a bullet and nearly lost his [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=5.68s)]
*  life to try and protect democracy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=7.54s)]
*  And that's what we have to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=9.88s)]
*  understand. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=10.88s)]
*  This is a man who doesn't need to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=11.4s)]
*  run, he doesn't need the job or [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=12.64s)]
*  a paycheck. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=14.0s)]
*  He's running because he loves our [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=14.84s)]
*  republic, he wants to save our [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  republic from the radical extremists [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=17.56s)]
*  who are basically making these [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=19.14s)]
*  comments that are incendiary. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, that Republican lawmaker, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=23.64s)]
*  Representative Cory Mills, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=25.84s)]
*  is now facing a pretty serious [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=27.72s)]
*  investigation having to do with [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=29.52s)]
*  allegations that he physically [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=31.48s)]
*  assaulted his mistress. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Now the story is super complicated [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=36.2s)]
*  and there's lots of twists and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=38.0s)]
*  turns because while police could [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  have arrested him on the spot, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=41.24s)]
*  they decided against doing so. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=43.0s)]
*  And there are three different [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=44.92s)]
*  police reports involved in this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=46.84s)]
*  story, so bear with me as I go [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=48.96s)]
*  through the details. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=50.88s)]
*  So in a statement, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=52.28s)]
*  the Metropolitan Police Department [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  in DC of course, said officers were [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=56.68s)]
*  called to the 1300th block of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=59.36s)]
*  Maryland Avenue Southwest around [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=61.56s)]
*  1.15 PM Wednesday for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=64.0s)]
*  the report of an assault, adding [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=65.6s)]
*  that an active criminal [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=68.0s)]
*  investigation is underway. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=69.66s)]
*  So apparently, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=72.8s)]
*  Congressman Mills had some sort of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=73.84s)]
*  physical altercation with his [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=76.04s)]
*  mistress, that's the allegation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=78.08s)]
*  here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=80.4s)]
*  The police were called to the scene. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=81.68s)]
*  Now there are three police reports [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=83.76s)]
*  with varying levels of detail about [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=85.72s)]
*  what went down between Mills and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=87.92s)]
*  his alleged victim, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=89.92s)]
*  a 27 year old woman. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  By the way, he's married with two [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=93.16s)]
*  children, but I'll continue. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=94.76s)]
*  So the first police report provided [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=96.56s)]
*  to News 4, that's an NBC affiliate, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=99.12s)]
*  said her significant other for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=102.04s)]
*  over a year, that's Mills, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=104.68s)]
*  grabbed her, shoved her, and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  pushed her out of the door. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=109.2s)]
*  The report says she showed [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=111.28s)]
*  the officer bruises on her arm, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=112.92s)]
*  which appeared fresh. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  Now, the first report then goes on [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=117.28s)]
*  to note that during a phone call [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  between the significant other and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=121.92s)]
*  alleged victim, she let officers [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=124.24s)]
*  hear subject one, and now [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=126.69999999999999s)]
*  identified by the Metropolitan [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  Police Department as Congressman [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=130.88s)]
*  Mills, instruct her to lie about [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  the origin of her bruises. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=135.72s)]
*  Not good, very bad. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=138.72s)]
*  So guys, the most important part of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=140.64s)]
*  this story is why they didn't [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  pursue charges in the first place. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Which is devastating, but [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=145.92s)]
*  look at how clear it is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=147.88s)]
*  The cops heard him telling her to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  lie about the bruises. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  Eventually subject one made contact [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  with police and admitted that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  the situation escalated from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=157.04s)]
*  verbal to physical, but [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=158.64s)]
*  it was severe enough to create [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=160.16s)]
*  bruising. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  So that's the congressman, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  he even admits that it was [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  physical at the time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=166.76s)]
*  Okay, so why wasn't he arrested for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  carrying out physical violence [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=170.72s)]
*  against a 27 year old woman? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay, so when the police arrived to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=175.12s)]
*  the scene, they told the woman who [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=177.68s)]
*  was physically shaking and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  scared that Mills would be placed [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=182.02s)]
*  under arrest. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  But then she recanted the details [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=185.84s)]
*  and the origin of the bruises, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=188.02s)]
*  okay? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=190.06s)]
*  So they didn't arrest him there, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=191.44s)]
*  but they could have, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=193.0s)]
*  They don't need her cooperation to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  arrest him at that point, but [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=196.12s)]
*  they didn't. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  Now in a text message to NBC [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=198.56s)]
*  Washington's I team for NBC News, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=200.52s)]
*  she stated yesterday I contacted [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=203.84s)]
*  law enforcement to address [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=205.6s)]
*  a personal matter. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=206.96s)]
*  Although the argument was [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=208.12s)]
*  emotionally charged, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=209.32s)]
*  there was no physical abuse [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=210.44s)]
*  involved. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=211.72s)]
*  So then later we get more police [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=212.24s)]
*  reports, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=214.68s)]
*  So when News 4, again, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=216.68s)]
*  local NBC affiliate reached out to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=218.1s)]
*  DC police for comment, they [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  provided a third version of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=221.68s)]
*  the report Thursday night, which [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=223.28s)]
*  had changed once again saying [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=225.16s)]
*  officers responded for [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=226.84s)]
*  a report of an assault and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=228.2s)]
*  that the assault is being [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=229.76s)]
*  investigated. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=231.2s)]
*  The second version of the police [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=232.64s)]
*  report obtained by NBC News a day [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=234.44s)]
*  after the alleged incident occurred [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=236.44s)]
*  says only that officers responded [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  for a family disturbance and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  there was no probable cause for [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=242.54s)]
*  an arrest. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  So now there's apparently [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=245.72s)]
*  an internal investigation that has [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  been launched to figure out why no [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=249.48s)]
*  arrest was made initially when [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  there could have been an arrest. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=253.48s)]
*  According to DC law, officers are [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  allowed to arrest someone if [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  there's probable cause, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=259.44s)]
*  that they committed an intrafamily [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=261.14s)]
*  offense resulting in physical [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  injury or pain. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=265.06s)]
*  Additionally, they are required to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=266.74s)]
*  investigate allegations of domestic [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=268.58s)]
*  violence with or [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=270.36s)]
*  without cooperation from the victim. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=271.18s)]
*  Now, on Monday, the DC Metropolitan [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=273.66s)]
*  Police Department told NBC News [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=276.26s)]
*  that a warrant for his arrest was [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=278.54s)]
*  sent to the US Attorney's office on [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=280.74s)]
*  Friday. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=283.06s)]
*  According to the NBC News report, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=283.98s)]
*  the warrant has not been signed and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=286.62s)]
*  his case has been sent back to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=290.26s)]
*  the Metropolitan Police Department [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=292.42s)]
*  for further investigation, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=295.42s)]
*  cops said. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=297.5s)]
*  And we want to know why apparently [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=298.3s)]
*  the US Attorney's office didn't [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=300.1s)]
*  offer a comment since it's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=301.82s)]
*  an uncharged case. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=303.5s)]
*  But apparently Ed Martin, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=304.74s)]
*  a Trump appointee who was named [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=306.78s)]
*  interim US Attorney for [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=309.08s)]
*  the District of Columbia when Trump [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=310.78s)]
*  took office, is not, I guess not in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=313.32s)]
*  favor of going after Mills, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=316.02s)]
*  is that what's going on here? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, he has said in the past that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=319.86s)]
*  the US Attorney should be like [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  Trump's personal attorneys. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=325.26s)]
*  So this guy is a Republican [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=328.98s)]
*  politician that supported [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=331.5s)]
*  So this Ed Martin, who is [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=332.38s)]
*  avowedly political, and is saying, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=334.02000000000004s)]
*  no, I don't want him arrested. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  So now here's where we are. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=338.82s)]
*  I told you we warned you about [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=340.74s)]
*  the lawlessness. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=342.06s)]
*  And now they're saying, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=343.42s)]
*  you want to beat up your 27 year [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=344.54s)]
*  old girlfriend while you've got [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=345.94s)]
*  a family back at home, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=347.38s)]
*  party of family values? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=348.5s)]
*  Don't worry, we got US Attorney's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  office that say, we'll do [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=351.86s)]
*  investigations of people like James [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=353.1s)]
*  Comey based on nonsense conspiracy [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=354.86s)]
*  theories. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=356.78s)]
*  But you, who actually did domestic [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  assault, you're free to go. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=359.7s)]
*  Because Republicans are above [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=362.1s)]
*  the law now, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=363.38s)]
*  Republican politicians are. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=363.98s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=365.38s)]
*  So we'll see, but they have him on [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=365.88s)]
*  tape, the cops heard him saying it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=368.62s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be much [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=372.21999999999997s)]
*  question about it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  He's of course furiously denying [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=374.06s)]
*  because he's like, we've rigged [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=375.94s)]
*  the whole system, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=377.7s)]
*  we can do whatever we want. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=378.66s)]
*  Including apparently beating up [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  your mistress. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  So Republicans, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=383.5s)]
*  you must be so proud. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=384.62s)]
*  Well, I heard about lawfare, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=387.06s)]
*  I guess this is the opposite [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=388.66s)]
*  of lawfare, where you get to be [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=390.1s)]
*  above the law. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=391.66s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=392.58000000000004s)]
*  an angel gets his swings. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=394.18s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOny0q8nBk&t=395.66s)]
