"Rep. Lauren Boebert piled onto a bogus claim spreading through the MAGA universe that the government has been heavily subsidizing Politico, only to be revealed to have a subscription to the media organization.

The Colorado congresswoman hit out at the media outlet as President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and other MAGA personalities boosted the misleading claim that Politico was funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)."

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump Admin LOSES IT Over Fake Story
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4)
*  I was made aware of the funding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=0.0s)]
*  from USAID to media outlets, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=2.48s)]
*  including Politico, who I know has [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=4.8s)]
*  a seat in this room. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=7.72s)]
*  And I can confirm that the more [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=9.48s)]
*  than 8 million taxpayer dollars [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=11.28s)]
*  that have gone to essentially [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=13.22s)]
*  subsidizing subscriptions to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=14.84s)]
*  Politico on the American taxpayers [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=16.54s)]
*  dime will no longer be happening. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=18.42s)]
*  The Doge team is working on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=20.14s)]
*  canceling those payments now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=21.36s)]
*  The Doge team is run by Elon Musk [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=23.44s)]
*  who has been subsidized by so [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  many taxpayer dollars. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  He gets to make rockets that get [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=29.0s)]
*  caught by chopsticks. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=31.28s)]
*  You don't see it? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=33.88s)]
*  Another great thing is this lady [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=34.92s)]
*  over my shoulder, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=36.68s)]
*  someone pointed out the where she [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=37.78s)]
*  stands, we usually over to the side [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  of her just says the whitewashing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=41.88s)]
*  It's pretty great. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=45.04s)]
*  But anyways, so the right wing is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=46.72s)]
*  developed in even more unfounded [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=48.56s)]
*  seemingly unfounded claims to latch [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=50.32s)]
*  on to and run with when it comes to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=52.28s)]
*  government waste. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=54.0s)]
*  This time they're centering around [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=55.8s)]
*  Politico. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=57.6s)]
*  But yet again, it seems like they [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=58.32s)]
*  didn't get their facts right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=59.84s)]
*  According to News Nation reports, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=61.28s)]
*  the false claims appear to stem [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=63.6s)]
*  from a post by conservative [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=65.56s)]
*  commentator, whoever this guy is, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=67.36s)]
*  connected a semaphore story that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=69.8s)]
*  showed Politico staffers hadn't [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=72.0s)]
*  been paid over a technical error. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=74.28s)]
*  That was subsequently fixed to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  a usaspending.gov page that shows [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  Politico received $8.2 million. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=81.64s)]
*  Here is the post. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=85.28s)]
*  8.1 million or whatever. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=88.04s)]
*  But of course, right wingers took [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  the claim at face value and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=91.72s)]
*  ran with it eventually having it [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=93.28s)]
*  land on Trump's radar. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=95.4s)]
*  Here's Trump's tweet. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=97.88s)]
*  It looks like billions of dollars [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=99.44s)]
*  have been stolen. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=102.36s)]
*  My God. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=104.72s)]
*  I saw someone's like there's across [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=106.44s)]
*  the world everyone sees that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=108.04s)]
*  the president can't write [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=109.36s)]
*  Stalin correctly, stolen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=110.48s)]
*  He spelled it wrong in front of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=111.92s)]
*  everyone. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=113.12s)]
*  They're like, I can't believe I'm [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=113.62s)]
*  losing to this guy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=115.12s)]
*  At USAID and other agencies, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=115.76s)]

*  the federal government. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=504.4s)]
*  While this a-hole, Elon Musk, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  spent hundreds of millions of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=507.52s)]
*  dollars to get this guy into [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=509.2s)]

*  has made billions since. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  Can we put that in numbers? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=513.6s)]
*  Can we put like $400 billion in [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=515.6s)]
*  numbers with all zeros so [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=517.4s)]
*  we can talk about how much this guy [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  has made off of his purchase [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=520.88s)]

*  It's all a game. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  It's all an illusion. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=525.52s)]
*  It's all just a showboat to make. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=527.0s)]
*  Why is it? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=530.76s)]
*  I was going to call these folks a [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=531.4s)]
*  bunch of names, but [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=533.0s)]
*  I'm trying to stop doing that. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=534.04s)]
*  Not because this is going to change [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=536.36s)]
*  anyone's minds, but just I feel [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=537.84s)]
*  like it lowers the conversation [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=539.24s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=540.64s)]
*  So these folks who don't think that [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=541.36s)]
*  clearly will see a large number and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=543.08s)]
*  think like 8.2 million dollars is [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=544.84s)]
*  a total waste of money. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=546.64s)]
*  Where's that going to go? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=548.12s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=549.5600000000001s)]
*  And if he saves that 8.2 million [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=550.64s)]
*  dollars that you think is going to [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=552.16s)]
*  fraud, waste, and abuse, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=553.52s)]
*  where's the document that's showing [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=554.72s)]
*  that it's going into your pocket? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=556.68s)]
*  After he cuts these hundreds of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=559.4s)]
*  billions of dollars from the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=561.16s)]
*  federal budget that's so fat, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=562.64s)]
*  how do you know where it's going? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=564.36s)]
*  Do you know where it's going? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=567.6s)]
*  Is it going to your paycheck? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=568.64s)]
*  Is it going to your empty ass bank [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=569.64s)]
*  account? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=571.16s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=572.16s)]
*  Yeah, I had covered this story for [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=573.8s)]
*  Rebel HQ and my main grievance with [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=575.24s)]
*  the story was JR's grievance. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=576.92s)]
*  It was how quickly something, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=578.64s)]
*  whether it's true or false, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=580.24s)]
*  can spread on social media. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=581.68s)]
*  So if what Kyle Becker had said in [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=583.28s)]
*  the first place was actually true, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=585.12s)]
*  then it would have been lucky. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  As far as we know now, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  it wasn't true, but [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=590.04s)]
*  it doesn't matter because once a [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=591.0799999999999s)]
*  thing has been said becomes part of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=592.8s)]
*  the zeitgeist. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=594.56s)]
*  It's already been planted in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=595.28s)]
*  people's minds. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=596.52s)]
*  So many people now believe this is [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  true with such certainty that [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=599.28s)]
*  nothing anyone says can sway them [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=600.8s)]
*  away from this belief. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=602.56s)]
*  Kind of strange how tightly they [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=604.28s)]
*  can hold on to a belief that they [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=606.24s)]
*  didn't even have a day or two ago, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  but now they're so married to it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=610.4s)]
*  And the big issue that people have [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  with this quote unquote revelation, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=614.0s)]
*  which turned out to just be [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=615.88s)]
*  business as usual and [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=617.18s)]
*  nothing newsworthy at all, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=618.26s)]
*  is that the government is giving [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=619.68s)]
*  money in one way or [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=621.36s)]
*  another to these news outlets that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=622.26s)]
*  they don't like or support. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=624.0s)]
*  It feels conspiratorial because [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=625.52s)]
*  suddenly they have an explanation [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=627.36s)]
*  as to why certain media outlets [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  like Politico, like the associated [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=631.16s)]
*  press, don't seem to like Trump. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  The actual reason is too simple and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=635.8s)]
*  too insulting to their own [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=637.68s)]
*  intelligence and to their beliefs [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=639.12s)]
*  for them to accept. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=640.92s)]
*  Ergo, it all has to be some kind of [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=642.04s)]
*  grand conspiracy from [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=643.84s)]
*  the government. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=645.12s)]
*  And then Trump calling this the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  biggest scandal of them all. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=648.48s)]
*  And Elon saying this is a huge [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=650.16s)]
*  waste of taxpayer money, obviously. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=652.0s)]
*  It's like they were just grateful [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=655.0s)]
*  that the internet came up with this [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=656.8s)]
*  on its own to distract itself with. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=658.7s)]
*  So they were just like, yeah, sure, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=660.52s)]
*  so crazy, $8 million. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=662.52s)]
*  $8 million is negligible to people [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=663.88s)]
*  like Donald Trump and Elon Musk, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=665.84s)]
*  because as JR pointed out, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=667.8399999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk, his personal wealth has [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=669.64s)]
*  grown by billions of dollars since [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=672.12s)]
*  Trump was elected as president. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=674.68s)]
*  So $8 million is nothing. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=677.3599999999999s)]
*  And Elon Musk knows that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=679.4s)]
*  He also knows that it doesn't mean [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=680.5999999999999s)]
*  anything in the grand scheme of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=682.04s)]
*  what he's trying to do in [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=683.3599999999999s)]
*  our government. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=684.3599999999999s)]
*  But as long as people are losing [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  their minds over this $8 million, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=686.7199999999999s)]
*  then as long as they're blaming [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=688.5999999999999s)]
*  the expenditure on the Democrats, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=690.16s)]
*  even though both Republican and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  Democratic administrations were [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=693.76s)]
*  subscribing to these same outlets, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=695.5999999999999s)]
*  then people aren't so worried about [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=697.6s)]
*  what Elon and Trump are actually [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=699.36s)]
*  doing. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=701.0s)]
*  What they're actually doing is [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=701.5s)]
*  trying to wipe out trillions of [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=703.1s)]
*  dollars in government spending. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  Trillions is such a big number that [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=706.4s)]
*  most people can't even comprehend [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=708.12s)]
*  what that means. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=710.0s)]
*  $8 million compared to trillions, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=710.9200000000001s)]
*  again, is nothing. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=712.88s)]
*  They are gutting your healthcare. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=714.12s)]
*  They are dismantling [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=715.84s)]
*  the Department of Education. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=716.9200000000001s)]
*  They're not holding the Pentagon [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=718.72s)]
*  accountable for [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=720.32s)]
*  not passing any of its audits. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=721.16s)]
*  But sure, yeah, let's talk about [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=722.8000000000001s)]
*  this $8 million to Politico instead. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=724.6s)]
*  Well, that's specifically [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=727.04s)]
*  the difference, right? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=728.1999999999999s)]
*  Because my argument would be that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  they're not trying to cut any money [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=731.0s)]
*  from the government. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=732.8399999999999s)]
*  I know the way in which you're [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=734.16s)]

*  Their goal is to turn what the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=741.36s)]

*  period. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=758.68s)]
*  And the Pentagon, while being [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=760.28s)]

*  So that is already a check mark. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  Being in the public sector, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=770.16s)]
*  check market doesn't matter. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=771.36s)]

*  That's so useful for them. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=786.48s)]
*  But they also want to privatize [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=788.2s)]
*  the education system. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=789.52s)]

*  So when they go out and [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=799.2s)]
*  in the meantime, they're going [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=800.44s)]
*  after Politico because they have [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=802.4s)]

*  When you say Politico is bad, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=813.6999999999999s)]
*  you're making a gross [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=815.54s)]
*  generalization, right? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=816.86s)]

*  Their reporting frequently sucks. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=830.8199999999999s)]
*  It's access journalism, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=835.8199999999999s)]
*  all that stuff. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=837.38s)]

*  Politico's reporting quite [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gPj8vEOR4&t=843.0600000000001s)]
