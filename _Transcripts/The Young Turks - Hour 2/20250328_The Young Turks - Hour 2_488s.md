"A federal worker accidentally includes a journalist on a detailed message in advance of a government operation. 

While that sounds like the case of The Atlantic‚Äôs editor-in-chief being added to a group Signal chat by Trump‚Äôs national security adviser Michael Waltz, in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed military attack plans in Yemen, it‚Äôs not. "*

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Never Forget Trump's Goons Said This
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY)
*  There's hypocrisy that we knew was there and then there's like a whole new level where people just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=0.0s)]
*  enjoy coming before the cameras and saying utter nonsense as if they didn't do something different [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=5.44s)]
*  and say something different yesterday. It's bizarre, but it is our normal, like you said. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=10.32s)]
*  It has though brought to light that serious hypocrisy in the Trump administration. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=16.16s)]
*  So listen to this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=20.88s)]
*  Any security professional, military, government or otherwise, would be fired on the spot for this [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=22.32s)]
*  type of conduct and criminally prosecuted for being so reckless with this kind of information. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=29.12s)]
*  The assumption is in the intelligence community, if you are using unclassified means, there is [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=34.24s)]
*  the potential for and likelihood that foreign governments are targeting those accounts and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=38.8s)]
*  gathering intelligence from them. How damaging is it to your ability to recruit or build allies [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  with others when they're worried that our leaders may be exposing them because of their gross [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=48.08s)]
*  negligence or their recklessness in handling information? She was less than truthful about [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=52.88s)]
*  repeatedly. And it goes to the issue of both confidence and credibility. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=57.36s)]
*  It is irresponsible for an elected official and her capacity to be discussing highly sensitive [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=60.88s)]
*  things on a format that she had to have known was not fully secure. A sitting national security [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=65.92s)]
*  advisor right now, Jake Sullivan, was sending and laundering classified documents into an [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=71.28s)]
*  unclassified server. But the bar is so low for elected officials today when it comes to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  transparency and just telling partial truths, just tell us a little bit more truth. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=84.8s)]
*  But this is stunning. And to me, it's almost worse that they're sitting here and lying [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  to our faces given those comments that we just played from several years ago that could, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=96.32s)]
*  you wouldn't need to change a word, okay? Just insert different players. There you have it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=100.64s)]
*  It does seem unlikely that there will be consequences for anyone who's involved in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=105.84s)]
*  this scandal, maybe Jeffrey Goldberg. Maybe someone will figure out how to punish the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=110.56s)]
*  reporter. They're probably working on that right now. But according to the anonymous [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=114.88s)]
*  US defense official involved here about the signal group chat blunder, who's familiar with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=118.8s)]
*  the operation in Yemen. These are operational plans that are highly classified in order to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  protect the service members. It is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=131.84s)]
*  marshaled for this. We don't provide the level of information on unclassified systems in order to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=136.48s)]
*  protect the lives and safety of the service members carrying out these strikes. If we did, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=142.88s)]
*  it would be wholly irresponsible. My most junior analysts know not to do this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=148.56s)]
*  It's elementary. Former representative Adam Kinzinger put it more succinctly, you can see it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  here. Any member of the military who did what they did on signal would be kicked out or arrested. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=160.96s)]
*  And we're kind of seeing what would happen if a lower level staffer did something similar because [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=169.36s)]
*  NBC News reported this yesterday. Ironic timing, isn't it? DHS staffer faces serious punishment [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=174.56s)]
*  for accidentally adding a reporter to a group email. Not talking about the chat here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  According to the report, long time Department of Homeland Security employee who told colleagues [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  she inadvertently sent unclassified details of an upcoming immigration and customs enforcement [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=196.72s)]
*  operation to a journalist in late January, ordering to former ICE Chief of Staff Jason [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=201.84s)]
*  Hauser, one former DHS official and one current DHS official. It's important to note that while [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=208.4s)]
*  these were unclassified details, they were law enforcement sensitive because it included [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=215.28s)]
*  when the operation was happening. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=222.56s)]
*  Possible locations of the target. And guess what? Even these situations are extremely similar. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=226.24s)]
*  That staffer was put on administrative leave and is planning to have her security clearances revoked. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=233.36s)]
*  What a surprise. So how can anyone, there was already limited respect for then nominees, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=240.08s)]
*  now confirm members of the President's Cabinet. But how can anyone follow them, take them [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=247.84s)]
*  seriously, take advice from them, let alone about military operations if this is how they behave? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  And yeah, the hypocrisy. They don't face any consequences, won't even really apologize. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=259.2s)]
*  But the men and women under them for doing far less, far less, are about to lose it all. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  But I hear Mike Walls, Pete Hegseth, their security clearance is about to be revoked and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=270.4s)]
*  placed on administrative. No, right, there'll be no consequences whatsoever. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=275.44s)]
*  So we're asking you in the live chat, if Hegseth and Walls weren't part of the elites, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=280.32s)]
*  would they have been fired for this? So watch show Monday through Friday, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=284.96s)]
*  six o'clock is when we start every day and they'd be part of the show. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Of course, everybody knows, 90%. Of course, that if you were not at the very top, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=293.76s)]
*  you'd be fired for this. This is not close. She's gonna probably get fired for the unclassified [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=298.64s)]
*  information about ICE. They put classified information about a top secret military strike [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=303.68s)]
*  that could have gotten the pilots killed. It doesn't get any worse than that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=309.28s)]
*  So but again, it's gratifying to see that the 60% of Republicans think it's a big deal too. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=312.64s)]
*  I'm gonna give my last words to two members here from tyt.com. By the way, annual membership gives [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=317.76s)]
*  you two months off there. Jack Callahan wrote in, how come nobody's talking about the real issue? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=323.44s)]
*  We bombed civilian targets and apartment buildings in Yemen, please. Yes, by the way, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=328.16s)]
*  loss in all this is two things. 53 people killed in that strike. Were they all terrorists? Of course [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=332.64s)]
*  not. But the civilians killed, just no one cares. Another member wrote in on another platform saying, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=338.4s)]
*  also, nobody's talking about in the middle of the chat except us, because I mentioned [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=348.24s)]
*  this a couple of times in previous shows. In the middle of the chat, they're like, well, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=352.96s)]
*  either we're gonna do it or Israel's gonna do it and then charge us for it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=356.88s)]
*  So we might as well do it for them. Okay, it's amazing. It's amazing. Finally, last word is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=359.76s)]
*  G-Rod saying, after all that talk about DEI this and unqualified that, but when these people make [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=366.4s)]
*  one inexcusable error after another, they're not responsible. It's everybody else's fault. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=372.24s)]
*  Hilariously pathetic. Yeah, I mean, for me, a lot of this goes to the question of power and leverage, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=379.04s)]
*  right? So the Houthis are one of the only governments in the planet that are attempting [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=386.0s)]
*  to try to show some form of power. I don't know if the word is leverage, to try to stop what has been [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=394.24s)]
*  normalized now in this country and around the world, which is the extermination of a group of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=401.44s)]
*  people that is occurring in front of our eyes. And we have to sit with that and honestly look [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=409.52s)]
*  at that. So we have to recognize the forest from the trees here, right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=415.6s)]
*  The big, big issue that most Arab governments are not trying to exert any leverage or power from what [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=420.88s)]
*  we can see to try to stop this. It's really only the Houthis, right? And the Houthis are, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=427.04s)]
*  I'm not trying to praise them in some naive sense, but I think we need to understand that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=433.36s)]
*  Similarly, let's look at power and leverage around this issue. We used to live in a time where there [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  was sufficient power and leverage that existed, where if someone did their emails on a private [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  server, that seemed to have been sufficient to be one of the big means by which that person would be [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  seen as not trustworthy, corrupt, and not electable. I know there are many things we [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=453.52s)]
*  genuinely didn't like about Hillary Clinton, but I think we can mention that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=459.68s)]
*  Now, where is the power and leverage to try to stop any of these people from doing anything they [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=464.56s)]
*  want outside of quick little embarrassments or just deflecting it onto someone else? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=470.56s)]
*  So this to me is really what we're staring at right now here in the United States and around the world. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=476.64s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=481.76s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqRgh3LtzY&t=484.88s)]
