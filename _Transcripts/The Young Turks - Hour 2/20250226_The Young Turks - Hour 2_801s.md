"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Bezos Makes ABSURD Demands of WaPo Editorial Board
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ)
*  Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=0.0s)]
*  of Amazon and unfortunately also [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=2.58s)]
*  the owner of the Washington Post is [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=4.88s)]
*  putting his thumb on the free [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=7.34s)]
*  presses scale with a shocking new [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=9.46s)]
*  mandate for editorial writers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=11.96s)]
*  The people who do opinion, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=14.88s)]
*  op-eds, things like that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=16.66s)]
*  He's demanding that they [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=18.66s)]
*  essentially propagate his favorable [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=20.54s)]
*  views on free market capitalism or [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=23.48s)]
*  leave. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  So how exactly does it make sense [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=27.76s)]
*  to have editorials when the writers [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=30.360000000000003s)]
*  aren't really able to share their [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=32.94s)]
*  opinion when they're just [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=35.18s)]
*  propagating Jeff Bezos' propaganda? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=37.18s)]
*  Okay, so he says this in a note [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=40.32s)]
*  that he sent to Washington Post's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=42.36s)]
*  team this morning on X. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=44.72s)]
*  So he writes, I'm writing to let [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=47.56s)]
*  you know about a change coming to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=49.32s)]
*  our opinion pages. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  We are going to be writing every [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=52.38s)]
*  day in support and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  defense of two pillars, personal [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=55.44s)]
*  liberties and free markets. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=57.68s)]
*  We'll cover other topics too, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=59.64s)]
*  of course, but [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=61.64s)]
*  viewpoints opposing those pillars [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=62.72s)]
*  will be left to be published by [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=65.0s)]
*  others. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=66.8s)]
*  So in other words, we're going to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=67.36s)]
*  publish editorials that benefit me [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  and my worldview and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=72.32s)]
*  help me maximize my profits, okay. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=73.88s)]
*  And he also writes, I'm confident [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=77.24s)]
*  that free markets and personal [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=79.32s)]
*  liberties are right for America. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=81.12s)]
*  I also believe these viewpoints [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=83.24s)]
*  are underserved in the current [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  market of ideas and news opinion. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  And then he informs about how he [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=90.0s)]
*  pushed someone out because they [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=92.44s)]
*  were unwilling to play ball with [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=94.82s)]
*  this new ridiculous directive. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=97.24s)]
*  I offer David Shipley, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  whom I greatly admire, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=102.36s)]
*  the opportunity to lead this new [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=104.0s)]
*  chapter. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=106.32s)]
*  I suggested to him that if the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  answer wasn't hell yes, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=109.32s)]
*  then it had to be no. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  After careful consideration, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  he decided to step away. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=113.76s)]
*  This is a significant shift. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=115.36s)]
*  It won't be easy and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=117.0s)]
*  it will require 100% commitment. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  I respect his decision. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=120.68s)]
*  We'll be searching for [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=122.2s)]
*  a new opinion editor to be my [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  little bitch, that was my addition [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=124.92s)]
*  to his statement, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  to own this new direction, okay. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=128.36s)]
*  So basically what Jeff Bezos [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  communicated to the American people [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=133.08s)]
*  is that the editorial portion of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  the Washington Post is now useless [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=138.4s)]
*  and not worth reading at all. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=140.96s)]
*  That's it, that's literally what he [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  did by putting out the statement. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the statement was amazing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  I love so many parts of it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=148.92s)]
*  The free market thing, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=150.0s)]
*  it's underserved. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=151.6s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I watch CNN, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=153.92s)]
*  MSNBC, Fox News, all just like UBI [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  and WealthTech, it's just endless [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=158.48s)]
*  calls for regulation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=160.88s)]
*  It's so ridiculous. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  And then it'll take 100% [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=163.48s)]
*  commitment. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=165.64s)]
*  It'll be hard to not allow [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  dissenting opinions to be, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=168.72s)]
*  how hard is that? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=170.84s)]
*  They email you with a pitch and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  you delete it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=173.48s)]
*  That doesn't set censorship doesn't [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=174.32s)]
*  seem that difficult in this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  particular context. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=177.6s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=178.76s)]
*  I mean, yeah, this is, I mean, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=179.88s)]
*  didn't conservative voters feel [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=182.56s)]
*  a lot of rage over censorship? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=185.48s)]
*  I mean, what happened? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  I've been trying for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  a very long time to get people to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=191.04s)]
*  understand that when the left and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=192.28s)]
*  the right use the term free speech, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=193.56s)]
*  they mean very different things. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=195.0s)]
*  And I think this is a demonstration [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  of it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=198.0s)]
*  They're not going to have [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=198.16s)]
*  a single problem with that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  As you're going to demonstrate, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  they love it because it is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=200.72s)]
*  consistent with what they mean when [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=202.12s)]
*  they talk about free speech and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=203.88000000000002s)]
*  censorship and stuff like that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  Which has no relationship to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=206.96s)]
*  either the way we think about it or [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  I would argue the way the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  Constitution and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  the founders thought about it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=211.4s)]
*  But I would also quickly say before [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  you move on to those reactions. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=214.28s)]
*  I think the most obvious part of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=215.8s)]
*  this that's terrible is that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  they're going to be censoring [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=217.88000000000002s)]

*  They desperately want censorship. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=734.28s)]
*  The last thing in the world they [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=736.4799999999999s)]
*  want is an actual free market of [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=738.16s)]
*  ideas because they know that they [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=739.76s)]
*  can't actually win on their real [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=741.56s)]
*  agenda. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=743.28s)]
*  That's why they distract and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  obfuscate with all the culture war [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=745.28s)]
*  and the constant identity politics [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  and all that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=748.7199999999999s)]
*  And this is just another step [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=749.56s)]
*  towards that in the same way that [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=750.76s)]
*  they loved it when Elon Musk was [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=752.2s)]
*  banning independent journalists and [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=753.96s)]
*  activists and taking down links [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=755.9200000000001s)]
*  that he didn't like and [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=757.72s)]
*  banning posting to platforms that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=759.0s)]
*  he can't control. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=760.96s)]
*  They desperately crave censorship [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=762.24s)]
*  for the same reason they crave [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=764.08s)]
*  strong men. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=765.6400000000001s)]
*  It protects them from a world that [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=766.6s)]
*  terrifies them. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=768.0s)]
*  Well, I'm going to say this. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=769.0s)]
*  We've seen how censorship worked [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  out for the left when they engaged [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=773.24s)]
*  in it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=775.2800000000001s)]
*  And what it led to was more [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=776.44s)]
*  attention being paid toward [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=778.0400000000001s)]
*  the ideas that the left was trying [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=779.88s)]
*  to censor. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=781.84s)]
*  So go for it, Jeff Bezos, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=782.96s)]
*  see how it works out for you. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=784.44s)]
*  But I suspect that the American [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=786.1600000000001s)]
*  people are going to find out about [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=788.24s)]
*  the robbery one way or [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=790.44s)]
*  the other and we'll make sure that. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmFH5bZ8QQ&t=791.96s)]
