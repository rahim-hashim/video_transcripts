The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Judge Hands Elon & Trump A Win for DOGE
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg)
*  14 separate states decided to pursue a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the actions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=0.0s)]
*  that are being taken by Doge in essentially firing federal workers, cutting certain federal [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=8.0s)]
*  programs, freezing federal grants. There's a lot of judicial activity happening here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=14.8s)]
*  But let's talk a little bit about how this lawsuit that was filed by 14 states has played out so far. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=21.6s)]
*  Now for the first three weeks of Trump's administration, judges have put a damper [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=28.72s)]
*  on his efforts to consolidate power in the executive branch. In fact, many of his executive [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=33.04s)]
*  orders freezing funding were temporarily blocked. But yesterday, Trump and Doge were handed a pretty [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=38.4s)]
*  significant win when a federal judge in Washington declined to bar Elon Musk and his team from [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=45.92s)]
*  ordering the mass firings of federal workers, of course, or having access to sensitive data, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=53.28s)]
*  private personal information at seven separate federal agencies. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=60.72s)]
*  So 14 state attorneys general had sought a temporary restraining order to prevent Elon [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=65.2s)]
*  Musk or anyone on his efficiency team from combing through data at seven agencies. And that includes [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=71.12s)]
*  Office of Personnel Management and the Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, Energy, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=79.04s)]
*  Transportation and Commerce Departments, okay? So it also sought to prevent Elon Musk's operatives [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=85.76s)]
*  from terminating, furloughing or otherwise placing on involuntary leave any employees who work at [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  those agencies. Now Judge Tanya Chutkin wrote that states really couldn't provide specific examples [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=100.56s)]
*  of how Doge's efforts would cause imminent or irreparable harm to the states or their residents. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  But she suggested that the lawsuit still had a strong chance of succeeding in later litigation [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  when additional evidence becomes available. So here's what the judge writes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=123.92s)]
*  Plaintiffs legitimately call into question what appears to be the unchecked authority of an [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=128.0s)]
*  unelected individual and an entity that was not created by Congress and over which it has [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=134.24s)]
*  no oversight. So she's saying, look, this is a legitimate concern. It's just that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  in order to succeed in this litigation, in this lawsuit, you have to provide specific examples. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=148.56s)]
*  And those examples are not available yet because these actions by the Trump administration are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  still relatively new. And speaking of having no oversight, the White House is still having [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=160.4s)]
*  trouble naming who exactly the leader of Doge is after a Trump official said in a legal filing [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=165.12s)]
*  just yesterday that Elon Musk had no authority to make decisions. Take a look. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=172.8s)]
*  In a court filing, the White House said that Elon Musk is not a Doge employee and has no authority [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  to make decisions. Can you clarify for us today? That role is there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=185.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Elon is to me a patriot. So you could call him an employee, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=190.4s)]
*  you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=195.84s)]
*  Who is the administrator and is must directly consulted with that person? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=198.32s)]
*  Again, I just answered this question about Elon Musk. He is a special government employee within [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  the executive office of the president. And the agencies are directing the cuts and the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=206.56s)]
*  cuts of the wasteful spending. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=212.96s)]
*  Who is in charge of Doge? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=214.24s)]
*  The president of the United States. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=217.76s)]
*  He's the administrator of Doge? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=220.16s)]
*  No, the Doge is what was formerly US Digital Services. It's an agency, the federal government [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=223.44s)]
*  that reports into the office of the executive office of the president, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=231.04s)]
*  which reports to the president of the United States. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=235.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=237.12s)]
*  The way that Article 2 works is a president wins an election and then he appoints staff, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=238.08s)]
*  including myself, including Mike Waltz, including Susie Wiles, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=243.28s)]
*  including Elon Musk and those staff report to him. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=247.52s)]
*  Okay, well aware. Does Elon Musk know he's not in charge of Doge? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=250.16s)]
*  Again, the president runs the government, then the president appoints advisors, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=255.84s)]
*  including Elon, including myself. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=260.08s)]
*  Look, I gotta be honest with everybody. I don't care who's in charge of Doge. It doesn't even [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=262.4s)]
*  matter. Okay, what matters is what's actually coming to fruition and what is happening under [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=265.76s)]
*  the Trump administration. And what is happening is all sorts of federal agencies are being [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  dismantled, some of which I don't care as much about as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=279.52s)]
*  Because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was literally the only good thing [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  the consumer financial protection bureau was literally the only good thing that came out of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=288.8s)]
*  the Obama response to the economic crisis that occurred in 2008. I'm not kidding. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=295.12s)]
*  Okay, the Dodd-Frank bill to regulate the banks was garbage. Okay, super watered down bill. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was the only government agency that was essentially [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=307.52s)]
*  serving as a cop on the beat when it came to financial institutions, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=313.28s)]
*  robbing us the American people. Okay, that matters to me. The lack of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  real analysis or methodology and firing federal workers. I don't even mind firing federal workers [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=325.11999999999995s)]
*  that we might not need. Okay, I do think that there's a lot of bloat in the federal government. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=330.64s)]
*  But can we at least do an appropriate analysis and ensure that the people who are being let go [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=334.88s)]
*  aren't important workers, people tasked with protecting our nuclear arsenal, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=341.92s)]
*  people tasked with researching avian flu, which is absolutely devastating Americans who want to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  buy eggs for their household. I mean, come on, just this isn't Twitter. Okay, I don't care about [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=354.32s)]
*  Twitter malfunctioning temporarily because Elon Musk bought it and fired a bunch of people without [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  thinking about it or doing an analysis. This is the American government. These are the American [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  people who fund the American government. And so there just needs to be a better way of doing this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=371.28s)]
*  But treating the federal government and these agencies and these programs as if it's the same [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=379.11999999999995s)]
*  as an annoying social media platform is insane to me. Absolutely insane. John? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=384.88s)]
*  John, no, all this is insane. Yeah, you have a process like everybody has said. There was a [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  process in the 90s where they tried to slim down government. They studied it. They didn't just fire [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  people and then go, yeah, the nukes do probably need some people looking after them. This world [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=401.04s)]
*  ending technology. Yeah, there is a bird flu epidemic. I guess we'll hire those people back. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=405.92s)]
*  The people doing the cutting right now who you are not allowed to know who they are. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=411.04s)]
*  And if you name them on social media, Elon Musk says you're breaking the law. So you mere peasant [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  don't hope to know who these people are. And again, can you imagine Republicans being okay [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=421.6s)]
*  with being told they're not allowed to know who's in charge of government departments that are Biden? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=425.6s)]
*  Obviously not. They are simply too stupid to be making these cuts. They don't know what they're [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=429.04s)]
*  doing. And why would they? On average, they're 16 and a half. They should be watching Rick and Morty. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=434.48s)]
*  They're not qualified for this and they've already proven it. Is that a hypothetical? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  And so all of this is obviously unacceptable. I hate for every person who watched the show that [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=444.0s)]
*  they have to see a clip of Stephen Miller. Nobody should have been cursed with that again. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  The fact that he can go on there and do his utterly condescending thing of, yeah, the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  president gets elected and he can. Look, I'm sure he's very happy that he has his government [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=458.24s)]
*  authority. I think that in the end, I'll have the last laugh because cosmically he's been cursed [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=463.36s)]
*  with what has to be the deep knowledge that he has never once come close to satisfying a woman [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=467.36s)]
*  sexually. And so that's gotta be at least some compensation for me having to see his big, stupid, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=472.48s)]
*  bald face. But anyway, we deserve better as a country. You could do these cuts. Have Elon [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=477.68s)]
*  Musk bring actual experts in, have them study it for a few months, and then tell Congress, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=483.36s)]
*  here are the things that we would like to cut. Here's the case that we're making. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=488.24s)]
*  Now we talked to them on Zoom for 10 minutes and we fired people who've been working there [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=492.48s)]
*  for 16 years that have mission critical information. I think that we should be able [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=495.76s)]
*  to expect at least a little bit out of the people that are being given this incredible amount of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=499.12s)]
*  power. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anW4JvPReYg&t=503.2s)]
