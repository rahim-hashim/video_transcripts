"In the largest single deployment of stealth bombers in U.S. history, the Pentagon has sent six B-2 ‚ÄúSpirit‚Äù aircraft to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.

The long-range bombers, which are uniquely suited to evade Iranian air defenses and can carry America‚Äôs most potent bunker busting weapons, flew in from Missouri last week in a little noticed operation."

# Trump Deploys RECORD NUMBER Of B-2 Bombers In Threat To Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc)
*  We're having direct talks with Iran and they've started, it'll go on Saturday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=0.0s)]
*  We have a very big meeting and we'll see what can happen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=6.92s)]
*  And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  And the obvious is not something that I wanna be involved with or frankly that Israel wants [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=18.84s)]
*  to be involved with if they can avoid it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=24.6s)]
*  So we're gonna see if we can avoid it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=26.52s)]
*  But look, if a hot war between the United States and Iran is something that President [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=29.6s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to avoid, he's got a funny way of showing it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=33.68s)]
*  Because the United States has just sent its single largest deployment of stealth bombers [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=38.04s)]
*  in history to essentially threaten Iran with war. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=44.54s)]
*  Now here's retired general Blaine Holt with more details on that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=48.52s)]
*  A large buildup of US bombers now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=52.6s)]
*  Tell us what you think the strategy is, obviously, the Houthis, Yemen terrorizing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=55.68s)]
*  And there's a map that really clearly puts out where it is and the strategic point that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=60.92s)]
*  sits out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=65.56s)]
*  Diego is such a strategic base and we have moved a third of our strategic bombers from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=66.56s)]
*  the B2 side there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=71.36s)]
*  We're sending a message. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=73.92s)]
*  This is a message of deterrence. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=74.92s)]
*  There's two carrier strike groups. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=76.52s)]
*  But it also gives the president a military option that he can actually use these weapons [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=78.08s)]
*  against Iran if needed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=82.56s)]
*  We could go take, if we have a nuclear weapons program to eliminate, could be done. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=84.24s)]
*  But what I think lends this self more to a deterrence package is the fact that all the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=88.36s)]
*  bombers, they're not in hangars. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  They're underneath satellites where they can be photographed and seen. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=96.08s)]
*  And the idea is, do you see our sword? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=99.24s)]
*  Because we could use this sword if we need to. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  Okay, deterrence from what? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=105.64s)]
*  From Iran building a nuclear weapon? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=108.1s)]
*  Because we had a nuclear deal in place that was negotiated under the Obama administration. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=110.82s)]
*  But Netanyahu didn't like it and wanted Trump to rip it up. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=117.58s)]
*  And Trump did as he was told and he ripped it up. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=121.66s)]
*  So what are we talking about here? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=124.13999999999999s)]
*  We want to talk about deterrence. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=126.02s)]
*  Let's talk about which country needs to be deterred, okay, from engaging in military [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=127.61999999999999s)]
*  action on sovereign soil in sovereign countries like Iran, by the way. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=132.26s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=138.01999999999998s)]
*  So what consequences, Israel assassinated people in Iran with, by the way, no consequences [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=139.02s)]
*  from Iran. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so we're about to tell you that about an important, though unfortunate ally we have [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=145.26000000000002s)]
*  in this fight. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=151.84s)]
*  But we need all the allies we can get to stop this war. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=152.84s)]
*  So first of all, if Trump does actually attack Iran, it would be the biggest piece of hypocrisy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=156.44s)]
*  you've ever seen. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=161.84s)]
*  And so maybe he could finesse a position on the budget here or taxes there and, well, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=163.17999999999998s)]
*  we cut this but we didn't cut that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=170.5s)]
*  But if he starts a giant war in the Middle East, there is no finessing running as an [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=172.5s)]
*  anti-war candidate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  And then starting a war with a country four times the size of Iraq because Netanyahu told [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=178.17999999999998s)]
*  you to. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=185.26s)]
*  So that would be his entire presidency. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=186.66s)]
*  And it would be the most unpopular thing you've ever seen. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  No one in the country wants to go to war with Iran. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  No one cares. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=196.82s)]
*  This is nonsense. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=197.89999999999998s)]
*  The only people who care are all in Washington and they all support Israel. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=199.73999999999998s)]
*  This has nothing to do with us. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=203.22s)]
*  I think Ben Shapiro is in Florida though. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=205.06s)]
*  Yeah, okay, whatever. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=206.89999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, or support Israel, I said, there you go. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=207.89999999999998s)]
*  And so the Israeli supporters want us to fight their war for them, as we've done now several [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=210.33999999999997s)]
*  times. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  And the people starting the wars are not the other side. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=216.85999999999999s)]
*  It's Israel demanding a war. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=220.54s)]
*  That's why Trump sheepishly looks at his boss and goes, nobody wants the war. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=222.9s)]
*  Of course, it's the new deal would be not even Israel. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=227.78s)]
*  No, they want the war. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=231.26s)]
*  Right, no, Netanyahu told him in the meeting, how many times do I have to tell you? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=232.62s)]
*  I want the goddamn war, put the B2s there, etc. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=236.45999999999998s)]
*  Now look, it doesn't mean you're definitely gonna get a war, because even Trump might [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=240.38s)]
*  understand how disastrous that is. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  So it's 50-50. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=249.08s)]
*  He follows almost everything Israel tells him to do. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=251.46s)]
*  But he ran on anti-war and this would be a catastrophe. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=254.36s)]
*  And we have some allies on the right wing that might actually help our cause. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=259.08000000000004s)]
*  So Ken Kiblenzai wrote about this whole situation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=262.82s)]
*  He's been following the escalations with Iran and his reporting is excellent. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=266.06s)]
*  He says that the bombers are uniquely suited to evade Iranian air defenses and can carry [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  America's most potent bunker busting weapons. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=277.2s)]
*  He also notes that the aircraft are not well suited for a sustained military operation. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  So the point about this really serving as a deterrent does stand. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=286.88s)]
*  However, as we know, one misstep in an escalating conflict and you can find yourself in a hot [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=291.2s)]
*  war, right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=299.68s)]
*  So I think that Trump is playing with fire here and to what end? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=300.68s)]
*  To what end and for what reason? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=304.72s)]
*  And we're gonna hear from Netanyahu in just a moment, but it's hard to see how that type [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=306.9s)]
*  of physical threat to Iran. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=311.3s)]
*  It's not hard to see how that kind of physical threat to Iran could cause things to basically [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=314.02s)]
*  get out of control, especially with Bibi Netanyahu in Trump's ear. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=318.14s)]
*  This week in the United States, by the way, will hold talks with Iran to negotiate a new [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=322.46s)]
*  nuclear deal. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=326.62s)]
*  And I hope that they reach a conclusion on that, they reach a deal on that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=328.06s)]
*  There was an Iran nuclear deal. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=332.38s)]
*  Netanyahu wasn't happy with it because he doesn't want a nuclear deal. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=334.08s)]
*  He wants the US to go to war with Iran because Iran supports the proxy groups that has attacked [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=337.12s)]
*  Israel, including Hamas in the past. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=343.36s)]
*  So according to Bibi, the United States will at the very least be exploding Iran's entire [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=346.08s)]
*  nuclear program and at most entering an all out war. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=353.4s)]
*  He says, quote, we agree that Iran must not be allowed to possess nuclear weapons. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=357.76s)]
*  This can be achieved through an agreement, but only if it is a Libya style agreement, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=363.14s)]
*  one where the facilities are entered, dismantled, and destroyed under American supervision and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  execution. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=374.18s)]
*  That's good. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=375.18s)]
*  Now, he also says, but should Iran drag out the talks, Netanyahu said, the second option [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=376.18s)]
*  would be a military one. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=382.4s)]
*  Everyone understands that, he said, adding that we discussed it at length. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=384.22s)]
*  Okay, well, then you send your troops to Iran if you want a hot war. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=387.9s)]
*  Why are we sending our troops to fight your war on your behalf? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, because they realized when they did the last bombing run, this is a really interesting [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=395.64s)]
*  intel of Iran, that the radars picked up the Israeli planes. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  And in fact, they turned around quickly and didn't drop as many bombs as they could. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=408.0s)]
*  So now they double down on making us go to war because they think the B2s will not be [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=414.64s)]
*  detected by the radar. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=419.56s)]
*  So basically Israel is saying, if we go to war with Iran, it'll be really messy and it'll [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=421.28s)]
*  cost us a lot in terms of planes and people and money. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  Why don't you suckers do it for us? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=432.38s)]
*  You suckers have already given us $300 billion throughout this entire time that Israel has [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=434.21999999999997s)]
*  existed. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=440.41999999999996s)]
*  Netanyahu was one of the neocons that pushed us into the Iraq war. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=441.41999999999996s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=444.94s)]
*  You suckers already went through a giant disastrous war on my behalf. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=445.94s)]
*  I think I could push you into any war. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, he's right. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  He has succeeded in doing that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  What would it make anyone think that Donald Trump would be any different? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=454.88s)]
*  Donald Trump has done Netanyahu and the Israeli government's bidding, I mean, certainly in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  his first administration, and he's continuing that trend in the second administration so [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=463.64s)]
*  far. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=467.36s)]
*  By the way, here's what Trump said just yesterday about Iran. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=468.36s)]
*  I think if the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is gonna be in great danger. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=473.44s)]
*  And I hate to say it, great danger because they can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=480.52s)]
*  It's not a complicated formula. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=484.58s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  That's all there is. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=490.85999999999996s)]
*  Can't have it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=491.85999999999996s)]
*  Right now we have countries that have nuclear power that shouldn't have it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=492.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=497.38s)]
*  I agree. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=499.18s)]
*  Iran shouldn't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=500.18s)]
*  They didn't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=502.29999999999995s)]
*  They weren't even enriching uranium because of the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama administration [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=503.58s)]
*  negotiated and was able to secure. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=508.68s)]
*  Our European allies were part of that deal as well. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=511.04s)]
*  There was oversight to ensure that they weren't secretly developing nuclear weapons. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=513.88s)]
*  But Trump came in and at the behest of Benjamin Netanyahu, ripped up that deal. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  And now all of a sudden we're pretending like, wow, Iran is building nuclear weapons. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=523.76s)]
*  And we had no part in any of that whatsoever. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=530.12s)]
*  I've gotta say two things here on their hypocrisy here. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=533.96s)]
*  So first of all, Trump in the beginning of his first term threatened North Korea and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=537.9s)]
*  said my button is bigger than your button. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=542.1s)]
*  And then Kim Jong-un did apparently a smart move. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=543.78s)]
*  He kissed Trump's ass and was like, I love you big guy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=547.06s)]
*  And then they wrote love letters back to each other. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=550.22s)]
*  I'm not exaggerating. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=551.74s)]
*  That's what Trump called him. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=552.74s)]
*  And so then what happened was Trump took his eye off the ball because he's like, as long [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=554.78s)]
*  as he's praising me, who cares? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=559.42s)]
*  And estimates are that North Korea built six nukes. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=561.34s)]
*  So this whole idea of we can't let bad governments build nukes. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=564.88s)]
*  And Trump is so strong and tough that when he's in charge, he's never gonna let anybody [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=569.0s)]
*  build a nuke. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  No, he let North Korea build nukes because the guy wrote him a nice letter. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  So that's a total BS excuse. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=579.94s)]
*  Second of all, Ana's right about this and it has been all throughout. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=582.48s)]
*  All the presidents, Bush went to war against Iraq because of Israel. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=585.48s)]
*  Biden did whatever they wanted. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=591.04s)]
*  Did whatever Israel wanted, etc. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=593.1800000000001s)]
*  One guy defined them for a little bit and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=595.74s)]
*  I don't think we've given him enough credit. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=597.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=598.7s)]
*  And that's Barack Obama. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=599.22s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=600.14s)]
*  Okay, so he didn't define them entirely. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=600.6600000000001s)]
*  He gave them Iron Dome, which was huge for them. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=603.1s)]
*  That's why another raucous land or almost another raucous land in Israel. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=607.34s)]
*  He gave them endless money, etc. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=610.6600000000001s)]
*  But one time he defined them, which is one more than any other president in my lifetime. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=612.3000000000001s)]
*  And that's when he said, no, I'm gonna do a deal with Iran. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=616.7s)]
*  And that deal was so good. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=619.5s)]
*  It was better than the Libya deal, if you ask me. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=621.0799999999999s)]
*  We took out all of the uranium and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=623.3599999999999s)]
*  prevented them from being able to do any, create any uranium inside Iran. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  So they had no chance at being able to build a nuclear weapon program. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=630.1199999999999s)]
*  So why did anyone in their right mind object to stopping Iran from building nukes, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=633.92s)]
*  which was supposed to be our purpose and peace is perfect, right? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=638.56s)]
*  The reason that the Israeli lobby objected so [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=641.8s)]
*  much is because then you have no reason or [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=645.0s)]
*  excuse for war. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=649.86s)]
*  And yes, they're worried about Iran's nuclear program, Israel is, okay? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=652.3000000000001s)]
*  But they're also mad at Iran for financing Hamas, Hezbollah, and the other groups. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=656.38s)]
*  So they're like, well, if we wipe out the Iranian regime and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=661.98s)]
*  we put in a puppet regime there, that will be the dogs of Israel. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=665.7s)]
*  Then we wiped out our major enemy in the Middle East. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=670.0600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, literally the only country now, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  they got problems with the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=676.1800000000001s)]
*  But for a long time, the only country opposing our occupation of Palestine and [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=678.68s)]
*  our land grabs and our stealing of land is the only one objecting is Iran. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  So I don't care about the peace deal, I don't want peace with Iran. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=688.52s)]
*  I want America to do another war for me and attack Iran. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=692.48s)]
*  So that's why they hated the Obama deal, not because it was bad, but [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=696.68s)]
*  because it was excellent. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=699.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=701.16s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=702.28s)]
*  Now, this isn't something that's said on this show often, but [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=703.88s)]
*  I don't credit where credit is due because Tucker Carlson is warning against [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=708.12s)]
*  going to war with Iran. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=712.94s)]
*  And I actually think he's being serious about this. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=714.9s)]
*  This is one of the more consistent things he's been saying. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=717.02s)]
*  So let's go to his post on X where he writes, whatever you think of tariffs, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=719.74s)]
*  it's clear that now is the worst possible time for [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=722.9s)]
*  the United States to participate in a military strike on Iran. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=725.34s)]
*  We can't afford it, thousands of Americans would die. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=728.82s)]
*  We'd lose the war that follows. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=732.0600000000001s)]
*  Nothing would be more destructive to our country. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=734.42s)]
*  And yet we're closer than ever thanks to unrelenting pressure from neocons. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=737.8s)]
*  This is suicidal. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  Anyone advocating for conflict with Iran is not an ally of the United States, but [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=743.4s)]
*  an enemy. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=747.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=748.64s)]
*  I agree with him on that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=749.16s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of countries that have nuclear weapons and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=750.16s)]
*  shouldn't, Israel has a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=753.6s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, by far the most likely to use it of all the powers in [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=756.64s)]
*  the world. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=761.0799999999999s)]
*  They immediately threatened to use it against Palestinians. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=761.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if they thought they were in any kind of danger, like 2% danger, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=764.06s)]
*  press it, press it, press it, press it, press it, press it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=768.0999999999999s)]
*  Like Russia and America were worried that it would be nuclear holocaust. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=771.18s)]
*  We're super worried about doing that. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=775.6999999999999s)]
*  France, even India and Pakistan, another super volatile area that I think is [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=777.5s)]
*  the second biggest problem. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=781.66s)]
*  But they get it, they'd kill themselves, right? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=783.14s)]
*  Because both sides have nukes. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=785.8199999999999s)]
*  But in Israel's case, both sides don't have nukes. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=787.66s)]
*  And the Israeli government is already fascistic and out of control. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=791.0s)]
*  The Israeli people are paranoid, if we're being honest about the culture currently [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=796.0s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=800.0s)]
*  And if they thought, my God, if they lost half of what the Palestinians lost in [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  Gaza, they would have already nuked someone. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=805.32s)]
*  100%. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=807.9200000000001s)]
*  So I would love to take away nukes from Iran and Israel. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=808.44s)]
*  But of course, Israel says no, only we get to have nukes and threaten and [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=813.48s)]
*  do whatever we want and no other country should oppose us. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=818.26s)]
*  Yeah, okay, I know, I know, you want the whole goddamn world. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=821.58s)]
*  Okay, so now for Tucker, there's a billion issues with Tucker, disagree with him on [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=824.1s)]
*  a thousand things. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=829.46s)]
*  And then people say this is hyperbole, but wait a minute, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=830.66s)]
*  he said thousands would die. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=833.14s)]
*  Again, Iran is four times larger than Iraq. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=834.86s)]
*  If we went to a full out war with Iran, would thousands die? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=837.54s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=840.42s)]
*  Thousands of Americans? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=840.94s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=841.54s)]
*  And they say, that's ridiculous to say we'd lose. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=844.02s)]
*  Did we win or lose Iraq? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=846.28s)]
*  I'm not really sure. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=848.8s)]
*  You think we're going to win in Iran? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=850.12s)]
*  We're going to bomb them. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=852.4s)]
*  And by the way, the neocons are totally back. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=854.3199999999999s)]
*  They're idiots on mainstream media going around saying, no, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=856.56s)]
*  we'll be greeted as liberators. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=860.08s)]
*  No, the Iranian people want us to bomb them because they hate the Iranian regime. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=861.68s)]
*  And so when we murder their grandmother and their children, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=865.76s)]
*  they're just going to love America and Israel. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=868.6s)]
*  And then they'll just reform everything. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=871.08s)]
*  Come on, guys. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=872.84s)]
*  So somebody, and I get asked this question a lot, but also today, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=874.5799999999999s)]
*  one of our members on Twitch, seppacrow1223 asked, here, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=878.78s)]
*  I'll just read the first line. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=882.38s)]
*  TYT keeps bringing up MAGA infighting like it validates their strategy. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=884.18s)]
*  But how does infighting help Cenk's strategy? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=887.9799999999999s)]
*  When you have Tucker Carlson and other right wing hosts going, no, no, no, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=891.9799999999999s)]
*  no, no, don't attack Iran, don't attack Israel. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=897.4599999999999s)]
*  If you think it doesn't matter at all, you're wrong. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=901.96s)]
*  Trump watches those guys. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=904.76s)]
*  Trump cares about that. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=906.72s)]
*  He's obsessed with media. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=908.52s)]
*  And if he thinks his media is on his side, he doesn't care about the left at all. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=911.04s)]
*  Okay, not 1%. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=914.68s)]
*  But if he thinks he's losing Tucker Carlson and his base- [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=916.48s)]
*  Dave Smith has been speaking out against the possibility of going to war with Iran. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=919.6s)]
*  And all those, Rogan, all those, he's a different character. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=924.1999999999999s)]
*  He's not Tucker Carlson. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=927.0799999999999s)]
*  They're different parts of the political spectrum. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=928.04s)]
*  But all those guys voted for Trump or supported Trump or endorsed Trump, and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=929.9s)]
*  they're all going, no, no war, no war, right? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=933.46s)]
*  Yeah, and it might not work, by the way. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=936.74s)]
*  It might not work. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=938.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=939.02s)]
*  Because as you've seen, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=939.54s)]
*  Trump has gone along with what Netanyahu wants perfectly. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=940.9s)]
*  He has ignored the will of his own supporters in his own base to go along [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=944.38s)]
*  with Netanyahu and his agenda, so it might not work at all. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=949.9399999999999s)]
*  But I will say this, I remember the preemptive war in Iraq during [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=955.02s)]
*  the Bush administration. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=958.56s)]
*  You want to know how much dissent there was within the Republican Party? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  Zero. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=962.52s)]
*  Zero, zero, zero. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  Now we have dissent everywhere. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=964.92s)]
*  Look, it's a 50-50 proposition. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=966.8s)]
*  I agree with Ana, he could easily do it too. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=968.88s)]
*  But remember one thing, so he does strike against General Kusum Soleimani, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=971.04s)]
*  mainly again because Israel asked him to. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=975.04s)]
*  There's some pretext about how we care for some reason. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=977.16s)]
*  And then, but when they asked Trump to do another bombing of Iran after Iran [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=980.4s)]
*  retaliated lightly, he said no. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=984.7199999999999s)]
*  He said no, that would cause too much conflict and war. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=987.9399999999999s)]
*  And so that was one of the most shocking things I've seen from Trump. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=991.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=994.3s)]
*  So since he has that instinct, and if his entire media side, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=994.8199999999999s)]
*  not even entire, but a big portion of his media in the right wing go, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=999.0999999999999s)]
*  no, don't do it, maybe it tips the scales to 5149. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1003.98s)]
*  And if you don't want to try that, I think that's crazy. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1008.06s)]
*  What's just because it offends your feelings to talk to a right winger, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1014.76s)]
*  you don't want to try to get allies there to stop the most disastrous war in [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1018.4799999999999s)]
*  our lifetime? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1022.1199999999999s)]
*  No, I'm going to try as hard as I can to stop that war and [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1023.5999999999999s)]
*  I'll talk to anyone to do it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1027.0s)]
*  I think it'd be better suited to just complain about it on Twitter. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1029.08s)]
*  Or you can go that route, or you could yell at them. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1032.9199999999998s)]
*  I bet they love that. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1035.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1036.32s)]
*  By the way, please don't go in there and start yelling at Trump that he's [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1036.9199999999998s)]
*  the fascist and the only etc. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1041.92s)]
*  And you don't attack Iran, you fascist racist. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1044.78s)]
*  That'll only make him want to do it. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1050.0600000000002s)]
*  Please use your minds, please. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1052.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm asking you to do a tiny, tiny amount of strategy. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1054.3400000000001s)]
*  Okay, Tucker Cross is the worst, don't ever talk to him. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1058.0600000000002s)]
*  I know, but brother, he has the same goal as us in this case. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1062.1000000000001s)]
*  Can we please take yes for an answer and [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1066.8200000000002s)]
*  build a coalition to stop a disastrous war? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1069.36s)]
*  It's like really a low bar. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1072.54s)]
*  We're asking for the bare minimum here. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1074.3799999999999s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1076.52s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQsRgFdf8Mc&t=1079.6s)]
