The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# MSNBC Fires Joy Reid, Keith Olbermann YELLS Racism
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY)
*  Joy Reid was fired by MSNBC. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=0.0s)]
*  There's lots of other ways to phrase this, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  and I'm sure they will dress this up to some degree. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=5.24s)]
*  This is contributing to the entirety of the Trump racism [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=7.96s)]
*  enveloping this country, and it is part of a stampede [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=11.84s)]
*  to see which formerly liberal company [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  can get to the head of the racism line, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=18.36s)]
*  the approved racism line, as fast as possible. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  And Joy Reid getting removed from the prime time lineup [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=25.36s)]
*  of MSNBC is MSNBC's biggest contribution yet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=28.28s)]
*  Joy Reid has been fired from MSNBC, and Keith Olbermann [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=33.04s)]
*  thinks that race has something to do with it, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=38.84s)]
*  even though she will be replaced with two black hosts [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  and a Latina host. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=44.88s)]
*  So I don't think it's about racism. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, well, for some people who've lost their minds [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=49.08s)]
*  like Keith Olbermann, everything's about racism. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=51.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  So although there is one thing that Joy Reid did [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=54.52s)]
*  that was positive that might have actually been the issue, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=56.54s)]
*  we'll get to that in a sec. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=59.78s)]
*  Now, before we get to that, I should also note [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=61.06s)]
*  that Keith Olbermann is now pointing fingers [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  at other MSNBC hosts and essentially demanding [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=65.02s)]
*  that they step down for Joy Reid's sake, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=67.86s)]
*  and that includes Rachel Maddow, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=71.02s)]
*  Lawrence O'Donnell, and Chris Hayes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=72.34s)]
*  Let's go to his post where he says, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=74.1s)]
*  Dear Maddow, if you go on the air tonight, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=75.94s)]
*  or at a minimum, go on without condemning the overt racism [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=78.94s)]
*  of the people who give you $25 million a year, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=82.86s)]
*  you are complicit. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=85.54s)]
*  Same for you, Lawrence O'Donnell and Chris Hayes, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=86.98s)]
*  protest or you are all Joe Scarborough. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=89.42s)]
*  Now, of course, it goes without saying, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=92.54s)]
*  Keith Olbermann used to be a host at MSNBC [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=94.58s)]
*  before he too was fired from his position. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=96.82s)]
*  But let's get to the details here because- [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=99.74s)]
*  Yeah, sorry, real quick on one thing there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=102.06s)]
*  Nice lib on lib crime there because unfortunately, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=104.62s)]
*  some version of liberal Democrats [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=108.1s)]
*  are saying racism about everything. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=110.2s)]
*  And so Rachel Maddow normally does that, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=112.42s)]
*  but now Olbermann is flipping it on Rachel Maddow. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  So you better say racism, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=117.06s)]
*  even though it makes no sense in this context. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=118.86s)]
*  Otherwise, you don't deserve that salary or whatever. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=121.3s)]
*  To be fair to Keith Olbermann, Rachel Maddow has that job [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  purely because of Keith Olbermann. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=126.66s)]
*  So as much as I dislike Keith Olbermann, I'm always fair. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=128.46s)]
*  And he absolutely made sure that she got that job. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=132.06s)]
*  I hate all these people. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=135.1s)]
*  Okay, let's just move on. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=136.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=137.7s)]
*  So who will Joy Reid be replaced with? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=138.54s)]
*  Simone Townsend Sanders, former Bernie Sanders, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=141.38s)]
*  press secretary. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=145.02s)]
*  She was also an advisor to both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=146.38s)]
*  Alicia Menendez, that's actually Bob Menendez's daughter. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=151.34s)]
*  But yeah, that's all I have about her. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=155.18s)]
*  She also hosts a show on MSNBC. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=157.7s)]
*  And then you have Michael Steele, former Republican, and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=160.18s)]
*  also former chair of the Republican National Committee. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=164.3s)]
*  So- Uniparty. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=167.38s)]
*  Yes, so all three of them actually had been hosting a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  different show on MSNBC called The Weekend. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=172.22s)]
*  The Weekend will now have three new hosts. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  And these three individuals will be hosting a panel show in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=179.06s)]
*  the hour where Joy Reid's show is currently airing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=183.1s)]
*  Her last episode will take place this week. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=187.14s)]
*  Now we have criticized Joy Reid plenty on this show for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=190.26s)]
*  making statements like this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=194.66s)]
*  And I think it's important to say that anyone who has [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=197.7s)]
*  experienced or been in the United States for any period of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=200.9s)]
*  time and experienced this country's history and knows it, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=204.34s)]
*  cannot have believed that it would be easy to elect a woman [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=207.62s)]
*  president, let alone a woman of color. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=210.9s)]
*  Let's just be clear. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=213.22s)]
*  And nothing that was true yesterday about how flawlessly [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  this campaign was run is not true now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=218.62s)]
*  I mean, this really was an historic flawlessly run [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=221.42s)]
*  campaign. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=224.94s)]
*  Queen Latifah never endorses anyone. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=226.22s)]
*  She came out and endorsed. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=228.34s)]
*  I mean, she had every prominent celebrity voice. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=230.02s)]
*  She had the Taylor Swifties, she had the Swifties, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=234.34s)]
*  she had the Beehive. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  You could not have run a better campaign in that short period [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  of time, and I think that's still true. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  So look, I gotta say her election analysis was awful. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  Lots of what she had to say in spreading weird conspiracy [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=247.66000000000003s)]
*  theories after the first assassination attempt against [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=252.22s)]
*  Donald Trump, I thought that was awful. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=254.82s)]
*  But we are the fairest show, and there were some examples of her [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=256.9s)]
*  doing commentary that I thought was actually pretty courageous, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=261.06s)]
*  considering the monotonous mainstream media narrative [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=264.74s)]
*  that's always pro-Israel while hiding the suffering of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=269.14s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=273.42s)]
*  Joy Reid did excellent commentary on that issue, and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=274.82s)]
*  I wanna give you an example. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=277.46s)]
*  You can't judge every Palestinian or every Muslim or [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=279.14s)]
*  every Arab based on what Hamas did any more than you could have [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=281.5s)]
*  judged every American by the fact that some Americans elected [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=284.58s)]
*  a religious extremist, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=288.3s)]
*  an religious extremist backed wannabe autocrat. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=290.02s)]
*  Being for Palestinians' freedom and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  staying alive does not mean you love Hamas or support them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=294.5s)]
*  The Hamas attack killed an estimated 1,400 people, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=299.02s)]
*  including children, according to Israeli authorities. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=301.7s)]
*  And as of tonight, the death toll in Gaza has topped 8,000 since [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=304.53999999999996s)]
*  October 7th, including 3,400 children, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=308.5s)]
*  according to the Gaza Health Ministry. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=312.70000000000005s)]
*  President Biden may say he doesn't believe Palestinians when they say [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=315.02000000000004s)]
*  how many of them have been killed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=317.94s)]
*  But reporting by news organizations like the AP Reuters, the BBC, and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  our own reporters on the ground, make it clear that the numbers of dead and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  the devastation in Gaza are staggering. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=328.22s)]
*  The US is warning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to rein in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=330.94000000000005s)]
*  extremist settlers in the occupied West Bank in the wake of reports of violence [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  against Palestinians there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=340.26000000000005s)]
*  And given these bombings are being done using our tax dollars, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=342.06s)]
*  perhaps we should ask some questions. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=345.3s)]
*  For example, how does bombing a densely populated land strip filled 50% with [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=347.9s)]
*  children constitute self-defense? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=352.86s)]
*  MSNBC has now gotten rid of pretty much every host that has dared to speak out [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  in favor of protecting Palestinian civilian lives. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=360.7s)]
*  The other person who just got fired, what's the name of that? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=364.22s)]
*  Alex Wagner, and she didn't get fired. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=368.1s)]
*  She's still a contributor, but she used to be at 9 o'clock in Rachel's spot, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=370.22s)]
*  Tuesday through Thursday, and they took her off. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=373.98s)]
*  That's not who I was referring to though. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=376.14s)]
*  I'm in Mohai. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=377.74s)]
*  Mohail, no, he wasn't fired. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=379.74s)]
*  He actually got a little bit more time or better time slot, and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=381.58s)]
*  so did Ali Velshi. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=385.3s)]
*  So they did their, look, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=386.66s)]
*  we don't know exactly why they made these moves, okay? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=388.58s)]
*  Are you talking about what happened today? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=393.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=394.98s)]
*  There was an update today, okay, go ahead. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=395.5s)]
*  Okay, so look, they take Jorah Reed out, she's African American, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=396.62s)]
*  they put in two African Americans and a little bit of Tina. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=400.41999999999996s)]
*  So they took out everyone in prime time who had said something positive about [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=404.34s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=408.53999999999996s)]
*  But on the weekends, they gave those two Muslim American hosts a little bit extra [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=409.65999999999997s)]
*  time or better time slot. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=413.62s)]
*  So they're covering their bases on all the identity politics stuff. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=415.18s)]
*  So look, there's so many components to this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=418.97999999999996s)]
*  Number one, yeah, again, we don't know if they did it because of their position on [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=421.53999999999996s)]
*  Palestine, but it is, here we go again, you're in favor of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=425.94s)]
*  Palestine, it's prime time, you're gone. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=430.94s)]
*  So but back to the main core here, they're just going more establishment. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=433.06s)]
*  They're bringing in Jen Psaki at 9 o'clock Tuesday through Friday. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=438.54s)]
*  Jen Psaki, literally the mouthpiece for the Biden administration. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=441.66s)]
*  Earlier in the lineup is Nicole Wallace, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=445.3s)]
*  literally the mouthpiece for the Bush administration. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=446.98s)]
*  So what we have here is uniparty extraordinaire. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=449.34s)]
*  And I think it's a terrible strategy on top of everything else. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=453.22s)]
*  So MSNBC and CNN are going to split up the establishment viewers, all 12 of them, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=456.14s)]
*  they all live in Washington. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=461.42s)]
*  It's an awful strategy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=463.46s)]
*  And all they're trying to do is check off each box for the powerful. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=465.34000000000003s)]
*  This lobby wants that, this party wants that, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=469.3s)]
*  this part of the establishment wants this. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=472.1s)]
*  Yes, but what do the viewers want? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=474.18s)]
*  So I don't really care anymore because down television is nearly dead and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=476.5s)]
*  these guys ability to move Democratic voters is greatly diminished. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=480.42s)]
*  They were a giant propaganda machine that costs progressives and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=484.46s)]
*  populists in every primary. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=488.38s)]
*  They will never give populists a fair shake at MSNBC. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=490.54s)]
*  The press describing Joy Reid as a progressive is absurd. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=494.78s)]
*  No one was more pro establishment than Joy Reid. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=499.74s)]
*  But as much as I disagreed with Joy Reid, I'm also not in the camp of celebrating [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=502.58s)]
*  her tears, which some people are doing because she cried on a show about it at [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=506.78s)]
*  the time is very understandable. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=510.34s)]
*  And it's a moment like this where you show dignity and grace, because what are [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=512.18s)]
*  you beating up on her for? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=516.1s)]
*  She's not in power anymore. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=517.5s)]
*  She doesn't have that show anymore. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=518.74s)]
*  So when you criticize people in power, it's for a purpose. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=520.86s)]
*  But now that she's not there anymore, let it go guys. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=524.6999999999999s)]
*  So no need to beat up on her at all anymore. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=528.38s)]
*  And then of course, lastly, Trump is threatening to shut down MSNBC and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=531.38s)]
*  wants them to pay him a bribe or whatever the hell he thinks he's doing with [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=535.38s)]
*  demanding money from media organizations that criticize him. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=539.4599999999999s)]
*  So of all the people that are wrong here, Trump found a way to be even more wrong [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=542.66s)]
*  than all the rest of them. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=547.3399999999999s)]
*  So this is not going to help MSNBC. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=548.5799999999999s)]
*  And they're going to be just as anti progressive, anti populist as they have [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=551.5s)]
*  always been, even more so. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=555.38s)]
*  And they will take this train all the way off that cliff, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=558.06s)]
*  because they have no ability to recover. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=562.62s)]
*  They don't know anyone who's in the regular population, any real voters. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=566.3s)]
*  They're an insular little bubble of establishment folks who are patting [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=572.3399999999999s)]
*  themselves on the back. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=575.74s)]
*  But this thing's almost over already. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=577.02s)]
*  It's just rearranging chairs on the Titanic. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=579.02s)]
*  All right, in the bonus episode, we have more amazing stories for you guys. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=582.06s)]
*  So my God, the Democrats doing the same thing they did before, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=587.5s)]
*  including some of their donors complaining. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=591.9799999999999s)]
*  But wait, were they this part of the problem? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=594.78s)]
*  The Biden team is back and saying Biden would have won. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaSKQu4FZEY&t=596.82s)]
