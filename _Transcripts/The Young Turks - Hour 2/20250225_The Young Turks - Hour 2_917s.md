The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Why DOGE Staffers Resigned En Masse
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo)
*  Today, 21 civil servants that worked with the Department of Government Efficiency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=0.0s)]
*  stepped down and resigned in protest of Elon Musk's haphazard dismantling of the federal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=6.0s)]
*  government. Now, here's an important thing to note here, big caveat, these anonymous employees [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=12.24s)]
*  had actually worked for the US Digital Service, which was an executive branch unit that was then [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=18.56s)]
*  rebranded by Musk and Trump as the United States DOGE service. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=25.52s)]
*  And so these federal workers were already there when DOGE was created, they were not hired by [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=32.24s)]
*  Elon Musk. Nonetheless, the group includes engineers, data scientists, and product managers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  So in a letter that they wrote to Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff, they explained their [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=46.72s)]
*  decision to step down. And I'm curious what you think about how this is all kind of developing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=52.32s)]
*  Yeah, so in the beginning, I thought that these were Elon Musk guys, and then I was like, whoa, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=57.92s)]
*  DOGE guys are quitting, there must be something crazy going on. So it's not that, but what it is, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=64.32s)]
*  is also very revealing because of a couple things that these guys said, not just their [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=69.92s)]
*  resignation, but their specific reasons. So let's get into that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=75.12s)]
*  So they write to Susie Wiles, Donald Trump's chief of staff. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=78.72s)]
*  Each of us left senior private sector technology positions to pursue nonpartisan public service. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=82.8s)]
*  We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  presidential administrations. However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=94.32s)]
*  commitments at the United States DOGE service. On January 21st, we were subjected to 15 minute [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=100.0s)]
*  interviews by individuals wearing White House visitor badges. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=108.24s)]
*  Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=112.24s)]
*  loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  This process created significant security risks and was designed to intimidate government employees. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=126.72s)]
*  On February 14th, one third of our USDS colleagues were indiscriminately terminated by [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=133.44s)]
*  an anonymous email. These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize social security, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=141.84s)]
*  veteran services, tax filing, healthcare, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  So those who remained, about 65 staffers, were then integrated into DOGE's government slashing effort. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=156.96s)]
*  And honestly, now they've had enough. So they also say we will not use our skills as technologists [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=165.36s)]
*  to compromise core government systems, jeopardize American sensitive data, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=172.88s)]
*  or dismantle critical public services. We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=178.0s)]
*  DOGE's actions. The resignations now reduce the Department of Government efficiency by roughly [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=185.12s)]
*  a third. But in response, White House spokesperson, Caroline Levitt, was pretty dismissive and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=192.8s)]
*  essentially stated that protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will not deter Donald Trump. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=199.04s)]
*  Yeah, because he's in the middle of doing lawfare against James Comey today. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=205.44s)]
*  So he's apparently not bothered by it at all. Okay, so now this is super important for a couple [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  reasons. Look at the things that they demanded, political loyalty. They had limited technical [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=214.48s)]
*  ability. So remember, Musk said, I brought in these geniuses in DOGE. They're actually young guys [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=220.16s)]
*  who are political ideologues. And that's what every interaction at a government agency, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=226.56s)]
*  they're reporting back the same thing. They're looking for political litmus tests, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=231.44s)]
*  loyalty litmus tests, right? They're just a bunch of meatheads who, they're not geniuses at all. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=234.72s)]
*  They need these tech guys, right? So what happened to the tech geniuses? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=240.0s)]
*  Why are you lost without the actual tech people? And what are they doing? Intimidating [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=244.24s)]
*  government employees. Look, I can't right now tell you that I know for a fact that there's a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=249.52s)]
*  giant robbery coming. But I can tell you that if you were going to do a giant robbery, this is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=254.72s)]
*  exactly how you would do it. What's the first thing you would do? You would say, you'd fire all the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=259.92s)]
*  cops so you can't get arrested. So all the regulators at the SEC, the IRS, gone, CFPB gone [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=264.48s)]
*  entirely. Any kind of regulator, Wall Street, crypto, the 50 guys working on crypto regulations [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  moved out at the SEC and one other organization. So all the cops are gone, okay, check. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=278.56s)]
*  Second of all, you do political and loyalty tests to all the government officials you deal with [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  to make sure that you're not gonna say anything now, are you? You're a team player, aren't you? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=290.0s)]
*  That's exactly what if you're doing a criminal enterprise, you need loyalty over competence. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=295.76s)]
*  Look at that, they don't actually have competence, but they have loyalty and they're demanding [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=300.4s)]
*  loyalty. And you do one last thing, you'd reduce transparency. And that's why we have this absurd [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=304.0s)]
*  thing of wait, does Elon Musk run Doge or doesn't he run Doge? Because of course he runs Doge and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=310.24s)]
*  Trump, since he doesn't know anything is like, yeah, what do you mean? Of course he runs it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=315.92s)]
*  But in court, they're saying no, he doesn't, why? Because we don't wanna show you any of his [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=319.44s)]
*  financial interests. There's giant conflicts of interest that you would have to report [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=325.52s)]
*  if he was an employee of the government. So they don't want to report his giant conflicts of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=329.84s)]
*  interest. So what happened to radical transparency? It's the exact opposite. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=334.48s)]
*  Then you'd cover up your side so that no one could see what you were doing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=338.32s)]
*  If you're gonna do a robbery, that is exactly how you would do it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=342.24s)]
*  So now these guys resigning are the 200th red flag in a row going, this isn't gonna end well. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=346.4s)]
*  Look, the one silver lining here, I've told you from day one, whatever money they're gonna do [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=355.28s)]
*  legitimately in four and a half trillion dollars in tax cuts that they announced this week. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=361.36s)]
*  And whatever they're going to do illegitimately, if anything, that money's already gone. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  Because that's their number one priority before anybody finds out what the hell's going on, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=372.0s)]
*  that money's gonna be gone, okay? It's so gone. In my opinion, we'll see how it goes. It's a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=375.52s)]
*  prediction. I don't have any inside information, okay? But afterwards, the silver lining is [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=381.92s)]
*  the American people are going to be furious, furious. And if you think that, yeah, they won't [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=389.36s)]
*  mind that they got robbed because they got robbed by Elon and he's so cool and he's so pro-maga. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=397.28s)]
*  All right, let's see what happens. Maybe he's not gonna do a robbery. Maybe he's doing it out of the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=403.2s)]
*  goodness of his heart for the American people. Is Elon cool? I mean, his shenanigans at CPAC [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=406.79999999999995s)]
*  were super cringe. Can I just tell you guys, look- [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=414.32s)]
*  Super cringe. Guys, guys, guys, we've been covering politics for so long. It's all theater. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  So the Democratic politicians do the thing that their voters want, especially their donors and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=423.04s)]
*  their elites. So they'll come in and all sophisticated and they'll support the Kennedy [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=428.0s)]
*  Center and they'll do that kind of play acting. Golly gee, we care about you and Nancy Pelosi [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=431.92s)]
*  will talk about her universal healthcare poster she has in her basement from 48 years ago. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=437.36s)]
*  And said it's all theater, they're acting. So same thing with the Republican establishment. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=442.8s)]
*  Now Trump is a different kind of actor, Elon Musk. So why did Elon Musk go from Democrats, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=447.92s)]
*  theoretically, to hardcore maga on all issues, on all? He didn't change a little bit. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=452.8s)]
*  He apparently flip-flopped on all of his issues because he's acting. He doesn't care about any [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=459.76s)]
*  of those things. He's just saying the things that he thinks will get the right wing to like him [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  because he thinks the right wing was going to win the election. That way he would get to be in power. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=470.64s)]
*  Oh look, he's in power and runs almost the entire government and has his young thugs [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  going around the government, intimidating people, threatening people, firing people. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  But what are they going to do with that? The letter that he's now resending. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  You can't read 3 million letters as to why your job should exist. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=491.91999999999996s)]
*  They're literally talking about having an algorithm. AI decide who's going to get fired. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=495.76s)]
*  This is not going to end well. They're going to run right into a brick wall called American [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  citizens. And they think they're so arrogant. They're like, we got everybody tricked. Elon's [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=506.48s)]
*  such a great actor and Trump's such a great actor. Yeah, let's see how that turns out. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=510.88s)]
*  So the FAA announced today that they have agreed to use SpaceX's Starlink internet system to upgrade [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=514.8s)]
*  the information technology networks it uses to manage US airspace. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=524.64s)]
*  Raising some concerns about conflicts of interest. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=530.48s)]
*  Huh, look at that right away. The top donor to Donald Trump, huge contract. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=532.64s)]
*  Okay, let me just finish detailing it. Okay, before you interrupt with your anger and rage. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=537.76s)]
*  We don't know how much the contract is for yet, but this is- [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=543.92s)]
*  A lot. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=546.16s)]
*  Okay. All right. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=547.04s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=548.16s)]
*  Let's get to the rest of it. Let's get to the rest of the story. So if you're wondering how much [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=548.56s)]
*  government waste has been rooted out by Doge. It turns out that they have been providing [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=552.48s)]
*  where the cuts have been happening. And an analysis of those cuts show that [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=560.72s)]
*  they're not actually saving much money. So look, this really has to do with the fact [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  that some of the funding is kind of guaranteed for the programs that have been slashed. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=572.4s)]
*  So I wanna get to the details on that. So the Associated Press has revealed that the agency's [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=577.76s)]
*  own data indicates that 40% of the contracts canceled by Doge have saved American taxpayers [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=586.96s)]
*  no money at all. So there was already some pretty questionable accounting being done. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=594.4s)]
*  In addition to typos in Doge's numbers that seem to inflate the amount of money that the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=599.92s)]
*  you know government efficiency agency was saving American people. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=605.84s)]
*  For instance, there was one mistake where they mistakenly included an $8 billion contract in [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=610.32s)]
*  their calculations when it was really an $8 million contract. And the latest reporting also [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=617.12s)]
*  bolsters claims that Musk is kind of juicing his own numbers. The Department of Government Efficiency [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=623.04s)]
*  published an updated list Monday of nearly 2,300 contracts that agencies terminated in [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=628.96s)]
*  recent weeks across the federal government. Data published on Doge's wall of receipts [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=634.72s)]
*  showed that more than one third of those contract cancellations, which is 794 and all, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=640.1600000000001s)]
*  are expected to yield no savings. Now, why is that? That sounds kind of crazy, right? Well, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  that's usually because the total value of the contracts has already been fully obligated, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=652.88s)]
*  which means the government has a legal requirement to spend the funds for the goods or services it [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=658.32s)]
*  purchased and in many cases has already done so. Okay, so what did I tell you guys? You come in [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=665.36s)]
*  with a blind axe and you chop away, but you don't even know what you're chopping. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=672.24s)]
*  It's the definition of dumb. If you want to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, this is not how you [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=677.6s)]
*  would do it. So 40% of the contracts already paid, but now some of them we already got the goods or [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=682.48s)]
*  services, some of them we didn't. So now you cancel a contract we already paid, but now we're [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=689.28s)]
*  not going to get the thing we paid for. How does that help? And then at the CDC, they're like, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=696.64s)]
*  oh, there's a consulting that they're paying $13 million to. I forget if it was McKinsey or [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=701.28s)]
*  whoever it is, one of the big consulting firms and, haha, we got them. But we already paid them, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=706.8s)]
*  and it turns out they were looking to reduce the CDC and they were going to take away two [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=713.5999999999999s)]
*  offices because they had already decided that it was bloated and they were getting paid to reduce [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=718.88s)]
*  it. But now they won't reduce it. They'll just take the money, but won't reduce it. How did that [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=723.92s)]
*  help? If you cut without looking, it is by definition dumb. Okay, I'm sorry, Ana, can you [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=729.04s)]
*  please go back to Starlink and tell us what happened there? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=736.32s)]
*  Yeah, so we don't know what the dollar amount for that contract is yet. This story just broke [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=738.0400000000001s)]
*  today, earlier today. CNN Business is specifically reporting it. But this is, look, obviously the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=743.12s)]
*  federal government under Biden had contracts with Starlink, right? So it's not unheard of for this [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=750.72s)]
*  to happen. But it becomes a much bigger issue when Elon Musk, of course the founder and CEO of these [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=757.2s)]
*  companies, is working super closely with the federal government and the President of the United [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=765.04s)]
*  States, essentially calling the shots in firing federal workers and cutting federal programs [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=769.4399999999999s)]
*  as an unelected official. And then also getting all sorts of sweet deals by the federal government [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=777.04s)]
*  as he's playing this role within the Trump administration. And so that, look, that conflict [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=783.04s)]
*  of interest is real. It is a problem. And if anyone thinks that the richest man in the world [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  is looking out for blue collared American workers as he's cutting jobs left and right, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=793.76s)]
*  I mean, you really, I have a bridge to sell you, okay? I have a pyramid scheme to get you involved. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=799.84s)]
*  And this is- Yeah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=805.12s)]
*  It's crazy. So, looks, fair show in America. Starlink is an amazing company, and I don't think [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=806.88s)]
*  all of Elon's companies are amazing, okay? I think Tesla's, I don't know, what the hell [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=813.76s)]
*  they do with that value? That's a whole separate story, right? But Starlink is an amazing company. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=819.6s)]
*  But now you're telling me that you're not doing Pentagon cuts. You're doing Pentagon realignment. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=824.72s)]
*  And now some of that money is going to your company. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=830.48s)]
*  But that's not what anybody voted for. That's not what MAGA voted for. That's not what [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=835.6s)]
*  we voted for. Nobody voted for, do realignment so that we don't save any money, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=839.84s)]
*  but we give all that money to Donald Trump's top donor. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=846.24s)]
*  So, look, last thing. I think that they think they're cute and they're never gonna get caught. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=850.8s)]
*  And I think that they're very wrong about that. And part of what they assume is [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=859.28s)]
*  the right wing is gullible. They'll just back us no matter what till the end of time. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=864.0s)]
*  And I know they think that, the left wing thinks that. I'm apparently the only person who ironically [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=869.28s)]
*  believes a little bit in those voters and who thinks, no, they're gonna catch you. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  And when they catch you, they're gonna be furious. It hasn't happened yet and probably [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=880.0s)]
*  won't happen for a long time. But eventually, everybody gets caught. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=884.0s)]
*  I will say once their Medicaid benefits are cut, once they start feeling the economic consequences [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=887.44s)]
*  of what's currently transpiring. When a service they need from the federal government is no longer [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=896.4s)]
*  available. When big banks are able to do whatever the hell they want without a cop on the beat. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=901.84s)]
*  Yeah, maybe some of them will change their minds, but we'll wait and see. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_RsJBP8ATo&t=907.12s)]
