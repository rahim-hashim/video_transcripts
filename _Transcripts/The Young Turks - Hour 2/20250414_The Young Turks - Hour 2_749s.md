"The Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer ‚Äì considered to be a 2028 White House Democratic contender ‚Äì was trying to distance herself from a recent Oval Office appearance alongside Donald Trump, which saw her get photographed while blocking her face with binders.

Whitmer visited the Republican president on Wednesday alongside a bipartisan delegation to discuss a northern Michigan ice storm, the state‚Äôs defense assets and tariffs, among other issues. Following the meeting, Whitmer was brought into the Oval Office where she ‚Äì as the New York Times described ‚Äì ‚Äústood glumly‚Äù during a press conference that saw Trump sign several executive orders that targeted his political opponents."

# Gretchen Whitmer HIDES During White House Meeting
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU)
*  Governor Whitmer, this story, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm going to give it to Charlie [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=2.0s)]
*  because he's the one that brought [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=4.0s)]
*  it to my attention. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=6.0s)]
*  And it's just too much. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=7.0s)]
*  Because of course Donald Trump is [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=8.0s)]
*  in the Oval Office talking about [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=10.0s)]
*  some of his key accomplishments, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=12.0s)]
*  not the least of which is his new [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=14.0s)]
*  tack on trade in the United States. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=16.0s)]
*  And Gretchen Whitmer winds up in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=19.0s)]
*  the Oval Office and as she's there- [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=21.0s)]
*  I thought this was a fake fight. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=23.0s)]
*  I did too. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=25.0s)]
*  I thought this was AI. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=26.0s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=27.0s)]
*  As hard as she might try, Michigan [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=31.0s)]
*  Governor Gretchen Whitmer isn't [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=33.0s)]
*  able to hide from the waves of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=35.0s)]
*  backlash she is receiving over her [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=37.0s)]
*  recent Oval Office appearance. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=39.0s)]
*  I mean, talk about binders full of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=41.0s)]
*  women. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=43.0s)]
*  This is what Mitt Romney meant. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=44.0s)]
*  They're hiding behind them, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=46.0s)]
*  who knows? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=48.0s)]
*  Now, Cenk, we'll get to you in a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=49.0s)]
*  second, but first some context. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=50.0s)]
*  Gretchen Whitmer made an unexpected, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=52.0s)]
*  at least to her, appearance in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=54.0s)]
*  front of the White House press [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=55.0s)]
*  corps and their cameras inside [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=56.0s)]
*  the Oval last week. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=58.0s)]
*  Whitmer is allegedly in Washington [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=60.0s)]
*  for a one-on-one meeting with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=62.0s)]
*  Trump to discuss funding for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=64.0s)]
*  an Air National Guard base near [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=66.0s)]
*  Detroit and to potentially obtain [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=68.0s)]
*  aid for those who have been [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=70.0s)]
*  affected by a recent ice storm in [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=72.0s)]
*  the state. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=74.0s)]
*  But that one-on-one meeting took [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=75.0s)]
*  a turn. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=77.0s)]
*  Trump's aides surprised her by [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=78.0s)]
*  ushering her into the Oval Office [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=79.0s)]
*  for a politically loaded [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=80.0s)]
*  appearance before the press corps. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=81.0s)]
*  She found herself an unwilling [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=82.0s)]
*  participant in his unending reality [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=83.0s)]
*  show with photos of her rocketing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=85.0s)]
*  around group chats of Democratic [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=87.0s)]
*  strategists who wondered what on [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=88.0s)]
*  Earth she was doing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=90.0s)]
*  According to the Times, she just [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=91.0s)]
*  stood there glumly hoping nobody [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=92.0s)]
*  would take her picture. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=94.0s)]
*  And then she hid, literally, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=95.0s)]
*  behind files. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=98.0s)]
*  This is the most politically obtuse, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=100.0s)]
*  novice move ever. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=102.0s)]
*  She really might have killed her [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=104.0s)]
*  political career here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=105.0s)]
*  I don't know how you're not aware [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=106.0s)]
*  this is going to be used in every [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=108.0s)]
*  attack at against you the rest of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=109.0s)]
*  your political life. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=111.0s)]
*  And obviously going to cause more [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=112.0s)]
*  photos to be taken of you in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=114.0s)]
*  the moment, thoroughly confused, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=116.0s)]
*  more info coming in a moment. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=117.0s)]
*  But Cenk, I know you must be [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=119.0s)]
*  excited to try me on. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=121.0s)]
*  No, no, okay, take it back. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=122.0s)]
*  Cenk's not here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=124.0s)]
*  He couldn't be here today, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=125.0s)]
*  you guys. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=126.0s)]
*  Cenk clearly has disappeared. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=127.0s)]
*  Cenk's gone again. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=129.0s)]
*  He was back for brief moment, but [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=131.0s)]
*  now he's gone. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=133.0s)]
*  One more time, where did he go? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=134.0s)]
*  Where did Cenk keep going? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=137.0s)]
*  How does he do that? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=138.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=139.0s)]
*  God, these politicians are awful. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=140.0s)]
*  God, that's embarrassing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=142.0s)]
*  I get it, you got brought in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=144.0s)]
*  the room, you didn't expect to get [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=146.0s)]
*  brought into the room. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=148.0s)]
*  Guess what's going to happen in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=149.0s)]
*  the Oval Office pictures. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=150.0s)]
*  The minute you enter the room, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=151.0s)]
*  there's going to be pictures. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=152.0s)]
*  You got to calculate that in and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=154.0s)]
*  move on with your life. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=155.0s)]
*  Look, here's what I want to tell [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=157.0s)]
*  Democratic politicians overall. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=158.0s)]
*  You have a mouth, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=160.0s)]
*  words come out of it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=162.0s)]
*  You can later make your case and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=164.0s)]
*  go, I was surprised, I didn't know [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=165.0s)]
*  I was going into the Oval Office. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=167.0s)]
*  But what am I going to do, be [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=168.0s)]
*  disrespectful to the president and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=169.0s)]
*  walk out? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=171.0s)]
*  That's not how I roll, and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=172.0s)]
*  I don't care who it is, and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=173.0s)]
*  I don't care how much I disagree. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=174.0s)]
*  I'm going to stay there and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=175.0s)]
*  we're going to take some pictures [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=176.0s)]
*  and that doesn't mean I endorse [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=177.0s)]
*  what he's doing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=178.0s)]
*  In fact, the orders that he signed, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=179.0s)]
*  I totally disagree with. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=181.0s)]
*  And let me tell you why I disagree [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=182.0s)]
*  with them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=183.0s)]
*  That's how you would handle it if [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=184.0s)]
*  you were strong. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=185.0s)]
*  Here's how you would handle it if [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=186.0s)]
*  you're a Democrat these days. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=188.0s)]
*  Come on, guys, Jesus Christ, man. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=195.0s)]
*  Grow a spine and do something. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=198.0s)]
*  But the very last thing you should [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=200.0s)]
*  do is hide behind a binder. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=202.0s)]
*  Hide behind a binder. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=204.0s)]
*  Yes, that is true, that is true. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=205.0s)]
*  And a little bit perhaps in her [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=208.0s)]
*  defense, she was there actually [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=210.0s)]
*  agreeing with Trump on some things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=212.0s)]
*  He was talking about this invasive [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=214.0s)]
*  fish species that was affecting [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=216.0s)]
*  her stay of Michigan and she chimed [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=218.0s)]
*  in and agreed. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=220.0s)]
*  She supposedly also agreed, said [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=221.0s)]
*  she agreed with what he's doing on [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=223.0s)]
*  tariffs, which is hard to imagine, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=225.0s)]
*  but supposedly that's the case. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=227.0s)]
*  And she hid when he brought up [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=229.0s)]
*  election integrity and rigged a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=231.0s)]
*  elections. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=233.0s)]
*  And so it's possible, this is a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=234.0s)]
*  photo, I haven't seen the video of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=236.0s)]
*  it, maybe she just quickly went [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=238.0s)]
*  like this as like a boy, like to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=240.0s)]
*  publicly say. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=242.0s)]
*  No, no, she admits it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=243.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=244.0s)]
*  She's like, I didn't know what to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=245.0s)]
*  do, I didn't want a picture in [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=246.0s)]
*  there. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=247.0s)]
*  I mean, like- Right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=248.0s)]
*  And so at least she's not- [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=249.0s)]
*  Better roll your eyes, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=251.0s)]
*  better roll your eyes- Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=252.0s)]
*  Than do that for sure. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=253.0s)]
*  And of course, the two of them have [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=255.0s)]
*  had a very contentious past, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=257.0s)]
*  Whitmer and Trump, especially over [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=259.0s)]
*  Trump's response to the COVID-19 [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=261.0s)]
*  pandemic. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=262.0s)]
*  At the time, Trump said he had a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=263.0s)]
*  big problem with the young, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=265.0s)]
*  a woman governor in Michigan, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=267.0s)]
*  adding that all she does is sit [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=269.0s)]
*  there and blame the federal [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=270.0s)]
*  government. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=271.0s)]
*  Whitmer, sorry, it's not anymore [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=272.0s)]
*  a quote, Whitmer meanwhile, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=274.0s)]
*  blame, I was really embodying him [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=275.0s)]
*  there, Whitmer meanwhile blamed [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=277.0s)]
*  Trump for a failed plot to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=279.0s)]
*  kidnap her that was devised by [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=280.0s)]
*  right-wing extremists, a case [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=282.0s)]
*  that led to nine convictions. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=283.0s)]
*  But apparently that's all water [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=285.0s)]
*  under the bridge now, and they've [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=286.0s)]
*  buried the hatchet. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=288.0s)]
*  Because the day after the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=289.0s)]
*  inauguration, Whitmer pandemic [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=290.0s)]
*  declaration, Whitmer penned a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=291.0s)]
*  handwritten letter which had not [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=292.0s)]
*  been previously reported, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=293.0s)]
*  congratulating Trump saying she [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=294.0s)]
*  looked forward to working together [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=295.0s)]
*  and praising his support for [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=297.0s)]
*  the auto industry in his first [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=298.0s)]
*  address, according to a person who [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=299.0s)]
*  relayed the text of the letter. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=301.0s)]
*  Whitmer included her cell phone [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=303.0s)]
*  number and invited Trump to call [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=304.0s)]
*  her if she could be of any help to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=305.0s)]
*  him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=306.0s)]
*  And in this meeting as well, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=307.0s)]
*  Trump praised Whitmer in the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=309.0s)]
*  beginning and said, we're honored [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=311.0s)]
*  to have the governor of Michigan [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=313.0s)]
*  here who's doing a really great [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=315.0s)]
*  job. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=317.0s)]
*  So if they're buddy buddy, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=318.0s)]
*  what was she hiding? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=319.0s)]
*  Why was she hiding? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=320.0s)]
*  Well, because she was playing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=321.0s)]
*  Trump's game and didn't want [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=322.0s)]
*  anybody to know about it, it seems. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=323.0s)]
*  Many Democrats see Trump as [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=325.0s)]
*  a transactional politician who is [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=326.0s)]
*  susceptible to flattery and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=328.0s)]
*  are acutely aware of how he has [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=329.0s)]
*  sought to punish liberal states and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=330.0s)]
*  groups. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=332.0s)]
*  He has aimed to cut off billions of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=333.0s)]
*  dollars to universities and states [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=335.0s)]
*  with Democratic governors and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=336.0s)]
*  threatened funding for local [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=337.0s)]
*  public education and public health, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=338.0s)]
*  leaving state leaders scrambling [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=340.0s)]
*  to find alternative sources of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=342.0s)]
*  cash or cut spending in other [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=343.0s)]
*  areas. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=344.0s)]
*  But this is a dangerous game and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=345.0s)]
*  the stakes are very high, obviously. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=347.0s)]
*  And now her political features on [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=349.0s)]
*  the line because she was caught [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=350.0s)]
*  playing, just caught getting [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=352.0s)]
*  swooped right into Trump's plan [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=354.0s)]
*  and forced to sort of endorse [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=356.0s)]
*  things he did. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=358.0s)]
*  And then trying to hide when she [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=359.0s)]
*  realized she was in over her head [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=361.0s)]
*  by binders, I suppose. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=363.0s)]
*  Keith Obermann posted when the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=364.0s)]
*  report came out, it's rare when you [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=366.0s)]
*  get a shot of the exact moment a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=368.0s)]
*  politician's career ends, but [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=370.0s)]
*  there you go. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=372.0s)]
*  I was pretty impressed with that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=373.0s)]
*  Keith Obermann impression that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=374.0s)]
*  it's kind of made up right there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=375.0s)]
*  A lot of governors, especially [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=376.0s)]
*  Democratic ones, are gearing up [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=378.0s)]
*  for not only reelection bids in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=380.0s)]
*  2026, but for the 2028 presidential [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=382.0s)]
*  primary. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=384.0s)]
*  And getting support from their [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=385.0s)]
*  home states, of course, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=386.0s)]
*  is crucial. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=387.0s)]
*  Quote, Democrats from the center [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=388.0s)]
*  to the left believe Trump is an [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=389.0s)]
*  autocrat who represents an [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=390.0s)]
*  existential threat to democracy [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=391.0s)]
*  and our rights. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=393.0s)]
*  Democratic voters expect their [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=394.0s)]
*  leaders to meet the moment by [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=395.0s)]
*  fighting his dictatorial attacks. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=396.0s)]
*  Attacks not placate, negotiate, or [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=398.0s)]
*  assuage because doing so makes him [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=400.0s)]
*  stronger and bullies others more. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=402.0s)]
*  According to Neera Tanden, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=404.0s)]
*  chief executive of the Center for [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=405.0s)]
*  American Progress, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=406.0s)]
*  now to Whitmer's defense, she [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=407.0s)]
*  stated in the past that she does [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=409.0s)]
*  not regard herself as the leader [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=411.0s)]
*  of the opposition against Trump. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=413.0s)]
*  And she's been trying to work with [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=415.0s)]
*  Republicans, she told the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=416.0s)]
*  Associated Press in January. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=417.0s)]
*  I've shared with some of my [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=419.0s)]
*  colleagues from some of the very [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=420.0s)]
*  blue states that my situation here [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=421.0s)]
*  in Michigan is very different than [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=422.0s)]
*  theirs. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=424.0s)]
*  I've got a Republican House [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=425.0s)]
*  representatives, majority [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=426.0s)]
*  Republican House, now to work [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=427.0s)]
*  with. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=428.0s)]
*  And following her appearance, she [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=429.0s)]
*  brushed off the criticism and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=431.0s)]
*  blow back by simply stating, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=432.0s)]
*  it's not where I wanted to be or [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=434.0s)]
*  plan to be or would have liked to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=436.0s)]
*  have been. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=437.0s)]
*  I disagree with a lot of stuff [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=438.0s)]
*  that was said in the actions that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=439.0s)]
*  were taken. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=440.0s)]
*  But I stayed in the room because I [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=441.0s)]
*  needed to make the case for [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=442.0s)]
*  Michigan and that's my job. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=443.0s)]
*  She also tried to laugh it off [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=445.0s)]
*  during an appearance at the Detroit [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=446.0s)]
*  Economic Club stating she didn't [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=448.0s)]
*  just want her picture taken, just [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=449.0s)]
*  didn't want her picture taken and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=451.0s)]
*  that's all it was. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=453.0s)]
*  However, her office did attempt to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=454.0s)]
*  do some damage control by saying [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=456.0s)]
*  her presence is not an endorsement [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=458.0s)]
*  of the actions taken or [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=460.0s)]
*  statements made at that event. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=461.0s)]
*  However, she may have not even [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=464.0s)]
*  made those statements because at [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=465.0s)]
*  one point during those statements, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=466.0s)]
*  she went like this. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=468.0s)]
*  Okay, so, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=469.0s)]
*  Obermann might have meant that even [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=471.0s)]
*  staying in the room would [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=474.0s)]
*  end her career because he's like a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=476.0s)]
*  radical on that stuff. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=478.0s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Obermann. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=480.0s)]
*  The audacity during a time like [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=482.0s)]
*  this when our lives are on the line [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=484.0s)]
*  to endorse the mere fact, the mere [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=486.0s)]
*  existence of Donald Trump as [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=488.0s)]
*  a legitimate president calls this [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=490.0s)]
*  union into question. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=492.0s)]
*  It's not bad, it's getting there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=493.0s)]
*  Okay, so but his tweet was funny, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=495.0s)]
*  fair show in America. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=498.0s)]
*  Okay, and true. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=499.0s)]
*  And so to me, it reminded me of [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=500.0s)]
*  Veep, they show it was such a Veep [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=503.0s)]
*  moment that's so what Julia Lewis [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=506.0s)]
*  Strievers' character would do. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=509.0s)]
*  And Tony Hale coming up to her [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=511.0s)]
*  afterwards and being like, I [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=513.0s)]
*  thought it was pretty great when [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=514.0s)]
*  you hid there behind the plant in [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=516.0s)]
*  the corner and then the headlines [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=518.0s)]
*  the next day, Travesty hiding [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=520.0s)]
*  behind the plant. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=522.0s)]
*  Totally, totally. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=523.0s)]
*  So Democratic politicians these [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=524.0s)]
*  days don't cover themselves in [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=527.0s)]
*  glory, okay? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=529.0s)]
*  Figure out a path guys and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=530.0s)]
*  stick with it and hiding is [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=532.0s)]
*  definitely not the right path. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=534.0s)]
*  That one we could eliminate whether [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=536.0s)]
*  it's behind binders or plants or [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=538.0s)]
*  anything else. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=540.0s)]
*  So get out there, have a plan. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=541.0s)]
*  You don't have to be maniacal and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=544.0s)]
*  oppose everything Trump does and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=546.0s)]
*  call all of his voters dirty names [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=548.0s)]
*  etc. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=550.0s)]
*  You don't have to sit there and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=551.0s)]
*  do nothing, okay? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=553.0s)]
*  You could actually figure out, hey, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=554.0s)]
*  what do I agree with whatever small [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=556.0s)]
*  amount there is, okay, then happy [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=558.0s)]
*  to be reasonable there because [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=560.0s)]
*  Trump's coming to us. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=562.0s)]
*  On everything else, we fight them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=563.0s)]
*  We fight them and we fight [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=565.0s)]
*  effectively and we don't do it in [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=566.0s)]
*  some weird maniacal way. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=567.0s)]
*  We do it in a way that regains the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=568.0s)]
*  majority of Americans to our side [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=571.0s)]
*  because we're actually [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=574.0s)]
*  representing them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=576.0s)]
*  But there's no world in which you [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=578.0s)]
*  are fighting back or [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=581.0s)]
*  you're representing your voters [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=583.0s)]
*  from behind something else. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=586.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like you remember [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=588.0s)]
*  that statement they used to make [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=589.0s)]
*  fun of Obama and it wasn't quite [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=590.0s)]
*  fair because he didn't really say [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=592.0s)]
*  that but of leading from behind. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=594.0s)]
*  Like this is literally leading from [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=596.0s)]
*  behind binders and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=598.0s)]
*  that's not leading and that's clear. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=599.0s)]
*  But that said, is there a world in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=601.0s)]
*  which she was trying to actually, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=603.0s)]
*  I mean she didn't, but [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=605.0s)]
*  she kind of defended it in that way [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=606.0s)]
*  saying she didn't want to be there. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=608.0s)]
*  She didn't want her picture taken [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=610.0s)]
*  in that moment. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=612.0s)]
*  It's almost, I mean, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=613.0s)]
*  is she this dumb or did she actually [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=614.0s)]
*  know that this move would get [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=616.0s)]
*  coverage and it's actually sort of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=618.0s)]
*  a strong act of resistance in front [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=620.0s)]
*  of the man's face to cover your [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=622.0s)]
*  face and know he's going to hear [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=624.0s)]
*  about that and know that she was [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=626.0s)]
*  publicly admitting she did not want [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=628.0s)]
*  to be associated with him in that [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=630.0s)]
*  moment. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=632.0s)]
*  Maybe it's a bold move to some [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=633.0s)]
*  degree. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=635.0s)]
*  It won't be used that way. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=636.0s)]
*  That was a nice effort. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=638.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=639.0s)]
*  Okay, no, 100% no. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=640.0s)]
*  Okay, so I mean, how does that, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=643.0s)]
*  it makes you look so weak, right? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=645.0s)]
*  So there's so many other ways to [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=647.0s)]
*  handle it that's strong, right? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=649.0s)]
*  Okay, if you want to- [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=651.0s)]
*  An eye roll would be so [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=652.0s)]
*  much more strong because- [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=653.0s)]
*  I mean, you could do sarcasm, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=654.0s)]
*  you could do sarcasm, eye roll, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=656.0s)]
*  etc. Or you could just like, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=658.0s)]
*  you know what, you could call a [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=660.0s)]
*  press conference in Michigan or [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=662.0s)]
*  you could just look after it, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=664.0s)]
*  right? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=665.0s)]
*  And go, hey, you know what, I want [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=665.5s)]
*  to tell you guys something. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=667.0s)]
*  I went there because I needed to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=668.0s)]
*  work with President Trump on this [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=669.0s)]
*  issue in Michigan. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=670.0s)]
*  And I'm proud that I worked with [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=671.0s)]
*  President Trump on that issue. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=672.0s)]
*  And I'm glad that he came to us and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=673.0s)]
*  was good on that issue. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=675.0s)]
*  But then during that Oval Office [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=676.0s)]
*  meeting, he did two executive [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=678.0s)]
*  orders that I hated. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=680.0s)]
*  And let me tell you why I did and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=681.0s)]
*  why I object to it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=683.0s)]
*  Or she could call a press [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=684.0s)]
*  conference and go- [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=686.0s)]
*  True, and it would have been so [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=687.0s)]
*  much stronger if she stood there. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=689.0s)]
*  If that even eye rolled, just [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=691.0s)]
*  like vehemently shaking her head [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=692.0s)]
*  knowing the thing she disagreed [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=693.0s)]
*  with, that would have gotten [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=694.0s)]
*  covered and also looked strong. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=695.0s)]
*  That's called the Uyghur on [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=696.0s)]
*  Piers Morgan. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=698.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=699.0s)]
*  So when I don't agree with [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=700.0s)]
*  something, and you can see me on [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=702.0s)]
*  camera on Piers Morgan or any other [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=705.0s)]
*  show, you know it, right? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=708.0s)]
*  And next time though, I will try [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=710.0s)]
*  that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=712.0s)]
*  You should try it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=713.0s)]
*  I have a hard time reading your [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=714.0s)]
*  emotions when you're on camera. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=715.0s)]
*  It's really hard. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=716.0s)]
*  A lot of subtlety with how you [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=717.0s)]
*  feel. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=719.0s)]
*  Well, I'm a self-centered person, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=720.0s)]
*  I'm a self-spoken guy. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=722.0s)]
*  You really are. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=724.0s)]
*  Yeah, and so I'm glad you every [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=725.0s)]
*  once in a while you can suss out [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=727.0s)]
*  my real opinions. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=729.0s)]
*  Sometimes I get a sense, but I'm [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=730.0s)]
*  going on a limb a lot of the time [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=731.0s)]
*  guessing. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwWeMgEBNU&t=732.0s)]
