The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump's New SCAM To Rip Off MAGA
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw)
*  There will be a reliable source of individuals, companies and foreign governments that see [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=0.0s)]
*  this, see buying these coins, these tokens as a very convenient way to pay off the president [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=7.44s)]
*  for favors. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=14.24s)]
*  If you're the Saudi government, you no longer need to pretend to stay at a Trump hotel in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=15.24s)]
*  order to give money to Donald Trump, to bribe Donald Trump. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=21.16s)]
*  You can just show your digital wallet and that is sufficient. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=24.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's newly launched meme coin could be used to bribe our newly elected president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=30.08s)]
*  Only time will tell if that prediction plays out the way some are predicting it will. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=37.48s)]
*  But what we do know is that some who have already invested in the Trump meme coin have [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=42.32s)]
*  already lost an enormous sum of money. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=48.32s)]
*  So let's get to those details. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  So Trump launched this meme coin, which is titled Trump with a dollar sign before it [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=52.02s)]
*  on Friday evening. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=57.74s)]
*  He wrote about it on Truth Social to promote it saying my new official Trump meme is here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=59.5s)]
*  It's time to celebrate everything we stand for winning. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=64.86s)]
*  Join my very special Trump community and then it tells you how you can invest in the Trump [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  coin. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=73.06s)]
*  Now a disclosure on that website explains that the value of the meme coin is purely [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=74.06s)]
*  symbolic which I hope anyone looking to invest in the coin is paying close attention to. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=79.46s)]
*  It reads that Trump memes are intended to function as an expression of support for and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=85.53999999999999s)]
*  engagement with the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol Trump as the associated artwork [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=90.58s)]
*  and are not intended to be or to be the subject of an investment opportunity, investment contract [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=97.94s)]
*  or security of any type. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=105.8s)]
*  Now a buying frenzy commenced after the meme coin launched, sending its value to an unbelievable [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=108.14s)]
*  $15 billion by Sunday evening. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=114.22s)]
*  And by that same day, Melania Trump released or launched her own meme coin, Melania, and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=118.7s)]
*  soon the price of Trump's meme coin tanked. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=126.14s)]
*  So take a look at this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=129.78s)]
*  This graph will show you what we're talking about here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=131.22s)]
*  So this graph shows the price of the Trump meme coin and how it changed over time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=133.4s)]
*  It peaked at just over $75 on Sunday. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=137.98s)]
*  And you can also see when the meme coin crashed on Sunday reaching a low of $38. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=142.94s)]
*  And so the overall value went from $15 billion to $7.5 billion, okay? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=149.1s)]
*  So bear with us for a bit because we're gonna get into the finer details in just a moment. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=157.5s)]
*  In fact, Cenk, why don't you get into the finer details? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=163.22s)]
*  Let me explain the essence of it and then we'll give you the details. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  So look, this coin is worth absolutely nothing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=169.9s)]
*  And because when you invest in a company in the stock market, you say, hey, I think GM [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  is going to do well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=180.73999999999998s)]
*  And when they sell more cars, their value is naturally gonna go up and I'm going to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  benefit from that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=186.78s)]
*  So I'm gonna buy it at $10, hope that it goes to 15. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  So that makes sense. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=191.66s)]
*  There's a lot of issues with that, but overall there's logic to it, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  You're buying stock in a company that is actually worth something. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=196.17999999999998s)]
*  In this case, you're buying a meme coin. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=199.98s)]
*  You know what that's worth? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=202.42s)]
*  I'm gonna use the D word. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=203.42s)]
*  But okay, I'm gonna say absolutely nothing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  It's worth nothing at all. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=209.82s)]
*  And that's why they have to do those disclaimers saying this is not an investment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=211.82s)]
*  This is not anything. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  They might as well write in the disclaimer, you guys are morons for buying this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=216.85999999999999s)]
*  Now look, I don't wanna yell at you guys cuz you're already getting robbed. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=220.3s)]
*  I just wanna explain it in hopes of helping you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=223.02s)]
*  And so this is not for the left wing, you're not gonna buy this crap anyway. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=227.34s)]
*  It's not for independence or anything. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=230.62s)]
*  This is for the right wing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=231.86s)]
*  Guys, Trump insiders buy in the beginning when it first comes out, Trump already has [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=233.18s)]
*  80% of it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=238.82000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't need to buy anything, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=239.82000000000002s)]
*  But Trump insiders buy it in the beginning when it costs very little, then you guys drive [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=241.78s)]
*  up the price. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=246.62s)]
*  So they'll make up numbers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=247.62s)]
*  They'll buy a 10. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=249.1s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=250.1s)]
*  And then they'll sell 50. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=251.1s)]
*  But who are they selling it to? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=253.62s)]
*  They're selling to you, Trump supporters. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=255.18s)]
*  You buy it at 50. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=257.14s)]
*  And then when it drops back down to 10, you lost all that money. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=258.14s)]
*  You pump it, they dump it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=262.9s)]
*  That's the best way to think about it, okay? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=264.14s)]
*  Exactly, so what it is is it's a way of literally robbing Trump's own supporters. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=265.9s)]
*  It's so messed up. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=271.18s)]
*  It's like- It's wealth redistribution from you guys to the top. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=272.18s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=276.26s)]
*  A good way to think about this, recently the Haq Tua girl was embroiled in controversy [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=277.26s)]
*  because she had her own meme coin and the allegations of pump and dump schemes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=281.82s)]
*  So don't think that your favorite politicians won't victimize you in a similar way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=286.9s)]
*  So to Jake's point, he's correct, okay? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  So 80% of the Trump meme coin is already owned by two Trump affiliated companies, CIC Digital [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  affiliated with the Trump Organization and Fight Fight Fight LLC, a newly incorporated [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=303.18s)]
*  business that we know little about. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=308.7s)]
*  But as you can imagine, it is also associated with Donald Trump. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=311.14000000000004s)]
*  So 200 million Trump meme coins have been released. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=314.38s)]
*  The 800 million remaining Trump meme coins, which again are held by those two companies, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=318.26s)]
*  will be released sometime in the future and they can sell as soon as this coming April. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=324.1s)]
*  So understand that Trump and his insiders have slightly different motivations. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=329.68s)]
*  Trump needs that meme coin to do well in the markets until April and that's when he can [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=334.32s)]
*  start dumping it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=340.12s)]
*  So he needs to keep that price up until April. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=341.44s)]
*  So as he sees the price going down, he's gotta be a little bit pissed that all of his insiders [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=344.26s)]
*  are making crazy money while he hasn't made anything yet. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=348.0s)]
*  But it looks like they're gonna, foreign governments and companies that want favors, individuals [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=351.12s)]
*  and so on, are gonna pump so much money into that thing that he's gonna finally be the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=355.6s)]
*  multi-billionaire he always dreamed of being. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=360.48s)]
*  It looks like, but we'll see. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  So a few other things I want you to be aware of moving forward. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=364.36s)]
*  We gave you one of the disclaimers. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=368.0s)]
*  The other thing you should know about investing in this meme coin is you're gonna agree to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=369.5s)]
*  the terms and the terms mean that you have no real legal recourse. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=376.12s)]
*  So let's go to graphic seven here. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=381.1s)]
*  The terms and conditions of both Trump and Melania bars buyers from joining class action [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=382.74s)]
*  lawsuits against the project and indemnify the project against any claims. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=387.98s)]
*  By the way, that's the thing that- [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=395.18s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=396.82s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy Jr. hates when it's the drug companies doing it and other corporations [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=397.82s)]
*  doing it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=402.1s)]
*  Yeah, everyone should hate this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=403.1s)]
*  This is terrible. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=404.1s)]
*  Yeah, that basically says we're above the law. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=405.1s)]
*  No matter how much we rip you off, there's nothing you can do about it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=406.1s)]
*  It makes sense to put that in the disclaimer because this is a thing that is pretty much [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=408.74s)]
*  only purpose is to rip you off. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=412.53999999999996s)]
*  It's like the only thing you can give it of any value is just speculation. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=415.02s)]
*  Like hey, I got an early and I got it at 20. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=418.82s)]
*  These are made up numbers just so you understand. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=421.86s)]
*  I got it at 25 and I sold it at 50. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=423.94s)]
*  So I made a difference there even though I'm not a Trump insider. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=426.94s)]
*  Okay, but remember it's a time bomb. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=430.14s)]
*  At some point it's gonna crater because it's not actually worth anything. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=432.5s)]
*  Now Dave Portnoy who is a Trump supporter has been very critical of this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=437.14s)]
*  A number of people have actually. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=442.7s)]
*  People on the right see this for the scam it is and I commend them for speaking out [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=444.82s)]
*  against it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=448.74s)]
*  Dave Portnoy is one of those people. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=449.74s)]
*  He's the owner and founder of Barstool Sports. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=451.14s)]
*  He wrote about the meme coins on X saying, I have a dumb two part question. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=453.82s)]
*  Number one, what's the difference between the hock to a coin and the Trump coin besides [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=459.65999999999997s)]
*  nothing? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=465.14s)]
*  Number two, can I string up my own coin now and tell people it's a Ponzi scheme from the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=467.09999999999997s)]
*  jump and I'm going to rug pull at some point. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=473.46s)]
*  And you better just hope you're out when I do it and that would make the entire thing [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=477.78s)]
*  legal. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=482.46s)]
*  You got it exactly right Dave and you can. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=483.5s)]
*  And in fact, that's a little bit of how Doge started in the first place. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=485.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=489.7s)]
*  Yeah, and Elon Musk started as a joke because he's like this is ridiculous. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=491.21999999999997s)]
*  These things have no value. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=494.58s)]
*  Then people started just giving him money and he's like, wait a minute, this has a lot [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=495.9s)]
*  of value. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=500.5s)]
*  I get to and if I buy X and I get people all riled up about how great I am, they'll want [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=501.5s)]
*  to buy more of my useless Doge coin, right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=506.53999999999996s)]
*  And then I'll go pay off Donald Trump and then I'll get him to declare the most important [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=509.18s)]
*  government agency Doge. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=513.3s)]
*  That'll be great marketing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=514.78s)]
*  More suckers will give me more money for free. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  So but by the way though, this is why I say at some point I think the right wing base [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=518.8199999999999s)]
*  will turn on Trump on some things, not on everything. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=523.78s)]
*  Well, because they have different media. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=527.3s)]
*  Portnoy is part of the media. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=528.82s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of the bros. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=531.42s)]
*  He's closer to the Joe Rogan's of the world than he is to the Trumps. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=532.86s)]
*  So when he sees a scam, he has no incentive to not say, hey, wait a minute, that's a scam. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=537.9s)]
*  Right, yeah, and it's important that he does. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=542.54s)]
*  Look, I don't want people to get hurt. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=544.46s)]
*  I don't want people to lose money. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=545.74s)]
*  If you think it's too good to be true, it is good to, good to, like fast money is not [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=548.5s)]
*  a good idea. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=553.58s)]
*  Like you're gonna lose. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=554.58s)]
*  These people are playing you. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=555.94s)]
*  Just please be smart and proceed with caution, especially when it comes to cryptocurrency [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=557.4000000000001s)]
*  and meme coins. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=561.44s)]
*  I can't believe that Trump is doing this, but here we are. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=563.1s)]
*  I can totally believe it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=565.86s)]
*  No, I can believe it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=566.86s)]
*  But it's so brazen and transparent. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=567.86s)]
*  That's what I- And remember guys, in all of this, especially [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=571.5400000000001s)]
*  this, he's ripping off his own supporters, the people who trusted him the most. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=574.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPUpsomm9Yw&t=578.58s)]
