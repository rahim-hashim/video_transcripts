The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Senate Republicans: We're Okay With Debanking Americans
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c)
*  But one of the first watchdog agencies that Trump administration and Elon targeted was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=0.0s)]
*  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=6.08s)]
*  Despite previous cries from Republicans and senators over debanking, yesterday the Senate [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=8.76s)]
*  took action that showed they really don't care about that at all. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Senate Republicans on Wednesday moved to allow payment apps like Venmo and PayPal to return [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=20.16s)]
*  to ideological debanking. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=25.36s)]
*  Repealing a rule implemented in December by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=29.04s)]
*  The vote on Wednesday afternoon won the support of every Senate Republican who voted, with [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  the exception of Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has regularly broken with his party in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=37.84s)]
*  support of populist economic policies. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=42.24s)]
*  The resolution to repeal the rule did not require the typical 60 votes to move forward, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=44.36s)]
*  meaning Republicans could repeal the debanking rule with just 51 votes and without needing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=49.0s)]
*  Democratic support. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  Now the House must pass a companion measure and will track the developments there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=55.68s)]
*  But already, Republicans are seeing pushback from within their ranks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=61.0s)]
*  Right wing agitator Laura Loomer posted, happening now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=65.28s)]
*  Senate Republicans are voting to legalize debanking by voting to remove a CFPB rule [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=69.24s)]
*  that bans payment apps from banning people without cause. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=75.08s)]
*  I don't wanna hear the GOP call themselves the free speech party ever again. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=78.76s)]
*  She continued. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=82.84s)]
*  Every Senate Republican, with the exception of Josh Hawley, just voted to legalize debanking. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=84.28s)]
*  Now apps like PayPal can get away with banning you for your political views thanks to Senate [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=90.12s)]
*  Republicans who just voted to repeal a rule that made that illegal in December 2024. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=93.52s)]
*  To which Elon Musk replied, really? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=99.92s)]
*  Yes, really. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Hopefully you can put an end to this, Elon Musk. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=105.28s)]
*  The GOP doesn't like the CFPB and so they are now just opposing everything CFPB has [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=107.68s)]
*  done, including the good things like implementing a law in 2024 that banned payment platforms [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=113.24s)]
*  like PayPal, Stripe and Venmo from banning people based off their political affiliation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  Senate GOP just voted to legalize debanking. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  They should kill the companion bill off in the House. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=125.6s)]
*  Now I'm not saying Laura Loomer is reflective of a large portion of the Republican Party, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=129.68s)]
*  but I gotta imagine after all the cries, especially from Republican supporters, Cenk, there might [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=134.12s)]
*  be many people, many voters who are upset by this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=139.96s)]
*  Look, told you, here's what I mean by that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=144.4s)]
*  What I said was, in the past, media was such a monopoly that a lot of times Democrats got [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=149.32s)]
*  their information from one news source. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=156.48s)]
*  And really it's just mainstream media. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=160.32s)]
*  So you might have gotten it on MSNBC or CNN or New York Times, but those are all kind [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=161.92s)]
*  of in the same group thing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  But for Republicans, it was basically just Fox News and talk radio, and they were always [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=168.14s)]
*  on the same message. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  It was Hannity on the radio, Hannity on TV, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=175.33999999999997s)]
*  And whenever I talked to Republicans, they would always regurgitate the talking points [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=178.61999999999998s)]
*  on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh, every single time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=182.7s)]
*  And there was no variety, they never broke lines, etc. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=185.7s)]
*  Now they have all sorts of media. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  They've got Laura Loomer over here and Charlie Kirk over there and Steve Bannon over there [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=192.22s)]
*  and Tucker over here and Patrick but David and Tim Pool. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=196.62s)]
*  And are they on the same page on a lot of issues? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=200.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=203.34s)]
*  Are they on different pages from time to time? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=204.34s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=206.34s)]
*  I mean, Steve Bannon's at war with Elon Musk. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=207.34s)]
*  Laura Loomer challenging them left and right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=210.18s)]
*  Laura Loomer terrible on issues regarding Muslims, she hates them, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=213.14s)]
*  Just awful. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=218.22s)]
*  Steve Bannon terrible on immigration, etc. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=219.22s)]
*  But here's Laura Loomer going, wait a minute. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=221.18s)]
*  I hate debanking and some of us have been debanked. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  So I know this one. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=229.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, they're lying. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=231.38s)]
*  There you go. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  Exactly, okay? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  So they're getting caught by their own side and it's happening more and more. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=236.22s)]
*  And there's not just three or four different shows. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=240.83999999999997s)]
*  There's now dozens of right wing shows, independent shows, bro shows, which are totally different [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=242.82s)]
*  animal, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=249.14s)]
*  I mean, watch Theovon on Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=250.14s)]
*  Watch Joe Rogan on Israel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=252.7s)]
*  They're not toeing any line, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=254.26s)]
*  And Trump loves Israel, so what, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=256.5s)]
*  And so now, the truth is starting to leak out all over the place. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=259.82s)]
*  They got leakage, they can't stop. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=264.62s)]
*  They plug a hole there, another one sprouts out, another one sprouts out. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=266.53999999999996s)]
*  They're gonna get caught on all this stuff. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=269.9s)]
*  This is just the beginning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=271.82s)]
*  I mean, it's the first 45 days, right? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=272.82s)]
*  But on CFPB, they lied and they said CFPB is doing the debanking. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=274.9s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=279.74s)]
*  They're gonna agitate the right wing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  They say, they're debanking conservatives based on freedom of speech. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=282.22s)]
*  Because the bankers wanted to kill CFPB because CFPB had stopped them from $20 billion worth [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=286.14s)]
*  of robberies. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=292.14s)]
*  That's literal. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=293.14s)]
*  They admitted it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=294.14s)]
*  They gave the money back. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=295.14s)]
*  They were robbing all of us, the average Americans, okay? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=296.46000000000004s)]
*  CFPB was the best cop on the beat on Wall Street. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=300.1s)]
*  And now here's Laura Loomer of all people going, wait a minute, they were against debanking. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=303.92s)]
*  You guys are lying. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=309.64s)]
*  Boom, there we go, okay? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=311.12s)]
*  So now people are beginning to realize, maybe Republican politicians, including Trump, might [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=314.12s)]
*  also be lying to you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=320.8s)]
*  To which I say, of course, of course. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=322.56s)]
*  So they got caught on this one. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=326.28s)]
*  They'll keep getting caught. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=327.8s)]
*  What effect it has? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=329.56s)]
*  There'd be a series of multi-trillion dollar robberies before people wake up and get angry [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=330.56s)]
*  enough to have political and electoral consequences. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=336.52s)]
*  So I knew the minute Trump got elected, we were gonna, trillions of dollars went out [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=340.68s)]
*  the door. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=346.28s)]
*  I knew the tax cuts were a giant robbery that was inevitable as soon as he got elected. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=347.28s)]
*  And then some sort of crypto robbery, the deregulation robberies, all these different [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=352.64s)]
*  sets of robberies are just gonna happen. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=356.76s)]
*  We're not gonna be able to stop it in time. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=359.08s)]
*  But what the Trump guys don't understand is, once enough, once you get past the tipping [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  point where enough of your own base realizes you screwed them, my guess is, knowing the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=365.76s)]
*  right wing, my guess is there's going to be a rage that you're not going to be able to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=371.76s)]
*  contain. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=375.84s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=376.92s)]
*  I don't wanna give Loomer too much credit because I would be more impressed if she went [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=378.28s)]
*  to bat for someone who had a different political ideology and they were debanked. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=383.44s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing now with Senate Republicans yesterday, those cries about debanking [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=389.28s)]
*  was really just for them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=395.6s)]
*  That's not surprising, right? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=397.16s)]
*  And you look at how they operated in December with HR 94, 95 that had that been successful, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=398.68s)]
*  could have given Trump's IRS the ability to unilaterally strip groups that they deem as [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=406.8s)]
*  terrorism supporters of their nonprofit status. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=413.56s)]
*  That to me is even more severe than one single person losing access to their bank account [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  from one single financial institution. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=422.20000000000005s)]
*  They don't seem to care if that group supports Palestinian rights or is critical of Israel. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=425.92s)]
*  They're totally fine across the board. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  The same day as the joint address when Trump declared he brought back free speech, earlier [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=434.92s)]
*  that day he said he wanted college students who protest illegally thrown in prison, whether [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  they're American citizens or foreign students. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=445.56s)]
*  There's no consistency there. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=448.64000000000004s)]
*  So this just seems like they're, hey, wink and nod, handshake deal. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=450.52s)]
*  You're not gonna debank our people, but it's open season on the left. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=455.0s)]
*  Yeah, don't debank anyone. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=460.08s)]
*  But look, I get it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=463.46s)]
*  If you criticize your own side, there's going to be a fury, trust me. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=464.76s)]
*  So that's why they're taking little baby steps in criticizing their own side, but only if [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  it affects them, to your point, Jordan, right? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  So if once I see them actually sticking up for all Americans like we're trying to do [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=478.64s)]
*  here, then I'll be more impressed. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=484.4s)]
*  But even so, challenging their own because it affects them, it's better than not challenging. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=486.3s)]
*  So I'll take it, and now a lot of right wingers are beginning to realize, these guys don't [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=493.94s)]
*  really care about us. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=499.96s)]
*  They care about themselves and their donors like all the other greasy politicians. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=501.3s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=505.84s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ3WWyry8c&t=508.79999999999995s)]
