TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# THE BIDENS WANT BACK IN
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0)
*  If we finally beat Medicare. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=0.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=5.68s)]
*  I think she's not qualified to be president. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=8.56s)]
*  And now I wanna hand it over to the president of Ukraine who has as much courage as he has [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=11.68s)]
*  determination. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=16.96s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=17.96s)]
*  Folks, imagine what we can do next. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=20.96s)]
*  Four more years. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=24.6s)]
*  As his term came to a close, it became more and more obvious that former President Joe [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=28.96s)]
*  Biden was not fit to be president of the United States, especially considering his mental [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=33.84s)]
*  decline. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=38.92s)]
*  But apparently the man is refusing to just retire because according to a new report by [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=39.92s)]
*  NBC News, the Biden's want back in. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=44.84s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=50.0s)]
*  The only rational reaction to that headline is please kill me. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=51.6s)]
*  Okay, so look. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=56.52s)]
*  The report states that Biden is offering to help the Democratic Party. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=58.2s)]
*  I mean, he could have helped the Democratic Party by not running for a second term, but [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  okay. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=68.12s)]
*  However, he wants to help in any way he possibly can, including but not limited to helping [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=69.12s)]
*  with fundraising and campaigning for other Democrats. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=73.84s)]
*  Now Biden has met with DNC Chair Ken Martin to offer up his assistance. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  Former First Lady Jill Biden, unsurprisingly, is also asking if there's anything she can [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=83.12s)]
*  do to help with things like fundraising, campaigning. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=88.04s)]
*  Now how would the voters feel about this? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=91.92s)]
*  We're gonna get to it in just a second, but initial thoughts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=94.68s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a reason why they're doing this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=97.56s)]
*  One is Dr. Jill Biden is almost as big an egomaniac as Joe Biden. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  And so she can't stand to be outside the game. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=106.72s)]
*  She's gotta be the center of attention. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=109.0s)]
*  She's the one who wanted to keep him in the race in the first place, even though she knew [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=110.76s)]
*  with absolute certainty that he had mental decline. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  I mean, look at the clips we just played you, but imagine that you live with Joe Biden. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=116.92s)]
*  She probably heard things like that thousands of times, knew that he was absolutely falling [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=120.56s)]
*  apart at the seams. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  And she's like, go back in, Joe, go back in. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm fine, we'll be fine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=130.4s)]
*  I mean, what she did to her husband was unconscionable, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=132.8s)]
*  So now she's like, not enough, I wanna go back and just retire, just retire, what's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=137.12s)]
*  wrong with you? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=141.4s)]
*  No, no, no, me, me, me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=142.4s)]
*  And now the second part is what I told you when Kamala Harris was talking about, I might [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=144.2s)]
*  run or I might run for governor, I might run for president. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=148.48s)]
*  And this is what I told you guys when Chelsea, after the Clintons left office at some point, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  it was talking to Chelsea Clinton running. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=157.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  This is all to increase the market value of the family. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  So they're about to write books, both Jill Biden and Joe Biden. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=163.56s)]
*  Who's gonna, God, please Democrats don't buy those books. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  What are you gonna learn in those books? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=170.32s)]
*  They're gonna buy the books. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=171.56s)]
*  And you think Joe Biden is actually writing the book? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=172.56s)]
*  Do you think Joe Biden is writing the book? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=175.0s)]
*  Sharp as a tack. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=177.64s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=178.64s)]
*  So they want the books to be worth more. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=180.28s)]
*  So they're like, no, no, no, we're still in the game. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=182.64s)]
*  We're still very powerful. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  And we've still got a lot of, so you should pay attention to us and pay us a lot of money [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=186.18s)]
*  for our books and speeches, etc. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  I would buy a new Biden book if the book was limited to corn pop like stories. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=193.16s)]
*  I would buy the Biden book if he actually wrote it, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=200.4s)]
*  because then it would be an amazing thing to read. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=203.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=206.56s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=207.08s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  But he's not gonna write it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=208.12s)]
*  No, he's not. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, if you're wondering where the hearts and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  minds of voters are in regard to the Biden's re-entering Democratic politics. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=213.0s)]
*  Well, CNN poll this month asked Democrats and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=218.68s)]
*  Democratic leaning independence, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  which leader best reflects the party's core values. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=223.8s)]
*  1% chose Biden. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=227.28s)]
*  I'm gonna give credit to Democratic voters here, because all my life, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=229.28s)]
*  Democratic voters, unfortunately, not all of them, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  obviously Bernie won a huge percentage, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=235.12s)]
*  But about 55% have been taught compliance and obedience. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  And so whenever a Democratic leader says something, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  they're like, of course, absolutely, you're the greatest person in the world. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=244.88s)]
*  I will do anything you want. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=248.84s)]
*  You are a demigod, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=250.4s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, all these frauds, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=253.0s)]
*  Pelosi, Schumer, etc. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=256.44s)]
*  But look, 99% of Democratic voters are like, thanks but no thanks, Joe. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=258.52s)]
*  So way to go, Democratic voters. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=262.76s)]
*  I know it's a little too late, but you woke up and you deserve credit for that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  So you're not listening to the nonsense garbage anymore about Joe Biden. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=269.32s)]
*  So that's good. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=272.79999999999995s)]
*  By the way, also the rest of Democratic leadership. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  Biden still thinks he would have won the 2024 election. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  Biden has no pangs of regret. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=280.24s)]
*  A person familiar with the private conversations said he remains defiant and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  believes Trump's victory shows the party did itself no favors by pushing him to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=286.68s)]
*  drop out of the race, the source said. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I thought unearned confidence was at record levels with George W. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=293.08s)]
*  Bush, but I was wrong. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=298.04s)]
*  It's at record levels with Biden. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=300.04s)]
*  I mean, delusional. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=302.36s)]
*  Even Michael LaRosa, who was Jill Biden's press secretary, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=304.2s)]
*  I interviewed him yesterday, check it out on YouTube. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=308.04s)]
*  Even he who's criticized them for gaslighting, etc. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=310.44s)]
*  And gotten in trouble in Washington for that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=316.44s)]
*  Even he was like, no, no, no, no, but they're not egomaniacs. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=320.04s)]
*  They're good people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=326.84s)]
*  Joe Biden's a really good person. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=327.52s)]
*  In Washington, the stuff we're saying is just considered outrageous. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=329.16s)]
*  Like you can criticize Joe Biden for staying in the race too long. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=334.6s)]
*  But you can't say that he's a narcissist egomaniac who chose. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=337.68s)]
*  And I asked LaRosa, I said, okay, so [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=341.88s)]
*  they gambled because he said they gambled that they might be able to pull off [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=344.52s)]
*  the victory against Trump even though, obviously, Biden's mental shape was not in, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  mental state was not in great shape. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=354.84s)]
*  He said, yeah, they gambled on it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=360.52s)]
*  They gambled the entire country and they say that democracy was on the line. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  They gambled democracy itself according to them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=366.52s)]
*  On the off chance that they could pull off a miracle win [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  when they were in the mid 30s and polling, which is near impossible to win. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=373.96s)]
*  And they knew that they knew it was near impossible. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=378.2s)]
*  But they're like, yeah, but me, I have to be president and she has to be in president. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=381.0s)]
*  So don't tell me anything about, so Trump's a gigantic out of control narcissist. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=388.52s)]
*  But so is Joe Biden and so is Jill Biden. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they don't care about us, Cenk, and they don't care about democracy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  The democracy thing for them was a storyline to run on, okay? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=401.08s)]
*  But if they really cared about it, they wouldn't engage in that coverup and they wouldn't have [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=405.32s)]
*  crowned Kamala Harris as the replacement to Joe Biden without having anyone in the electorate [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=410.12s)]
*  weigh in on it. By the way, speaking of Kamala Harris, let's talk about this because apparently, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=418.28s)]
*  a recent morning consult poll found that voters really do want to rally behind former Vice [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=423.56s)]
*  President Kamala Harris. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=430.04s)]
*  And I don't understand, I really don't understand it. So the 2024 Democratic nominee has the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=431.32s)]
*  support of 36% of Democratic voters and Democratic leaning independents eligible to participate in [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=437.0s)]
*  the 2028 primary. Following Harris is former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=443.16s)]
*  holds 10% support. No other candidate on the list achieved double digit support and 13% [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=449.16s)]
*  of possible primary voters remain undecided at this early point. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=455.32s)]
*  All right, so number one, these polls are not 1% reliable, because they're just testing name [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=459.88s)]
*  recognition, right? But number two, please Democratic voters that I just gave credit to, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=470.28s)]
*  wake up. It isn't just Joe Biden, they're all lying to you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=475.08s)]
*  Pick a populist who actually is honest and wants to deliver on those beautiful Democratic policies. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=478.68s)]
*  The economic ones that will make all of our lives better. Do not trust these frauds. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=485.0s)]
*  What did Kamala Harris do when it was her turn? 90 corporate CEOs are on my side, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=490.36s)]
*  Dick Cheney's on my side. I don't want any piece of that. You shouldn't want any piece of that. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=494.44s)]
*  Anyway, I bring you this because I was just stunned by it. I wrote a tweet saying these polls [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=498.28s)]
*  show Kamala Harris is the leading Democratic candidate are so stupid. She just has better [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=504.2s)]
*  name recognition. If you consider voting for her in a Democratic primary, you ought to have your [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=508.28s)]
*  head examined. Stop fawning over incompetent Democratic leaders. You're not surprised by that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=511.72s)]
*  post, right? But the reason I tell you that is because then Roland Martin wrote back in, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=516.12s)]
*  replied to me and said, such a BS tweet, when he wrote out the whole thing, 100% bull. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=520.52s)]
*  That's a compelling argument, Cenk. He really made his case. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=527.4s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Roland, you want Kamala Harris to run again? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=532.36s)]
*  She lost every swing state. She lost the popular vote. She couldn't finish a sentence. Well, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=537.08s)]
*  actually, the problem is she could finish too many sentences. They're just rambled and rambled and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=542.84s)]
*  rambled in which she ate at a word salad bar every single night, right? And you can't see that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  incompetence. Nope, nope, nope. Kamala Harris was on Roland Martin's side. Roland Martin was on [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=553.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris's side. So no, we go defend the Democratic establishment and identity politics [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  and all that garbage. Pick someone who's actually going to deliver for you. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=563.56s)]
*  Yeah, we just hope that a candidate like that exists and plans to run, but we're gonna have [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=568.4399999999999s)]
*  to wait and see. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdKoyePpP0&t=575.4s)]
