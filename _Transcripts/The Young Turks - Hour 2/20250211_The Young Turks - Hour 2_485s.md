"Are there too many ads and trailers before movies? Cinemagoers in Connecticut may see two start times for listed films ‚Äî one before commercials and one after ‚Äî if a lawmaker successfully gets a new bill passed.

State Senator Martin Looney of New Haven, Conn., proposed bill no. 797 on Jan. 21, in an effort to ‚Äúrequire that each movie advertisement or listing include, and separately list, the scheduled start time for (1) the movie trailers and advertisements that precede the advertised or listed movie, and (2) the advertised or listed movie.‚Äù*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

*  commercials and trailers and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=18.38s)]
*  it's like some trailers are [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  entertaining others not so much. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you're seeing the movie, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=23.26s)]
*  I've got other things to do. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=24.6s)]
*  Now, watch this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=25.68s)]
*  We come to this place for magic. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=30.64s)]
*  We come to AMC theaters to laugh, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=34.88s)]
*  to cry, to care, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=38.04s)]
*  because we need that, all of us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=39.88s)]
*  I hate that commercial. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  They play that commercial at AMC [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=47.04s)]
*  every single time I go to see [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=48.6s)]
*  a movie, right? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=49.72s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  I'm already at AMC. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  We're all already at AMC. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Why do we have to watch a commercial [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=56.44s)]
*  at AMC while we're at AMC? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=58.36s)]
*  I have an extra hatred for it [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=60.12s)]
*  because I don't like anything that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=61.76s)]
*  whispers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=63.8s)]
*  So which is- [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=64.84s)]
*  She's in the movie theater though. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=65.64s)]
*  Movies are magic. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=66.8s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=68.24s)]
*  But they are. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=69.8s)]
*  We need to whisper in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=70.36s)]
*  the movie theater. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=71.32s)]
*  You don't have to whisper, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=72.08s)]
*  you're on the screen. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=73.32s)]
*  Look, we got a poll for [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=74.6s)]
*  you guys live chat. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=75.64s)]
*  You guys all know it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=76.68s)]
*  What time should the be advertised [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=77.88s)]
*  as the start of the movie when all [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=80.68s)]
*  the ads and trailers start, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=83.0s)]
*  when the trailer start or [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=84.84s)]
*  when the actual movie starts? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=86.48s)]
*  Curious what you guys think about [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=88.28s)]
*  that because I got a surprising [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=89.44s)]
*  answer for that, but go. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=90.6s)]
*  So this state senator, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=91.84s)]
*  Martin Looney, wants full [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=93.84s)]
*  disclosure about when the movie [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=96.2s)]
*  actually starts and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=98.84s)]
*  when the trailers start. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=100.36s)]
*  So moviegoers can have the option [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=101.92s)]
*  of showing up early enough to watch [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=104.32s)]
*  all the trailers and commercials, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=106.76s)]
*  or you can show up just as [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=109.12s)]
*  the movie is starting. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=110.72s)]
*  So Looney introduced this bill last [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=112.2s)]
*  month to try to get the theaters to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=114.4s)]
*  start times for a film, again, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=117.08s)]
*  one for when the trailers begin and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=119.08s)]
*  one when the actual movie begins. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=121.16s)]
*  He says the following, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=123.32s)]
*  it seems to be an abuse of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=124.72s)]
*  people's time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=126.24s)]
*  If they want to get there early and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=128.0s)]
*  watch the promos, they can. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=129.84s)]
*  But if they just want to see [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=131.64s)]
*  the feature, they ought to be able [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  to get there just in time for that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=135.84s)]
*  He's really looking out for [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  the American people here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=140.04s)]
*  He wants to make sure that the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=140.88s)]
*  people of Connecticut, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=142.44s)]
*  because he's a state senator, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  have the option of saving a little [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=145.28s)]
*  bit of time and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=146.84s)]
*  not watching trailers if they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=147.4s)]
*  don't want to. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=148.52s)]
*  A, this Looney guy's a bit of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  an American hero. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  B, I like the tune that he's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=151.84s)]
*  singing, think about it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=153.88s)]
*  And C, I like that someone's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=156.0s)]
*  actually doing something that their [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  voters care about. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  He's doing something that he cares [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=163.4s)]
*  about, let's keep it real. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=164.6s)]
*  I know, but I bet you tons of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=165.72s)]
*  people resonate with that more than [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  they do on lead poisoning in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=169.72s)]
*  the water. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=171.72s)]
*  So it definitely- [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=172.76s)]
*  Even though I want them to care [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=173.36s)]
*  about lead poisoning in the water. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=174.68s)]
*  No, I hear you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  And look, it resonated with me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=176.52s)]
*  I mean, this is a state story, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  right, who cares? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=180.16s)]
*  Except it spoke to me, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  it spoke to a frustration that I [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=183.4s)]
*  myself feel when I go see a film. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  Told you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=187.08s)]
*  And I just want to get there and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=187.6s)]
*  watch the film and go home, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  I have other things to do. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=191.12s)]
*  So watching a bunch of commercials [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=192.08s)]
*  and trailers is not necessarily [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  what I'm into. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=194.8s)]
*  However- [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=195.4s)]
*  I disagree with that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  I want to give you the other side [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=196.72s)]
*  of this because the other side is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=197.84s)]
*  relevant. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Look, the theater industry, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  the movie theater industry has been [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=202.08s)]
*  struggling and hasn't recovered [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=203.68s)]
*  since the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=205.72s)]
*  And so the idea that you have two [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=208.36s)]
*  different start times is going to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  turn advertisers off, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=213.4s)]
*  Because advertisers know that most [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  people are not going to show up in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  time to watch ads. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  And so it's going to make it [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=223.28s)]
*  difficult for these theaters to get [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=224.68s)]
*  advertisers, which means making [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=226.56s)]
*  money and staying afloat is going to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=228.44s)]
*  be difficult for movie theaters. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=230.56s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=233.56s)]
*  There was a period of time in my [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=234.44s)]
*  life where I kind of poopooed on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=235.88s)]
*  movie theaters. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=237.28s)]
*  I wasn't into movie theaters. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=238.12s)]
*  I like watching movies at home. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=239.36s)]
*  I could pause, take a break, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=240.6s)]
*  eat something, not have to pay an [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=242.12s)]
*  arm and a leg at the concession [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=243.68s)]
*  stand. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=245.08s)]
*  However, lately I've been enjoying [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=246.12s)]
*  going to see a movie. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=248.0s)]
*  It's like a nice cozy night with [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=249.36s)]
*  my husband. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=251.08s)]
*  And I don't want the theaters to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=251.84s)]
*  shut down. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=253.52s)]
*  So when it comes to the ads and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=254.24s)]
*  the lack of disclosure when the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=256.56s)]
*  feature film actually starts, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=259.12s)]
*  I will allow it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=262.56s)]
*  I will allow it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=263.88s)]
*  That's where I'm at. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=264.88s)]
*  So John Weber, a YouTube member, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=265.72s)]
*  made an interesting point. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=267.48s)]
*  He said, in Germany, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=268.52s)]
*  the trailers ran 45 minutes- [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=269.8s)]
*  No. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=271.36s)]
*  When I saw a movie in 1994. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=271.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=273.92s)]
*  I will not allow it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=274.44s)]
*  The Germans love to overdo things. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=275.72s)]
*  So bring it down, 45 minutes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=278.8s)]
*  Jesus, Lord, mercy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=281.2s)]

*  Look, I like that the movies start [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  later than their advertised time [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=294.76s)]
*  because I'm a guy, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=296.64s)]
*  which Anna Kenatesu and everybody [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=297.76s)]
*  in the building Kenatesu, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=299.68s)]
*  I'm always late, right? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=301.32s)]
*  And my God, so I used, almost [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=303.0s)]
*  everyone I date or now my wife, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  they also love being late. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=308.52s)]
*  My ex-girlfriend was from Jamaica. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  She ran on Jamaican time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  We weren't going to make it in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=316.84s)]
*  a German movie on time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=318.32s)]
*  Okay, so I like that it gives [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=319.88s)]
*  a little bit of fake cushion. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=322.28s)]
*  So I try to get to the actual start [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=325.36s)]
*  time, which I know is not [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=327.52s)]
*  the actual start time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=329.0s)]
*  So either I make it barely by the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=330.52s)]
*  beginning of the trailers or [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=332.4s)]
*  on a bad day, barely by the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  beginning of the movie. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=335.68s)]
*  So I like the cushion, okay? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=337.2s)]
*  Now having said that, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=338.92s)]
*  I'm going to vote B in the poll. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=340.08s)]
*  Because look, I get that the movie [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=341.76s)]
*  theaters want and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=343.84s)]
*  need the ads for themselves, etc. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=344.8s)]
*  But that should be kind of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=346.92s)]
*  optional. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=348.2s)]
*  You get there a little bit early, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  watch the ads. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=350.44000000000005s)]
*  I remember when I was a kid, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  they would have the ads but [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  before the start time, right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=353.6s)]
*  The start time was for [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=355.8s)]
*  the trailers. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=356.92s)]
*  And trailers, watching trailers is [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  one of the most all American things [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=359.92s)]
*  you could do. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I don't mind the trailers as [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  much unless- [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=363.8s)]
*  Mind, I love the trailers. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=364.76000000000005s)]
*  I think the trailers are almost [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=366.6s)]
*  better than the movie. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=367.76000000000005s)]
*  Depends though. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=368.56s)]
*  So one of the more recent films I [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=369.6s)]
*  went to go see in the theater was [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  Wild Robot, which was excellent. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=374.12s)]
*  It was an excellent film, but [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=376.36s)]
*  it's a kids movie, right? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=378.44s)]
*  Although it's one of those kids [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=380.23999999999995s)]
*  movies that's also entertaining for [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=381.56s)]
*  adults. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  Anyway, all the trailers were for [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=383.67999999999995s)]
*  kids movies. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=386.11999999999995s)]
*  And I wanted to do self harm, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  I couldn't take it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, I've probably seen 80% of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  those movies. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=393.2s)]
*  That's why I don't have kids, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=394.2s)]
*  I would not be happy with that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=395.32s)]
*  But based on your suggestion, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  by the way, I took my kids to that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=398.2s)]
*  Wild Robot. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=399.64s)]
*  How good was that movie? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=400.44s)]
*  It was good. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  So you were right. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=402.08s)]
*  The American people have spoken. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  It made me cry. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  But for me, I cry in every movie, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=406.68s)]
*  so it doesn't really matter. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=408.92s)]
*  My, I wish you hadn't said that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=411.32000000000005s)]
*  Wait till Jesse Waters gets a load [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=412.76000000000005s)]
*  of that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  Real men don't cry. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=416.76000000000005s)]
*  But anyway, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=421.6s)]
*  we'll see where this goes. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=422.24s)]
*  So one theater owner said, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  this is kind of a strange bill. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  We, as an independent movie house, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=427.56s)]
*  are financially dependent on our [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=429.36s)]
*  previews as well as our overall [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  messaging, including commercials. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=432.92s)]
*  Announcing the start time of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  the actual movie would definitely [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=436.68s)]
*  disincentivize our business [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=438.32s)]
*  partners' video messaging, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=439.8s)]
*  which would have a direct negative [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=441.32s)]
*  impact on our financial stability [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=443.12s)]
*  in an already so [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG20v5auNrM&t=444.84000000000003s)]
