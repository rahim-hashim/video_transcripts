"CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten broke down the ‚Äúworst day of polling‚Äù of Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency on Thursday, highlighting four new surveys showing his approval rating sinking.

Four new polls from CNN, Gallup, Ipsos, and Quinnipiac this week show Trump with a negative net approval rating, causing Enten to declare that the president‚Äôs approval is ‚Äúunderwater like The Little Mermaid.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs overall approval rating was below 50% in each poll, with him grabbing 47%, 45%, 44%, and 45%, respectively."

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump's Approval Rating Takes A NOSEDIVE
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc)
*  Negative, negative, negative, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=0.0s)]
*  negative, underwater, underwater, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=2.1s)]
*  underwater, underwater. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=4.42s)]
*  These four polls, all of them tell [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=5.8s)]
*  a consistent story, and that is [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Trump is on the negative side of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=9.3s)]
*  the ledger. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=10.84s)]
*  His net approval is negative. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=11.52s)]
*  He is underwater like [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  the Little Mermaid. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=14.72s)]
*  The honeymoon appears to be over [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=16.88s)]
*  for Donald Trump who just a few [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  weeks ago had a pretty high [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=20.84s)]
*  approval rating relative to his [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=22.46s)]
*  previous approval ratings. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=24.54s)]
*  But now, Harry Enton on CNN broke [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=26.22s)]
*  down Trump's worst day of polling [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=28.92s)]
*  in his second term. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=31.32s)]
*  So according to four new polls from [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  CNN, Gallup, Ipsos, and Quinnipiac, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump had a negative net approval [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=39.64s)]
*  rating in all four polls. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=42.28s)]
*  So Trump's overall approval rating [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=44.24s)]
*  was below 50% in each poll, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=47.08s)]
*  with him grabbing 47%, 45%, 44%, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=49.44s)]
*  and 45% respectively. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=52.72s)]
*  Now let's hear a little bit about [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=55.0s)]
*  what Harry Enton had to say about [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  the polls and how they compare to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=59.76s)]
*  what the poll said last month. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=61.92s)]
*  All right, so we don't have a CNN [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=64.08s)]
*  poll to compare, but we do have [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=65.88s)]
*  the other three pollsters that we [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=67.64s)]
*  can look at. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=69.44s)]
*  Trump's net approval rating, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  the change since January. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=71.6s)]
*  Look at this, Gallup, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=73.0s)]
*  down five points, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=74.44s)]
*  Quinnipiac, down seven points. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=75.7s)]
*  Ipsos, down 13 points. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=77.88s)]
*  They polled right at the beginning [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=79.16s)]
*  of his presidency, so [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=81.0s)]
*  not a big surprise that that shows [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=82.28s)]
*  the worst change for Donald Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=84.2s)]
*  But the bottom line is this, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  across the four new polls that we [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=87.72s)]
*  have, all of them have Trump and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=89.27999999999999s)]
*  net negative approval rating, and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  the three in which we have a trend [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  line, we see Donald Trump heading [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=94.08s)]
*  in the wrong direction, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  swimming upstream, you might say. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=97.0s)]
*  So I'm going to go to one more clip [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=100.72s)]
*  before I hear your thoughts, Cenk, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  because the real question is, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=104.72s)]
*  where is he losing support [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  specifically? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=108.24s)]
*  Because remember, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump did manage to increase [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  his support among groups of people [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=113.16s)]
*  who typically would vote for [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=115.44s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=117.16s)]
*  He also increased his support [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=117.84s)]
*  during this past election among [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  independents. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  That is a fragile coalition, and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  it appears that that fragility is [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=124.16s)]
*  now hurting him. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=126.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=128.28s)]
*  One of Donald Trump's great [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=129.92s)]
*  strengths during his first term, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=131.44s)]
*  one of Donald Trump's great [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=133.4s)]
*  strengths during the 2024 campaign [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=135.12s)]
*  was the economy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=137.36s)]
*  The idea that Donald Trump could [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=138.96s)]
*  fix the economy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=140.44s)]
*  This was one of Donald Trump's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=141.48s)]
*  great strengths. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=142.92s)]
*  Now it's one of his great [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=143.88s)]
*  weaknesses. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=145.08s)]
*  What am I talking about? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=145.72s)]
*  Trump's net approval rating, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=146.88s)]
*  you go back to his first term, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=148.32s)]
*  February 2017, Ipsos, he was at plus [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=149.8s)]
*  16 points on his net approval. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=151.68s)]
*  Quinnipiac plus six, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=153.88s)]
*  look at where he is now in Ipsos. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=155.08s)]
*  He's eight points underwater on [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=157.08s)]
*  the economy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=158.56s)]
*  Quinnipiac, four points on [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=159.36s)]
*  the economy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=161.04s)]
*  I honestly never thought I'd see [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=162.24s)]
*  the day in which Donald Trump would [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=163.96s)]
*  be polling so poor on the economy, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=165.76s)]
*  but that day is here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=167.68s)]
*  As I said last week, inflation ate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=169.28s)]
*  the Joe Biden presidency alive and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=171.4s)]
*  right now it is very much the case [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=173.6s)]
*  that Donald Trump is in danger of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  inflation eating his presidency [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=177.44s)]
*  alive because his net approval [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  ratings on the economy are underwater. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=181.44s)]
*  So I'm curious what you think about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=184.0s)]
*  this, Cenk, is this just a blip in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=186.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's second term or [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=188.12s)]
*  do you think that this trend is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=189.88s)]
*  going to continue? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=191.64s)]
*  Yes, I have a very strong feeling [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=192.76s)]
*  about that in a sec, but first, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=194.28s)]
*  I'm curious about what you guys [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=195.72s)]
*  think, so is Donald Trump going to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=197.12s)]
*  recover from these bad poll numbers? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=198.76s)]
*  We're asking that in the live chat [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=200.64s)]
*  on YouTube, check out the show live [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=202.48s)]
*  Monday through Friday, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=204.4s)]
*  6 to 8 o'clock Eastern, so [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=205.68s)]
*  you can participate in the show. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=207.16s)]
*  We also read your comments too, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=209.4s)]
*  if you remember. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=210.52s)]
*  All right, so first thing I have to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=211.16s)]
*  say is Harry Antin, fun guy, okay? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=213.72s)]
*  So normally you see me criticizing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=217.24s)]
*  mainstream media figures. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=218.8s)]
*  You used to criticize Harry Antin [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=219.88s)]
*  pretty viciously. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=221.4s)]
*  And I used to go after Harry Antin [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=222.28s)]
*  when he was working with [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=223.68s)]
*  Nate Silver and I thought that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=224.68s)]
*  they were so biased. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=226.12s)]
*  And they would constantly say, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=227.84s)]
*  no matter how much the establishment [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=229.52s)]
*  Democrat was losing, they're like, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=231.4s)]
*  no, he'll eventually win. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=233.44s)]
*  Because we took 28 polls and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=234.96s)]
*  reverse them and blah, blah, blah. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  You're correct about that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that Silver was a bad [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=240.24s)]
*  influence on him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=241.72s)]
*  Now that he's over at CNN, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=242.84s)]
*  he does a really good job by [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=244.56s)]
*  breaking down polling objectively. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  No, but Silver got better too. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  Did he? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=250.08s)]
*  Well, no, no, in this election, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  he was one of the rare voices who [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  was saying, look guys, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=253.96s)]
*  the numbers are not complicated. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=255.32s)]
*  Biden's in a disastrous shape. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=257.36s)]
*  Okay, fair. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=259.04s)]
*  So he did a good job there and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=259.64s)]
*  it was objective and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=260.92s)]
*  he took a lot of heat for it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=261.8s)]
*  And so Antin is kind of entertaining, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=263.2s)]
*  but most importantly, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=265.64s)]
*  he's objective. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=268.24s)]
*  He's just like, I was going to say [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=268.74s)]
*  like we do, but really what anyone [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=270.92s)]
*  should do, just report the freaking [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=273.12s)]
*  numbers. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=275.32s)]
*  If they're positive for [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=275.92s)]
*  the Democrats, great. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=276.92s)]
*  If they're negative for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=277.8s)]
*  the Democrats, great. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=278.52s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=279.28s)]
*  That's not the point. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=279.92s)]
*  Your point is to actually show what [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=280.68s)]
*  Americans think, not what you think. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=283.0s)]
*  And in mainstream media, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=285.68s)]
*  they almost never do that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=287.32s)]
*  They always go, and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=289.6s)]
*  the American people think that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  there should be more taxes for [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  the rich. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  I'm like, when, how? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  Show me the freaking poll that says [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=295.92s)]
*  that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=297.44s)]
*  They don't say that at all. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=297.94s)]
*  So Harry's actually doing a good [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=299.04s)]
*  job of showing the numbers when [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  Trump is up and when Trump is down. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  By the way, as you look at these [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=304.48s)]
*  numbers, they look bad and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  they are getting worse for sure [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=308.36s)]
*  that all those numbers are correct. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  But the underlying numbers are still [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  relative to his first term, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  not so bad for Trump. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=317.0s)]
*  So even though he's under water, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  now those polls were at 47, 45, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=320.56s)]
*  44, and 45, those are higher than [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  Biden's numbers, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=324.74s)]
*  like 10 points higher oftentimes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=325.94s)]
*  But they're also higher than when [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=328.36s)]
*  Trump was in office the first time [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=330.48s)]
*  around, his first term. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=332.6s)]
*  So he came in with a significant [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=334.04s)]
*  bump this time around. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  Remember, he won the popular vote [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=337.92s)]
*  and what Americans do, and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=339.88s)]
*  this is what I love, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  this really open-minded of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=342.56s)]
*  American voters. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=344.24s)]
*  When a new president comes in, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  their popularity rating is always [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=347.52s)]
*  higher because it's American people [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=349.32s)]
*  being optimistic and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=351.16s)]
*  giving them a fair chance. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=352.2s)]
*  And saying, all right, you won [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  whether I voted for you or not. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=355.24s)]
*  Let's see what you got, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=356.76s)]
*  So Trump is benefiting from that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=358.12s)]
*  So even when he drops, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=359.64s)]
*  the numbers are not disastrous. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=360.84s)]
*  They're just kind of bad, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=362.56s)]
*  not disastrous. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=364.12s)]
*  Okay, so why are they dropping? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=364.96s)]
*  Obviously, the economy, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=366.4s)]
*  And look, guys, this is, so [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=368.68s)]
*  what I told Democrats during [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=370.12s)]
*  the elections is just because you [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=371.72s)]
*  think Joe Biden is young and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=373.6s)]
*  dynamic doesn't mean all [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=375.2s)]
*  the voters think he's young and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=376.76s)]
*  dynamic. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=378.56s)]
*  The rest of the voters have eyes [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=379.24s)]
*  and ears, right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=380.68s)]
*  So now I'm telling MAGA and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  the Republicans, just because you [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=383.8s)]
*  think it's great to do extreme cuts [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=386.2s)]
*  through Doge and chop away at all [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=388.48s)]
*  foreign aid, fire all the new [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=390.76s)]
*  people that are federal employees [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  and get rid of cancer research and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=394.64s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, all these things. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't mean that the middle [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  of the country agrees with that and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  wants that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  Like both sides make the mistake of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=403.32s)]
*  thinking that the extremes [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=405.6s)]
*  represent everyone that voted for [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=407.6s)]
*  Trump or everyone that voted for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  Biden. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=412.32000000000005s)]
*  That is why cutting off an entire [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  group of people in the country [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=414.68s)]
*  based on how they vote is a really [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=416.44s)]
*  bad idea because it leads to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=418.48s)]
*  increased misunderstanding, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=420.24s)]
*  You should know what people are [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  actually thinking. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  So now finally to the heart of your [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=426.04s)]
*  question, Ana, so are they going to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=428.16s)]
*  go back up or not? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, so I'm not shy about this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=432.0s)]
*  I wrote with about two or three [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=435.24s)]
*  years left on his term for [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  George W Bush like a million years [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=438.08s)]
*  ago, I wrote this op-ed that at [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  the time was considered controversial. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=441.68s)]
*  So no, he's never going to recover. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=444.16s)]
*  The numbers will only go down from [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=445.8s)]
*  here on out because he doesn't have [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=447.56s)]
*  the capacity to recover. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=449.36s)]
*  He's not smart enough. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=451.0s)]
*  He doesn't work hard enough. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  His policies aren't popular. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  There's nothing he [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=455.44s)]
*  represents that is popular. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=456.68s)]
*  That's so unfair. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=458.32s)]
*  He read like three camus. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=459.24s)]
*  And a Shakespeare. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  And a Shakespeare, that's right. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=461.52s)]
*  Okay, and as it turned out, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  I was right about that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=463.6s)]
*  And his numbers only went down, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=464.88s)]
*  never went back up. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=466.24s)]
*  With Trump, he's a mixed bag, guys. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=467.36s)]
*  So does he have wild, crazy [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=469.8s)]
*  tendencies? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=472.68s)]
*  Absolutely, dangerous tendencies. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=474.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=475.8s)]
*  If he starts to head down as he is [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=476.88s)]
*  now, and he digs in, and he just [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=479.12s)]
*  keeps digging and digging and [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=481.4s)]
*  digging, I am going to be king. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=483.2s)]
*  Yeah, I am like Napoleon. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=484.8s)]
*  I don't have to follow the court. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=486.32s)]
*  Then it's going to be an epic [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=487.76s)]
*  disaster. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=488.96s)]
*  And he's going to slide so far down [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=489.88s)]
*  he's going to get into the 20s. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=492.0s)]
*  Okay, that's if, if. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=493.64000000000004s)]

*  super tough on Trump, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=503.12s)]
*  he's a potential madman who could [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=504.52000000000004s)]
*  go in an authoritarian direction. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=506.6s)]
*  He also cares about being popular. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=509.44s)]
*  The rest of the politicians are [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=512.36s)]
*  like, popular? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=513.6s)]

*  So I'll turn around. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=528.64s)]
*  And he keeps testing things, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=530.24s)]
*  testing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=531.88s)]
*  All right, I'm going to be king. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=532.52s)]
*  No, you guys don't like that? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=534.12s)]
*  All right, forget it, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=535.24s)]
*  I'm not king, okay? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=535.88s)]

*  massive, weird, radical cuts, right? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=545.96s)]
*  They voted to bring prices down. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=549.12s)]
*  That was the number one issue. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=551.64s)]
*  Immigration was number two and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=553.28s)]
*  it was a strong number two. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=554.56s)]
*  But prices was a clear number one. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=556.12s)]
*  And now not only are you not [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=558.4s)]
*  bringing prices down, but [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=559.8s)]

*  points in the Ipsos Bowl. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=567.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=569.48s)]
*  Well, we'll see what happens. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=570.92s)]
*  Obviously, we're going to pay close [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=571.96s)]
*  attention to the story as [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhctStZrOc&t=573.36s)]
