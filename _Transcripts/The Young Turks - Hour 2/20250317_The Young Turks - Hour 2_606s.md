# Chuck Schumer SCARED of Protests, Cancels Book Tour
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ)
*  Chuck Schumer just bailed on his book tour, which was set to launch this week over, quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  security concerns. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=5.24s)]
*  The Senate majority leader had tour stops planned for Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and New York [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=6.8s)]
*  City this week, but all three are now scrapped due to organizers planning to protest at each [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=12.08s)]
*  stop. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=18.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=19.32s)]
*  Schumer, promoting his new book, Anti-Semitism in America, a warning, faced backlash over [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=20.32s)]
*  voting for the House approved government funding bill that averted a shutdown on Friday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=27.04s)]
*  With Democrats help, the Senate passed the stopgap bill hours before funding was set [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=32.56s)]
*  to lapse. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  A spokesperson for Schumer's book tour told ABC News that, quote, due to security concerns, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Senator Schumer's book events are being rescheduled. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  One of the groups organizing the protests was Jewish Voice for Peace, and it should [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=49.4s)]
*  be noted that there was no evidence, nothing reported, no indication whatsoever, that any [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=53.76s)]
*  of these protests included any component that would have put Chuck Schumer or attendees [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=61.739999999999995s)]
*  in any danger whatsoever. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=69.14s)]
*  It would have most likely just been a mild inconvenience and perhaps a disruption. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=71.72s)]
*  But Schumer may draw even more ire from Democrats after his appearance on the New York Times [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=78.96s)]
*  The Interview podcast on which he appeared this Sunday. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=84.0s)]
*  His comments on the state of the Democratic Party are sure to ruffle feathers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=88.0s)]
*  Schumer claimed the Democrats are authentic and have, quote, real direction now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  He added that Democrats, known as the Party for Working People, did not publicly voice [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  how they were fighting for the working class in recent years to their detriment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=103.16s)]
*  According to Schumer, that's no longer the case. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  When asked by the host, Lulu Garcia Navarro, whether it's time for Schumer to retire, Schumer [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=110.84s)]
*  dodged the question. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Instead, he claimed that the party's members are all united in their front against President [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=119.04s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=124.86s)]
*  Now I'm wondering, is there something that I'm missing here? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=128.2s)]
*  So he again is saying, yes, they're united, they're taking on Trump, we have the strong [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=134.48s)]
*  opposition, like we talked about in the last story. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=139.2s)]
*  I'm not seeing it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=141.6s)]
*  But also these comments about having a real direction now and the Democrats are finally [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  gonna start talking about the working class that they haven't in recent years. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=147.76s)]
*  It seems like they say this after every election cycle. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=154.12s)]
*  Why should we trust them this time? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=158.04s)]
*  We shouldn't. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=160.4s)]
*  There's just absolutely no proof that the actual owners of the party, the stewards of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=161.4s)]
*  the party, the Schumers, the Hawk Jeffries, all of these other folks that actually run [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=169.88s)]
*  the apparatus is the new DNC leader, who's a clown as well. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=176.88s)]
*  There's absolutely no indication that these guys aren't completely, completely instruments [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=183.28s)]
*  of capital and the business interests in our country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=190.24s)]
*  I mean, Hakeem Jeffries, the only thing this guy has ever been useful for is fundraising [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=194.64s)]
*  from these very same moneyed interests. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=201.0s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, who people derisively call the Senator from Wall Street, he's another [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=204.52s)]
*  one of these guys who is absolutely obsessed with the business interests and Gill and Brand, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=211.44s)]
*  no different, both of the New York senators. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=217.6s)]
*  I'm not surprised that he's like, we gotta pay lip service to this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=220.4s)]
*  We haven't paid enough lip service, not that we haven't actually gone out and done anything [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=225.36s)]
*  for normal everyday working people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=231.24s)]
*  He thinks the problem is they haven't spoken up enough. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=233.24s)]
*  They haven't been on the press lying to the working class about how much they're fighting [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=237.96s)]
*  for them enough. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=242.84s)]
*  And that's all he's talking about. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=243.84s)]
*  And like, listeners know, I'm a born and raised New Yorker. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=245.4s)]
*  Chuck Schumer has basically been the Senator from New York since I can remember. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=250.12s)]
*  This is the 90s we're talking about. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=255.68s)]
*  It's 2025, guys. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=257.44s)]
*  This dude is ancient. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=260.12s)]
*  He's a walking corpse. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=262.6s)]
*  He's clearly got no political instincts whatsoever. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=264.52s)]
*  His only true constituency are those Wall Street people. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=269.84s)]
*  And yeah, it's obviously time for him to go. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=275.08s)]
*  I don't think a single Democrat would lose a wink of sleep because Chuck Schumer is no [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=277.4s)]
*  longer the Senate minority leader. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=283.4s)]
*  That guy's the worst. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=285.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's rich hearing career politicians or people who have been in Congress for decades [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  talk about the new direction that Democrats are going to take. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  And like, especially when it comes to, you know, working class issues, you had an opportunity [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  to show that you cared about that in both the 2016 and the 2020 cycles. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=307.92s)]
*  And what did you all do? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=313.12s)]
*  You conspired to block the candidacy and thwart the candidacy of the most effective [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=314.8s)]
*  messenger the Democratic Party has ever had in the past probably 50 years on that issue [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=321.16s)]
*  specifically. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  Bernie Sanders had a base made up of the groups of people that you are losing to Trump and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  key groups of people that you need going forward to win elections. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  And you showed them how little you care about these issues. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=342.92s)]
*  So it's not just that they're going to start talking about these issues. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=346.88s)]
*  Why should anybody even believe you? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=350.8s)]
*  Like you talked about in the last story was you've got a King Jeffries going and kissing [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=353.8s)]
*  the butts of people in Silicon Valley, which who are some of the biggest donors for the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=357.90000000000003s)]
*  Democratic Party and shape the direction of Democratic Party policies. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=362.92s)]
*  You've seen these same people work to block any sort of state legislation that could give [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=368.08s)]
*  gig worker gig workers employee status so they would qualify for benefits. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  No, these people worked hand in hand with Democrats to stop that from happening. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=381.8s)]
*  So working people would continue to be exploited by these tech companies. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=386.97999999999996s)]
*  We've got the audio of Chuck Schumer dodging that question. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  Let's listen to it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=396.2s)]
*  I think we have mutual respect in our caucus. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=397.5s)]
*  And we are all united, no matter how people voted on this vote, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=401.86s)]
*  to continue fighting Trump. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=406.18s)]
*  We are a united and strong caucus fighting against Trump. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=408.46000000000004s)]
*  We disagreed on this issue, but that doesn't diminish in any way how we're going to fight [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=412.74s)]
*  every step of the way against Trump. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=418.46000000000004s)]
*  And I believe that we're going to have some real successes. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=420.74s)]
*  As a reminder, the question was, is it time for you to retire? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=424.46s)]
*  God, what are we doing here? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=429.14s)]
*  Yeah, and Chuck Schumer whose glasses are perpetually on the tip of his nose every time [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=432.41999999999996s)]
*  he shows up in public. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=440.46s)]
*  No, no, definitely not time. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=442.78s)]
*  He's as energized as ever. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=444.78s)]
*  And listen, another thing, the sort of subtext of the New York Times of all places, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=447.54s)]
*  like asking Chuck Schumer to his face if he's too old to be up to the task of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=455.14s)]
*  leaning the Democratic Party forward. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=460.94s)]
*  That should give you an indication. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=464.26s)]
*  They know what their readers are saying. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=466.46s)]
*  They know how their readers are responding. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=468.86s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=472.74s)]
*  The New York Times tends to be a place that walks in lockstep with the Democratic Party [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=473.82s)]
*  establishment. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=478.73999999999995s)]
*  Those are their guys, okay? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=480.41999999999996s)]
*  So for you to go on a New York Times podcast on a Sunday after you have been getting dragged [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  through the coals for basically laying down and being just a freaking punk to the Trump [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=489.73999999999995s)]
*  administration, that's crazy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=497.41999999999996s)]
*  And the last thing I'll say about the money and the Democrats, here's the thing. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=499.42s)]
*  The Democrats want to marry elite tastes, elite cultural affinities with the same old [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=505.14000000000004s)]
*  status quo in terms of the working class versus the ultra rich and who all of the benefits [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=514.22s)]
*  of the government accrues to. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=520.78s)]
*  Trump is like, no, we're gonna keep the status quo, but culturally the elites are out of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=523.5s)]
*  their minds. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=528.34s)]
*  We're actually gonna deliver on that for you guys. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=529.38s)]
*  The Democrats can't deliver on either freaking side of it cuz they're getting killed on abortion [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=533.14s)]
*  in state after state. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=539.3000000000001s)]
*  And all kinds of a litany of issues that they're capitulating on immigration. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=540.9s)]
*  They're capitulating on all, so you're not even delivering on a thing that you pretend [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=546.3000000000001s)]
*  to matter to you the most, which is sort of these cultural issues. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=551.3000000000001s)]
*  And meanwhile, Donald Trump and these guys get to pretend to be hard hat wearing flannel [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=557.14s)]
*  wearing lumberjacks while obviously catering to the very same rich moneyed interests as [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=562.8199999999999s)]
*  always. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=572.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=573.6999999999999s)]
*  This whole thing is frustrating. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=576.86s)]
*  He clearly isn't inspiring a lot of faith or confidence from his colleagues. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=578.58s)]
*  We're seeing House Democrats take shots at him. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=584.7s)]
*  It seems like the gloves are coming off. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=588.82s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=590.5s)]
*  We'll see how long he remains in that position. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=591.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=593.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if anyone's gonna be brave enough to really suggest that he step down or call [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=594.4200000000001s)]
*  for his removal, but time will tell. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=597.82s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=600.1400000000001s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU1vjK0SYEQ&t=603.1s)]
