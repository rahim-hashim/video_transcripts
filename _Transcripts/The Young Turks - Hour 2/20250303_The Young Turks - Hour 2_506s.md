"President Donald Trump is ordering military aid to Ukraine to be paused after his Friday Oval Office argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a White House official told CNN Monday.

‚ÄúThe president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,‚Äù the White House official said."*

# BREAKING: Trump Suspends ALL Military Aid To Ukraine
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU)
*  The Trump administration has decided to pause all military aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=0.0s)]
*  following the disastrous Oval Office conflict between Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Vladimir [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=6.72s)]
*  Zelensky, the President of Ukraine. Now, Fox News is reporting that the Trump administration [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=14.24s)]
*  is pausing all aid to Ukraine, including weapons in transit or in Poland. And the pause comes days [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=19.6s)]
*  after that contentious meeting with Zelensky in the Oval Office. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=27.12s)]
*  Now, this decision was made after a meeting that took place between Donald Trump, JD Vance, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=30.96s)]
*  Marco Rubio, and others within the Pentagon. And so this is now, I mean, honestly, it's not surprising [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=39.36s)]
*  given everything that transpired in the Oval Office. And since then, today, the AP had a headline [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=49.84s)]
*  titled Ukraine Zelensky says end of war with Russia is very, very far away. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=57.04s)]
*  And that led to Trump absolutely losing it. We'll get to Trump's statement in just a minute. But [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=62.72s)]
*  I wanna give you the full quote from Zelensky. Here's what he said. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=67.68s)]
*  We are talking about the first steps today and therefore until they are on paper, I would not [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=71.44s)]
*  like to talk about them in great detail. He's talking about a possible peace agreement. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=77.12s)]
*  He also says an agreement to end the war is still very, very far away and no one has started all [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  these steps yet. The peace that we foresee in the future must be just, honest, and most importantly, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=89.2s)]
*  sustainable. Trump didn't like that statement and responded through a social media post writing that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=96.4s)]
*  this is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky and America will not put up with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=102.88s)]
*  it for much longer. It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=107.52s)]
*  has America's backing and Europe in the meeting. They had with Zelensky stated flatly that they [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=114.88s)]
*  cannot do the job without the United States. Probably not a great statement to have been made [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=128.88s)]
*  That's what you did. So the whole time he's like, yeah, Russia, Ukraine, you can't win. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=132.8s)]
*  And the big blow up at the Oval Office. He's like, you're not winning without us, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=138.32s)]
*  you don't have no chance. And then JD Vance is talking about how they were retreating from the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=142.4s)]
*  front lines and they didn't have enough Ukrainian soldiers anymore for the front lines. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=147.12s)]
*  All you did was hurt our chances of getting at peace. So now look, we know, dude, you want the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=151.76s)]
*  minerals for Elon, we got it. They have a lot of lithium, we got it, we got it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  So all you want is, my donors, we gotta get paid. We're not gonna get the minerals, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=162.16s)]
*  we're not gonna get it. Tesla and other companies are gonna get the minerals, okay? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=167.76s)]
*  So it's not Zelensky torpedoing peace, it's Trump torpedoing peace because he wants to get his, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  him and Elon wanna get their grubby fingers on those minerals, most importantly, lithium [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=180.08s)]
*  in Ukraine. They've totally torpedoed peace and I'm sick of it, I'm disgusted by it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  Now we're gonna have to probably ironically spend more money on Ukraine, not less. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Now see, he says, we're pulling out, okay. Congratulations, Putin must be so happy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=196.24s)]
*  I just wanna remind you guys, look, you're on the right, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  and you say I don't wanna spend any more money on this, I understand that. I'm not hating on you [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=205.28s)]
*  for that. If you say, look, I don't want this, I just wanna withdraw from the world, I wanna [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=208.8s)]
*  withdraw from there, that's their problem, not our problem. I don't agree, but I understand it, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=213.44s)]
*  okay? But if you're like Vance and Trump and some of these other goons, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=217.2s)]
*  actively seemingly rooting for Russia, what are you doing? Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=223.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=229.04s)]
*  Russia rolled their tanks in and started murdering Ukrainians, so Putin's ego could be a little [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=230.16s)]
*  higher. I know how parts of Ukraine, I'm just like Stalin or whatever he thinks in his dumbass [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=236.8s)]
*  head. I'm going to conquer more land and Trump's like, yeah, go ahead, go ahead. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=243.28s)]
*  So what's he gonna do if he attacks now that he's encouraged him so much? What if he goes into a NATO [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=248.4s)]
*  country? What if he goes into Estonia? What are we gonna do? We're not gonna do anything, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=253.12s)]
*  and NATO's not gonna exist anymore. We're gonna be much weaker, Russia's gonna be much stronger. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=259.04s)]
*  None of this is America first at all. It's Elon Musk first, lithium first, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=266.16s)]
*  and it's making peace much harder. So they're already off the rails, totally off the rails. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=272.4s)]
*  And by the way, this move follows an order by Pete Hegseth last week, ordering the US [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=277.76s)]
*  Cyber Command to halt offensive cyber and information operations against Russia, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  as long as negotiations to end the war are ongoing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=290.08s)]
*  So, I mean, it seems like the Trump administration has just completely given up on [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia, or even pursuing a fair peace agreement. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=301.68s)]
*  Because again, a peace agreement, put yourself in Zelensky's shoes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  If the United States approaches you, okay, or any foreign country approaches you and says, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=314.88000000000005s)]
*  we want a peace agreement. And so you need to sign off on giving us your natural resources, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=320.32000000000005s)]
*  and in return, we will guarantee you nothing. Would you take that deal? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=327.36s)]
*  What kind of deal is that? That's not a deal. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=330.88s)]
*  Yeah, and what is this thing about stopping the cyber war with Russia? If we are being antagonistic [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=332.48s)]
*  and aggressive against Russia in some sort of cyber attack, I'm against it, I don't want it, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=339.44s)]
*  right? But if they're doing a cyber war against us, and we're doing a cyber war against them, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=344.24s)]
*  and now all of a sudden we unilaterally surrendered, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=350.64s)]
*  do we even have our cyber defenses anymore against Russia? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=354.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=356.88000000000005s)]
*  Or is it just open season? Because for whatever reason, Donald Trump seems to just love and adore [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. And again, as one of our members, smartest audience in the world, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  wrote in earlier and made a great point. Okay, so I don't want to give any money or weapons to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine anymore. Well, how about Israel? Why are we giving them endless money and weapons? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=374.72s)]
*  Why aren't we drawing any lines on that in Yahoo? And by the way, right now, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  Israel is ending the ceasefire and going back to annihilating the Gazans. So what happened to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=385.76s)]
*  pro-peace? What happened to anti-war? Okay, so this is never about peace or war. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=391.2s)]
*  We actually want peace. And unlike apparently other parts of the left, I am perfectly happy [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=396.56s)]
*  to work with the populist right on being anti-war. And I'll take all the heat in the world from [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  everyone on the left for working with you guys to actually be anti-war. But if you say, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=409.52s)]
*  well, now war's more likely to continue in Ukraine and more likely to continue in Gaza. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=415.52s)]
*  But don't worry, Elon Musk wants the lithium in Ukraine and then Yahoo paid off Trump, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=420.88s)]
*  so it's okay now. No, it's not okay. I don't care that Trump and his donors got paid off. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=425.76s)]
*  I'm anti-war. Are people on the left and right anti-war or are they not? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=431.68s)]
*  So okay, if you say no, I'd rather make sure that Tesla gets the lithium and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=438.88s)]
*  and Mary Maddison gives Donald Trump another $300 million. Okay, then you're pro-corruption, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=443.76s)]
*  pro-swamp. You were never anti-war in the first place. So let's see. Let's see what people are [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=449.76s)]
*  actually. But on this one, MAG is a lost cause. On Israel, it's a different story. On other issues, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=456.16s)]
*  it's a different story. But they've totally mind locked on Elon Musk. Elon must have the lithium. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=462.08s)]
*  Elon must have the minerals. We must have the minerals. Zelensky's a dictator terrible. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=469.28s)]
*  Putin is so beloved and okay, go celebrate Putin, a dictator, vicious, anti-American. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  He hates America. He's laughing at us now. And okay, so if you think that Trump's celebrating him [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=483.12s)]
*  and Hegs taking away our defenses against him is a good idea. I don't know when you lost the thread, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=490.64s)]
*  but none of this is anti-war. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_NG1MFMyU&t=497.28s)]
