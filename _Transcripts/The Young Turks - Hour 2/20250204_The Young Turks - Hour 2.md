"On Friday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., responding to written questions from Senate Democrats, revealed information about his personal history that was not yet part of the public record: He had settled at least one case in which he had been accused of ‚Äúmisconduct or inappropriate behavior.‚Äù Kennedy also acknowledged that he had been party to at least one non-disclosure agreement.

But in that reply Kennedy provided no details about these allegations. He only offered a one-word reply when asked if he had ever been accused in such a fashion: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Senate Committee NARROWLY Votes To Move RFK Jr's Nomination for HHS Head Forward
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps)
*  We'll call the roll. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Grassley. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=1.74s)]
*  Mr. Grassley, aye. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=2.74s)]
*  Mr. Cornyn. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=3.74s)]
*  Mr. Cornyn, aye. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=4.74s)]
*  Ms. Cortez Masto. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=5.74s)]
*  Ms. Cortez Masto, no. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=6.74s)]
*  Ms. Warren. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=7.74s)]
*  Ms. Warren, no. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=8.74s)]
*  Mr. Sanders. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=9.74s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, the final tally was 14 ayes, 13 nays. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=10.74s)]
*  The vote was 14-13. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=15.5s)]
*  The nomination is reported. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=17.02s)]
*  This morning, the Senate Finance Committee voted to advance RFK Jr.'s nomination as Health [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=20.78s)]
*  and Human Services Secretary in the Trump administration. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=27.74s)]
*  The 14-13 vote was divided along party lines. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Now, Kennedy's victory came after he managed to win over a Republican Senator, Bill Cassidy, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=35.76s)]
*  who was kind of on the fence about it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=42.099999999999994s)]
*  Cassidy is a doctor, and last week he had signaled that he had some reservations and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  some serious issues with Kennedy, and questioned whether he was even qualified to be the head [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  of the Department of Health and Human Services. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=54.9s)]
*  He even admitted that he was struggling with this decision. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=57.32s)]
*  Well, that has now changed, obviously. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=60.16s)]
*  Ahead of the vote this morning, Cassidy wrote this on X. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=62.68s)]
*  I've had very intense conversations with Bobby and the White House over the weekend, and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=66.44s)]
*  even this morning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  I wanna thank Vice President JD specifically for his honest counsel with the serious commitments [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=73.2s)]
*  I've received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=80.44s)]
*  we agree on, like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=85.64s)]
*  I will vote yes, and vote yes he did. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=90.4s)]
*  So according to NBC News, Cassidy needed to hear an unequivocal statement from Kennedy [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=93.56s)]
*  that vaccines do not cause autism, and that he would listen to scientists and follow the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=99.64s)]
*  scientific evidence on the matter. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=107.4s)]
*  However, it's unclear whether or not Kennedy agreed to Cassidy's demand. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=109.76s)]
*  We don't know if RFK Jr gave him the statement, the unequivocal statement that he was looking [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=115.08s)]
*  for. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=119.72s)]
*  With Cassidy's support, Kennedy is much more likely to be confirmed given Republicans 53 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=120.72s)]
*  to 47 advantage in the Senate. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=125.96s)]
*  Kennedy can afford three no votes among Republicans, assuming every Democratic senator opposes [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=129.1s)]
*  his nomination. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=134.76s)]
*  And so there are a few other Republicans or Republican senators, namely Susan Collins, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=136.4s)]
*  Mitch McConnell and Lisa Murkowski, who may still vote against Kennedy, but most members [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=143.16s)]
*  of the conference have rallied around his nomination. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=148.24s)]
*  But as this news breaks, there were some bad news stories coming out about alleged sexual [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=152.92s)]
*  misconduct involving RFK Jr, some settlements that have come to light. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=159.84s)]
*  We'll get to the details on that in just a minute. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=164.04s)]
*  So I think because of one of those stories, it's not guaranteed that he's gonna get confirmed. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=167.0s)]
*  And remember, he's not really a right winger, he's kind of his own thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=173.96s)]
*  And so he's got some left-wing positions, he has plenty of right-wing positions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=178.52s)]
*  And so, but the one that I'm most not concerned about, the one that's most relevant is right-wingers [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=183.68s)]
*  trying to leak against him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=191.52s)]
*  So since he's not really one of them, getting rid of him isn't necessarily so bad for them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=193.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good point, Cenk. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  And it turns out that his closest aide, who's been working with him for over a decade, is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=203.12s)]
*  pretty left-wing and is very outspoken on social media and says things that conservatives are [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=210.16s)]
*  not in favor of. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=218.44s)]
*  So you had floated the possibility that some of these negative news stories could be leaked [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=219.96s)]
*  by right-wingers. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  And I'm beginning to think there's some merit to that argument. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and so if he loses, it's not the end of the world for them. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=230.56s)]
*  And remember, there's right-wing voters who generally like Kennedy, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=234.4s)]
*  Then there's right-wing politicians and consultants and lobbyists, and they don't like Kennedy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=247.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=248.52s)]
*  They might not like him for a different reason than we do, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=249.52s)]
*  And they might be less concerned about the vaccines. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  Although I bet the pharmaceutical companies are pretty concerned about the vaccines too. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  But the food companies are like, whoa, this guy's an environmentalist, this guy sues corporations, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=259.56s)]
*  right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=268.2s)]
*  And now he's gonna come in here and actually try to keep the food safe. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=269.2s)]
*  That's gonna cost us money, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=273.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=274.8s)]
*  And then the pharmaceutical company's gotta be thinking, look, man, what if he gets off [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=275.8s)]
*  the vaccine and gets onto the real problem, which is that we don't allow for negotiating [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=278.54s)]
*  of our prices. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  We just force the American government to pay whatever ransom we want. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=284.94s)]
*  If he gets into that, that's trillions of dollars. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=288.72s)]
*  So all of a sudden, right-wing leaking against Bobby Kennedy Jr. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=291.64000000000004s)]
*  So that's super interesting turn of events here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=295.0s)]
*  So it gets by committee, but remember they gotta vote for the whole Senate now. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEka2eSm3ps&t=297.9s)]
