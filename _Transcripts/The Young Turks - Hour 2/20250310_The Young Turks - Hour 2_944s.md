TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# HOW IS THIS GUY THE LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATS?!?!
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw)
*  I'm trying to figure out what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=0.0s)]
*  leverage we actually have. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=1.98s)]
*  What leverage do we have? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=3.96s)]
*  They control the House, the Senate, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=5.32s)]
*  and the presidency. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  It's their government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=9.58s)]
*  What leverage do we have? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=11.84s)]
*  We have them on the run, and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=13.36s)]
*  we're going to keep our foot [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=16.3s)]
*  on the gas pedal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm totally believing that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=21.62s)]
*  That was a persuasive delivery from [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=22.96s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  House Minority Leader, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=26.94s)]
*  was what say you? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=28.88s)]
*  I mean, I'm old enough to remember [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=31.72s)]
*  2008 in the Tea Party. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=34.04s)]
*  People, Democrats at the time were [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  saying, this is all AstroTurf. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  This is all coke money paying [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=40.76s)]
*  people to go to protests. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=42.48s)]
*  That's fine, but guess what? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=44.08s)]
*  There was a freaking response. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  And Mitch McConnell was basically [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=48.44s)]
*  like, I'm going to throw sand in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=51.16s)]
*  the gears at every single turn and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=53.72s)]
*  I'm going to obstruct this guy's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=56.56s)]
*  government. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=58.96s)]
*  Our goal is to make this due to one [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  term president. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=61.6s)]
*  That's how they responded. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=62.6s)]
*  These guys got wiped out in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=64.44s)]
*  the midterms in 2006. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=67.04s)]
*  And that midterm wave floated into [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=69.56s)]
*  2008 where the Democrats had [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  58 people in the Senate, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=74.62s)]
*  obviously overwhelming majorities [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  in the House. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  Did the Republicans and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=81.12s)]
*  the teabaggers say, no, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=82.68s)]
*  what are we going to do? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=84.48s)]
*  It was an actual historical [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=86.48s)]
*  mandate, by the way, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=88.44s)]
*  when it comes to Barack Obama. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  They say, no, what are we going to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=92.12s)]
*  do when Kroger get in our boots? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=93.72s)]
*  We can't do anything. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=95.04s)]
*  It's their government. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=96.0s)]
*  No, they did every single thing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  they could. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  They did every dirty backwards [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=100.76s)]
*  maneuver they could to stop [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  the agenda of the freaking moderate [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  ass Barack Obama. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=107.64s)]
*  But yet, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=109.28s)]
*  Jeffries is talking about, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=110.04s)]
*  they're the ones with the majority. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=112.04s)]
*  They're the ones that got a three [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=115.16s)]
*  majority in the House. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=116.44s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=117.56s)]
*  It's a joke, these people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=118.52s)]
*  But was you're being so unfair. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=120.32s)]
*  That's what Hakeem Jeffries said [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  just a few weeks ago. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  He has now changed his message. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=125.8s)]
*  Now, Democrats got those [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=128.04s)]
*  Republicans on the run. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Okay, better watch out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=132.28s)]
*  You could tell he doesn't even [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=134.24s)]
*  believe what he's saying. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=135.96s)]
*  His delivery was awful. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=137.32s)]
*  Anyway, so Jeffries claims that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=139.44s)]
*  Democrats are really putting [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=142.2s)]
*  Republicans feet to the fire. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=145.6s)]
*  The right wing is concerned about [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  the Democratic Party, right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=149.56s)]
*  And so, he claims this during [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  a virtual call by the way with [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=154.2s)]
*  other Democratic leaders including [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=156.76s)]
*  DNC chair Ken Martin and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=160.0s)]
*  also Democratic representative, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=162.16s)]
*  Jamie Raskin. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=165.52s)]
*  Now, Jeffries specifically [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=166.72s)]
*  mentioned three issues during [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=168.32s)]
*  this call. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=169.96s)]
*  The first being the economy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=170.68s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=172.2s)]
*  We have the Republicans on the run [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  on three core issues. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=176.56s)]
*  They are on the run in terms of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  the economy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Republicans are crashing the economy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=185.64s)]
*  in real time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=187.92s)]
*  Donald Trump gave one of the most [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=189.72s)]
*  divisive speeches by a president in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=191.92s)]
*  American history, 100 minutes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  And he barely spent any time on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  the economy, why? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=201.0s)]
*  Because it's collapsing on his [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=202.04s)]
*  watch. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  They made promises with respect to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  lowering costs, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=207.76s)]
*  costs aren't going down. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=208.6s)]
*  They're going up, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=211.56s)]
*  inflation is going up. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  You know what's coming down? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump's poll numbers. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=214.56s)]
*  Because he is mismanaging the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=217.56s)]
*  economy and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=219.6s)]
*  the American people are feeling it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=220.44s)]
*  And we're just at the 45 day mark. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  No, man, they got to find another [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=227.76s)]
*  house minority leader. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=229.76s)]
*  I just, why is he such a bad public [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  speaker? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=233.76s)]
*  What's the issue here? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=234.4s)]
*  And also, look, he didn't even say [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=236.72s)]
*  many things there that were [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=238.84s)]
*  incorrect. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=240.56s)]
*  The one thing that I take issue [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=241.68s)]
*  with is that Donald Trump's poll [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  numbers, he's really suffering. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=245.0s)]

*  Hakeem Jeffries, of course, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=585.88s)]
*  was part of that complainathon. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=587.64s)]
*  An anonymous senior House Democrat [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=589.56s)]

*  frustrated at the groups. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=594.12s)]
*  Resign. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, yeah, I'm so sick of the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=596.92s)]
*  flaccid leadership of the Democratic [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=601.72s)]

*  But then let me also just add one [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=610.52s)]
*  other thing. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=612.24s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=614.8s)]
*  Congressman Al Green protesting [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=617.04s)]
*  Donald Trump's speech, right? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=619.76s)]
*  He gave a speech, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=622.5999999999999s)]
*  joint session of Congress. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  We don't call it State of the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=624.92s)]
*  Union because he just got [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=625.88s)]
*  inaugurated for a second term. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  You get the point. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=627.76s)]
*  Al Green gets kicked out of the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=628.92s)]
*  House chambers where the speech was [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=631.3199999999999s)]
*  taking place because he's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=634.36s)]
*  being rowdy and he was trying to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=637.4s)]
*  draw attention to the fact that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=639.48s)]
*  the Trump administration does not [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=641.64s)]
*  have a mandate to gut our social [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=644.0s)]
*  safety net, our social safety net [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=646.2s)]
*  programs. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=648.6s)]
*  And he was talking about Medicaid [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=649.48s)]
*  and all of that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=650.96s)]
*  He's a member of the House. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=651.72s)]
*  He knows what's been going on with [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=653.08s)]
*  Medicaid, with the budget framework [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=655.2s)]
*  that the House just passed. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=657.72s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=660.1600000000001s)]
*  People like Jeffries, leadership [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=661.5600000000001s)]
*  in the Democratic Party urged [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=663.9200000000001s)]
*  members of the Democratic Party to [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=666.88s)]
*  avoid engaging in any type of [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=668.68s)]
*  protest. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=670.12s)]
*  Now look, I think the paddles were [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=671.12s)]
*  embarrassing. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=673.0s)]
*  I think the matching outfits were [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=674.12s)]
*  embarrassing. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=675.92s)]
*  It doesn't accomplish anything. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=677.16s)]
*  It's sad, it's weak, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=678.8399999999999s)]
*  it's pathetic. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=680.28s)]
*  And I get that some people were [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=682.04s)]
*  uncomfortable with what Al Green [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=683.48s)]
*  did. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=685.0799999999999s)]
*  I wasn't, because Al Green had [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=685.6s)]
*  a substantive message and was [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=687.88s)]
*  trying to get attention on that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=690.24s)]
*  message. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=692.68s)]
*  And the best way to do that is in [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=694.1999999999999s)]
*  the context of Donald Trump's [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=696.08s)]
*  speech where he's bragging about [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=697.84s)]
*  the mandate that he gets. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=699.72s)]
*  I do not believe for a second that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=701.4000000000001s)]
*  MAGA, that Republican voters, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=703.5200000000001s)]
*  casted their ballots for that man [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  thinking that he was going to gut [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=708.2800000000001s)]
*  Social Security or Medicaid or [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=710.6s)]
*  any of these incredibly popular [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  programs. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=714.96s)]
*  Look at the polling. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=715.84s)]
*  The majority of Republicans want to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=717.1600000000001s)]
*  protect these programs. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=718.88s)]
*  So Al Green drawing attention to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  that is important. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=722.4000000000001s)]
*  Now if Al Green was like he stood [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=723.48s)]
*  and was waving his cane around and [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=725.24s)]
*  making some BS argument, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=727.4000000000001s)]

*  transports. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=731.6400000000001s)]

*  persuade the American people. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=745.0400000000001s)]

*  the Trump administration is trying [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=748.1600000000001s)]
*  to dismantle these programs, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=749.96s)]
*  that is important. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=751.5200000000001s)]

*  that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=754.84s)]

*  Democrat who spoke with Axios, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=756.88s)]

*  Thursday morning, embarrassing. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=785.32s)]
*  So that's my problem with [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=787.32s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, aside from his [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=789.0s)]

*  you see, Trump thinks it's sad [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=810.36s)]

*  Nancy Pelosi is for what? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=822.76s)]

*  effective communicator. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=826.12s)]

*  He's a money guy in the party. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  They wanted that money continuity, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=841.56s)]
*  so they put him at the helm of this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=843.52s)]
*  He's not some master legislator. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=845.4s)]
*  He's not going to whip up votes the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=847.76s)]
*  next time there's a Democratic [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=849.8s)]

*  No, he's just an establishment [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=856.04s)]
*  cuck, that's it. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's why he was picked. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=860.68s)]
*  And there are consequences to that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QVLFqNDNw&t=862.88s)]
