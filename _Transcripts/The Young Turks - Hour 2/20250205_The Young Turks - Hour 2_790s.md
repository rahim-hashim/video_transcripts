"Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced a bill on Tuesday that would cap credit card interest rates at 10% ‚àí an effort by two lawmakers who rarely see eye to eye.

Credit card interest rates refer to the fee a card issuer charges if a consumer doesn‚Äôt pay off their credit card balance in full by a certain date. The average credit card interest rate is over 20%, according to data from Bankrate."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# BERNIE DOES THE UNTHINKABLE
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU)
*  Forbes magazine just estimated last week that the average, average credit card APR in your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=0.0s)]
*  networks is 28.75% average, 29%, let's call it, 29%. It's nearly doubled in the last four [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=5.76s)]
*  years. That is astounding. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=18.16s)]
*  Mr. Trump, you talked about a 10% cap on interest rates for credit cards. That's a great idea. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=20.52s)]
*  Well, you know what, John? I'm gonna introduce that legislation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=29.44s)]
*  And guess what? Senator Bernie Sanders along with Senator Josh Hawley did just that. They have now [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=34.4s)]
*  officially introduced legislation with this bipartisan support in an effort to cap [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=41.28s)]
*  credit card interest rates. Now, when I say bipartisan support, we're gonna wait and see [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=48.0s)]
*  how much bipartisan support we're really talking about. But nonetheless, Josh Hawley, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=51.84s)]
*  who is a Republican, has been very vocal in pushing for this type of legislation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=56.88s)]
*  But will Donald Trump follow through on his campaign promise? Because he himself had [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  previously said on the campaign trail that he wants to cap credit card interest rates. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=68.56s)]
*  So look, we'll come back to Donald Trump. But first, it's important to understand what's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  in this bill, what it's actually gonna do. According to the press release put out by [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=77.84s)]
*  Sanders and Hawley, the Sanders-Hawley bill would immediately cap credit card interest rates at 10%. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=82.8s)]
*  The legislation would be in effect for five years. I don't know why it wouldn't just be permanent, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  but maybe economic changes, they wanna revisit it, who knows? But still, it's a great start. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  They wanna cap it at 10% for five years. So why are these two typically [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  ideologically opposed lawmakers joining forces? Well, this bipartisan bill comes after a recent [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=105.84s)]
*  Forbes report found that the average credit card interest rate is 28.6%, even though banks [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=111.84s)]
*  are able to borrow money from the Federal Reserve at less than 4.5%. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  So look, I get it. You wanna charge an interest rate high enough to turn a profit. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=125.76s)]
*  But think about that profit. Banks borrow the money at 4.5%, and then they loan it out at 28.6%. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  That's insane. So last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that over [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=141.84s)]
*  the last 10 years, average APR on credit cards assessed interest rate almost doubled from 12.9% [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=146.72s)]
*  in late 2023 to 22.8% in 2023. And that's the highest level recorded since the Federal Reserve [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  began collecting this data in 1994. And while customers suffer, the banks are [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=162.96s)]
*  absolutely making out like bandits, I mean, clearly. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=168.72s)]
*  So in 2023, excess APR margin may have cost the average cardholder over $250. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  Major credit card companies earned an estimated $25 billion in additional interest revenue [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=180.24s)]
*  by raising APR margins. So the Sanders-Hawley press release also notes that in 2022, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=186.8s)]
*  credit card companies charged a whopping $130 billion in interest rates and fees. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=195.6s)]
*  And this is something that I've talked about on the show before, but I really wanna reiterate it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=202.0s)]
*  because credit card debt right now is at an all-time high. We're talking about $1.17 trillion [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=205.92s)]
*  in credit card debt, outstanding credit card debt. And as of 2023, the average household [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  had over $21,000 in credit card debt. And I remember doing stories about student loan debt, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=220.8s)]
*  especially when it surpassed a trillion dollars. You have to keep in mind that that's bad, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=226.72s)]
*  that's definitely bad. But usually, if we're talking about federal student loans, the interest [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=231.52s)]
*  rates are not 28%. They're much, much lower. Now we're talking about credit card debt at $1.17 [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  trillion with an average 28% interest rate. That is crazy. It is crushing Americans, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=245.28s)]
*  and I'm happy that Hawley and Sanders have teamed up to do this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=251.68s)]
*  Now, before we get to the Donald Trump angle of this, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=256.08s)]
*  I wanna hear your thoughts on the effort, the bipartisan effort that we're seeing in the Senate [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=260.32s)]
*  was. I mean, I think it's important that when Republicans claim to be for things that we care [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=264.8s)]
*  about that we take them at their word. And I think that's what Bernie Sanders is trying to do [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=271.52s)]
*  here. It's like he doesn't see any inconsistencies in terms of his own agenda and project with [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=276.88s)]
*  working with the Republicans, so long as it's something that he believes in. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=284.4s)]
*  And this is something that hurts working ordinary people. So it fits right into the Sanders agenda. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  And Josh Hawley, along with JD Vance and a couple of others in the Republican GOP, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=294.56s)]
*  are people who are self-proclaimed members of the new right, a more populous, less neoliberal [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  segment of the right wing. And some people say, they're full of crap, they don't really believe [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=308.24s)]
*  in any of that, which may be true. We may be proven to be wrong about that. But Bernie Sanders, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  drafting a bill that is so obviously in favor of working people and working families and doing so [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  with the Republican, I don't see anything wrong with that at all. I'm not one of these people who [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=326.64s)]
*  thinks if a Republican breathes on something, it's got cooties and we need to stay away from it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=330.64s)]
*  Yeah, in fact, strategically speaking, I think this is a brilliant move by Senator Sanders because [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=335.44s)]
*  if these Republican lawmakers and Donald Trump himself are in fact full of crap, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  this is the way you find out. And this is something that you can run with. I mean, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=349.44s)]
*  Bernie Sanders is serving in his last term in the Senate, so it's not about him running with it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  But if Republicans vote against capping the credit card interest rates, well, Democrats, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=360.16s)]
*  if they're smart, would run their reelection campaigns on that issue and make it abundantly [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=366.16s)]
*  clear that these Republican lawmakers are not what they say they are. They don't care about [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  the working class in this country. They only pretend to in order to win elections. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=377.04s)]
*  And I mean, look at what's going on with these credit card companies, it's kind of insane. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  So companies are making a lot of revenue through charging these extremely high interest rates. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=386.32s)]
*  So in the last five years, for instance, Visa made $67.5 billion in profits and paid its executive [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=392.64s)]
*  chair and former CEO Alfred Kelly Jr. Nearly $140 million in total compensation. MasterCard made [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=399.44s)]
*  $44.3 billion in profits, not revenue, profits, and paid its CEO Michael [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=407.84s)]
*  Maibach $77.7 million in total compensation. And American Express made $33.8 billion in profits [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  and paid their CEO $157.2 million in total compensation. So Senator Sanders says the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=424.0s)]
*  credit card companies are engaged in extortion and loan sharking. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=431.6s)]
*  And Josh Hawley agrees saying that working Americans are drowning in record credit card debt [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=436.24s)]
*  while the biggest credit card issuers get richer and richer by hiking their interest rates [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=441.76000000000005s)]
*  to the moon. It's not just wrong, it's exploitative, and it needs to end. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=446.8s)]
*  Capping credit card interest rates at 10%, just like President Trump campaigned on, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=452.0s)]
*  is a simple way to provide meaningful relief to working people. Let's do it. And as Sanders and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=457.68s)]
*  Hawley said, on the campaign trail, Trump actually voiced support for capping credit [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  card interest rates at 10%. Let's take a look. And while working Americans catch up, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=469.12s)]
*  we're going to put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. We have no choice. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  They're getting 22%, 25%. We can't let people have to pay 25% and 22% interest [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=481.36s)]
*  because they can't afford to pay off their credit card. We're gonna cap it for a period of time at [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=490.56s)]
*  10%. There you heard it, clear as day. You hear the audience, they love it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=495.6s)]
*  You hear Hawley say, basically reference Donald Trump and what he allegedly wants to do. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=502.24s)]
*  Now he's gonna have to prove whether he actually meant it. And look, there's no doubt that he's [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=508.8s)]
*  gonna face a lot of pressure from his corporate backers. He does have corporate backers. He has [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=513.28s)]
*  Wall Street lobbyists attempting to get him to abandon this plan. When he first proposed the cap [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=517.92s)]
*  to the American Bankers Association, or when he first proposed the cap, the American Bankers [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=524.16s)]
*  Association immediately shot it down, obviously, that's what they're gonna do. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=529.2s)]
*  And they did so again today, and they were definitely not alone. So here were the hilarious [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  comments from Michael Strain, who's the director at the American Enterprise Institute. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=539.52s)]
*  I don't like this policy at all. I think you've got a situation where Bernie Sanders is for [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=544.4s)]
*  something, the progressive left is for something, and the kind of populist nationalist right is [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=550.4s)]
*  for it. And typically when those two groups are agreeing, the policy is bad. This is a policy [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=555.04s)]
*  that is effectively a price control. This is a policy that would lead credit card lenders [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=561.28s)]
*  not to extend credit to people with relatively low credit scores. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  People who are kind of just getting started in their careers or people who, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=573.52s)]
*  for whatever reason, have a low score. Those are often people who really need credit. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=578.0s)]
*  The only way it makes sense to lend to them is to charge them a high rate of interest [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=583.04s)]
*  because their default risk is higher. And so this is a kind of classic example of a policy [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=586.8s)]
*  with that's designed with really good intentions, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=592.24s)]
*  but that would end up hurting the very people that it's designed to help. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=595.76s)]
*  My credit score is 820. I don't say that to brag. I am risk averse. I'm very careful with [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=601.28s)]
*  my finances and I live below my means, okay? I checked my interest rates on my credit cards, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=608.4799999999999s)]
*  28%. It doesn't matter if you have good credit. They want to make money, okay? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=614.8s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you have good credit, bad credit, they're gonna charge you a high [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=619.12s)]
*  interest rate. And the idea that credit card companies are no longer going to engage in this [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=621.92s)]
*  business if they're only gonna make 10% interest is laughable. But I mean, maybe he's right. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=628.64s)]
*  I don't know. What do you think, Woz? I was struck by the idea that the low credit score [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=634.8s)]
*  having people are just, they're gonna die without the $300, $500 credit card that we start folks off [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=642.16s)]
*  with. I mean, what are they gonna do without this 300 bucks a month that we're price gouging the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=648.8s)]
*  hell out of them with ridiculous interest rate? It's absurd. It's obviously insane. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=654.64s)]
*  The guy had a horrible argument. He's just basically like, well, these guys are [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  agreeing, so it must be bad. He can't go point for point why it's going to hurt American consumers. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  It's just wrong. Obviously, he has no leg to stand on, and that's why he sounded so ridiculous [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=673.28s)]
*  trying to defend this so obviously predatory practice. There's nothing to it. You can't make [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=680.08s)]
*  the argument that like, well, the feds raise interest rates on us, and we gotta cover it, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=686.08s)]
*  and we're providing the money upfront. Bro, you can't justify it if you're 7Xing [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=691.36s)]
*  your interest rates when you now give it to the American consumer. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=697.84s)]
*  Yeah, totally agree. And I'm gonna skip ahead to what happened during Donald Trump's first term. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  Now look, we have different lawmakers. Some people got voted out, so things might be different this [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=708.64s)]
*  time around. But if we take what happened in Trump's first term as an example, if we see it [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=713.6s)]
*  as a foreshadowing of what's to come, we're not gonna be too optimistic. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=719.92s)]
*  So during Trump's first term in the White House, Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=724.3199999999999s)]
*  introduced legislation that would have capped credit card interest rates at 15%. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=730.16s)]
*  Get a load of this though, just nine Democrats, nine Democrats in the House, and one in the Senate [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=734.56s)]
*  co-sponsored the bill, which received zero Republican support, none. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=741.68s)]
*  So I still think that Sanders should move forward with this strategy, because again, even if it [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=747.04s)]
*  suffers the same fate as the bill that was proposed in Trump's first term, it's something [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=754.4s)]
*  that Democrats can use to their advantage. They can point to it and say, look, these Republicans [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=760.56s)]
*  are pretending to be for the working class, but this proves that they're not. Will they do that? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=765.1999999999999s)]
*  They didn't do it after the first term where this bill failed, but who knows? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7J7MQ8OJU&t=770.0s)]
