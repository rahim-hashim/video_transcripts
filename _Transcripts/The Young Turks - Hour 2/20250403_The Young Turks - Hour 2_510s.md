"Several members of President Trump's embattled National Security Council have been fired, a U.S. official and a second source familiar told Axios on Thursday.

Why it matters: The firings come a day after conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer visited the Oval Office and pressed Trump to fire specific NSC staffers. Axios has not confirmed whether the firings were directly linked to that incident, but the source familiar said they were "being labeled as an anti-neocon move."

# Did Laura Loomer Convince Trump To FIRE NSC Members?
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI)
*  I just think that there needs to be more appreciation demonstrated to Trump loyalists because unfortunately, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=0.0s)]
*  we do see a lot of gatekeeping in the GOP. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=7.44s)]
*  And the thing that I heart on the most during the campaign season was the importance of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=10.32s)]
*  vetting, vetting, vetting. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=14.74s)]
*  I thought that we were keeping a binder full of receipts. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=16.04s)]
*  I don't know if some of the people on the campaign meant it when they said they were [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=19.26s)]
*  keeping the receipts, but I meant it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=22.36s)]
*  I literally have a binder of receipts, and I know who's loyal and I know who is disloyal. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=24.52s)]
*  That's Laura Loomer. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=31.0s)]
*  And apparently she got several people within the Trump administration fired recently. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=32.24s)]
*  They're specifically individuals who were members of the National Security Council. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=37.32s)]
*  And so Loomer shows up to the White House, has a nice little conversation, and boom, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=43.08s)]
*  these people are gone. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  And so what was behind all of this? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=49.1s)]
*  Well, apparently Signalgate was the reasoning behind, wait, was it Signalgate? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=51.04s)]
*  Maybe it wasn't. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=56.84s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=57.84s)]
*  That these individuals are neocons, they need to go. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=59.24s)]
*  Neocons don't represent the best interests of the Trump administration and the MAGA movement. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=62.88s)]
*  But Signalgate does play a role in this because Mike Walz is still employed by the Trump administration. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=67.64s)]
*  So we're gonna get to all that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=75.4s)]
*  And I'm conflicted in this story for a number of reasons. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  And I'm also befuddled because Laura Loomer is anti-Muslim and she's said it proudly in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=81.12s)]
*  the past. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=88.12s)]
*  She claims now that she's not, but okay. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=89.12s)]
*  She said a lot of anti-Muslim things that are hard to take back. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=90.76s)]
*  If she means they're great, but I'd be shocked, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=95.0s)]
*  And she's pro-Israel, and pro-Israel usually is neocon, right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=98.4s)]
*  So the neocons are the ones that wanted us to invade seven countries on behalf of Israel. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  So she's trying to get the neocons fired? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=109.66s)]
*  Either there's something wrong with this story and they're reporting it kind of wrong, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=113.84s)]
*  Or if it's true, is Laura Loomer principled? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=118.96s)]
*  And she's actually against neocons? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=122.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=124.2s)]
*  That's, I don't know, that would be shocking. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=125.2s)]
*  I'm gonna reserve judgment on that because look, facts of the matter is the Trump administration [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=127.16s)]
*  at this moment is full to the brim with neocons. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=133.96s)]
*  And I'm not just talking about low level officials at the National Security Council. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=137.02s)]
*  I'm talking about cabinet officials. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=142.0s)]
*  Marco Rubio is a neocon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=145.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=148.24s)]
*  So is Waltz. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=149.24s)]
*  Waltz is a, yes, Mike Waltz is a neocon. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=150.24s)]
*  Another one is Pete Hegseth. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=152.76s)]
*  Pete Hegseth is a neocon. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=154.04s)]
*  So it's- [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=156.4s)]
*  Yeah, so you look some argue that Hegseth's on the bubble, okay? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=157.4s)]
*  He likes war, but is he, no, not in the book. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=160.84s)]
*  No, he's a neocon. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=165.32s)]
*  He thought that we should get, Americans should get arrested if Israel doesn't like him or [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=166.32s)]
*  something. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=170.6s)]
*  He's a neocon. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=171.6s)]
*  But anyway, some people make the argument that he's not, or that he's on the bubble. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=173.12s)]
*  But there's others too. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=176.86s)]
*  There's Mike Huckabee, the ambassador to Israel, unsurprising. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=177.86s)]
*  And then there was Elise Stefanik, who was gonna be our UN ambassador. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  But she got pulled because they were afraid of losing her seat in Congress. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=183.82000000000002s)]
*  And she caught a lot of feelings over that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=187.18s)]
*  But at least she got pulled. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=189.08s)]
*  But Mike Waltz is in the room when Laura Loomer is asking for the heads of all these neocons [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=190.5s)]
*  and he's a neocon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=194.18s)]
*  So this is a super interesting story. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=195.18s)]
*  And a lot of people say Loomer shouldn't even be in the room. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=197.5s)]
*  There I'm gonna have a little bit of a unique opinion. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=201.94000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so as I mentioned, and I was correct. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=204.10000000000002s)]
*  So this is in the wake of the Signalgate scandal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=207.66s)]
*  And so Laura Loomer goes to the White House and speaks to Trump specifically to get National [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=212.76s)]
*  Security Council officials fired. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=219.84s)]
*  And he followed through, he listened. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=222.8s)]
*  So among those who were let go include Brian Walsh, the senior director for intelligence, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=224.6s)]
*  Thomas Boudry, the senior director for legislative affairs, Maggie Doherty, the senior director [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=231.78s)]
*  for international organizations. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=240.01999999999998s)]
*  And David Fieth, the senior director overseeing technology and national security. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=242.06s)]
*  So look, to be fair, they're not low level officials. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=248.42s)]
*  These are directors within the National Security Council. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=251.7s)]
*  Now apart from the firing several other officials who had been working on or at the National [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=254.62s)]
*  Security Council were reassigned back to their home agencies over the weekend. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=261.04s)]
*  And this was even before this White House meeting took place. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=266.24s)]
*  Now notably though, as we've mentioned, Mike Waltz, who is the individual who added Atlantic [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=269.36s)]
*  journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to that Signal group message. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=275.16s)]
*  He still has his job. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=280.1s)]
*  He doesn't appear to be on the chopping block at all, which is shocking to say the least. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=281.36s)]
*  And he actually attended the meeting with Loomer, Trump, JD Vance and others. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=288.12s)]
*  A government official said that Loomer went to the White House yesterday and presented [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=292.8s)]
*  them with her research and evidence. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  The US official said Loomer was furious that neocons had slipped through the vetting process [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=299.56s)]
*  for administration jobs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  Girl, they didn't just slip through the cracks and remain or get employed by the administration. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  Again, his cabinet is full of neocons. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=313.36s)]
*  Yeah, and how did they get there? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=316.6s)]
*  Because Mary Madeleine gave him $137 million and her late husband gave him $200 million [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=318.56s)]
*  in the last two campaigns. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=324.88s)]
*  So she got to handpick a whole bunch of these folks. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=326.94s)]
*  So like this whole neocon slip through, patient zero, Mike Waltz is in the room as you guys [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=330.32s)]
*  are having this discussion. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=335.76s)]
*  So I don't know, this story doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  So maybe she has a different definition of neocon. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=340.64s)]
*  Maybe by neocon she just means anyone who has ever been disloyal to Donald Trump or [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=343.36s)]
*  criticize them. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=347.8s)]
*  That might be it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=348.8s)]
*  Maybe that's the receipt she's talking about. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=350.06s)]
*  Hey, this guy once said something bad about you, let's fire him. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=351.56s)]
*  We only want loyalists who will do what we command them to do. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=355.44s)]
*  But if she actually got real neocons fired who are pro-war, etc., that'd be awesome. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=360.7s)]
*  Because a lot of people say, Ana, what is this MAGA influencer goes in and gets senior [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=369.32s)]
*  policy guys at the White House and National Security Council fired? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=373.32s)]
*  That's crazy, right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=377.64s)]
*  Kind of, I mean, as long as the right thing happened, I don't really care who did it and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=380.04s)]
*  how they did it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=385.24s)]
*  So if Bernie was president and he listened to Kyle Kalinsky tell him to fire a bunch [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=386.36s)]
*  of neocons and we didn't go to work because of that, I'd be like, that's awesome. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=392.64s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=397.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=398.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58_NxpGlWI&t=399.2s)]
