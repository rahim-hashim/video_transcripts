"President Donald Trump reiterated his desire for the U.S. to control the Gaza Strip, calling it an "incredible piece of important real estate" following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday.

Speaking to press, Trump said "you know how I feel" about the enclave, adding that "having a peace force like the U.S. there controlling and owning" it would be a "good thing." "You call it the Freedom Zone.""

# Trump Suggests That U.S. 'Peace Force' Control Gaza
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w)
*  Mr. President, given what you've said about Gaza, did the US send troops to help secure [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=0.0s)]
*  the security back? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=5.0s)]
*  As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=7.58s)]
*  If it's necessary, we'll do that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=10.92s)]
*  It's been made very clear to the President that the United States needs to be involved [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=13.02s)]
*  in this rebuilding effort to ensure stability in the region for all people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=18.32s)]
*  That does not mean boots on the ground in Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  It does not mean American taxpayers will be funding this effort. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  He did not rule out American troops in Gaza last night. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=28.22s)]
*  Are you doing that now? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=31.02s)]
*  I am saying that the President has not committed to that just yet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  Well, it appears that he's now committing to it because, well, in early February, President [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=35.58s)]
*  Donald Trump suggested that the United States would send troops to Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=41.06s)]
*  We would have boots on the ground to essentially assist Israel in ethnically cleansing Palestinians [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=46.5s)]
*  from the land that belongs to them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=54.34s)]
*  But today, Trump stated that that whole idea is back on, even though following backlash [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=57.36s)]
*  in February, he kind of backed off that message, Cenk. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  So during a sit down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, Donald Trump said [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=67.92s)]
*  this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=75.24s)]
*  The idea is fighting to get into Gaza strip. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=76.24s)]
*  I myself might be called up in a month. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=77.24s)]
*  Do you think that's the way to pressure Hamas to get to a deal? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=78.24s)]
*  Do you think blocking humanitarian aid is also an effective pressure? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=79.24s)]
*  Well, you know how I feel about the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=80.24s)]
*  I think it's a very good idea. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=81.24s)]
*  I think it's a good idea. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=82.24s)]
*  And I think it's something that we would be involved in. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=83.24s)]
*  But having a peace force like the United States there controlling and owning the Gaza Strip [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  would be a good thing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=91.64s)]
*  So in other words, we're going to send the men and women of our armed forces to the Gaza [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=96.64s)]
*  Strip, boots on the ground to serve as aid to the people of Gaza. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=105.0s)]
*  To the Gaza Strip boots on the ground to serve as a peace force because Donald Trump sees [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=110.72s)]
*  the Gaza Strip as a very important piece of real estate. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=115.54s)]
*  This whole thing is so utterly disgusting. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=121.44s)]
*  Absolutely, not only is the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians disgusting, Cenk, but the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=124.68s)]
*  idea of us potentially risking the lives of our soldiers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=130.08s)]
*  Let's keep it real on behalf of Israel. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=135.88s)]
*  That's what this is really about. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=137.44s)]
*  You think Israel is going to be like, yeah, this belongs to the United States, which by [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=138.44s)]
*  the way, I don't want it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=141.12s)]
*  Even if that was true, I wouldn't want it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=142.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=144.92s)]
*  But it's not about the United States owning important real estate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=145.92s)]
*  This is about doing favors for Israel in which, by the way, Donald Trump has been doing an [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=148.6s)]
*  excellent job, excellent job looking out for his homie, Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=153.76s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm going to get a lot into that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=157.56s)]
*  But first, slightly lighter note, Spider-Man Dragon rights on tyt.com. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=159.46s)]
*  I guess Netanyahu will get his own room in the White House. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, he's there more than Melania. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=166.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=168.16s)]
*  It does certainly seem that way. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=168.68s)]
*  And Trump is certainly more polite to Netanyahu than he is to Melania. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=169.68s)]
*  He holds Netanyahu's seat in. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=172.88s)]
*  I'm not sure Melania gets similar treatment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=174.96s)]
*  So now, why is he so cozy with him? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=177.16s)]
*  Look, obviously, we'll tell you again, he's gotten $337 million from just the Adelson family, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=180.4s)]
*  Sheldon, who's now deceased, and Miriam, his widow, are very pro-right-wing Israel, maniacally [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=187.28s)]
*  pro-Netanyahu. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, Miriam is also an Israeli citizen. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=195.94s)]
*  So he's literally getting his orders from an Israeli. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=199.14s)]
*  She should go live in Israel then. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=201.72s)]
*  Yeah, she should, look- [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=203.1s)]
*  Why aren't you living in Israel? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=204.1s)]
*  Israel's so important, it's your number one priority, go live in Israel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=205.26s)]
*  What are you doing on our land, on our soil, advocating for a foreign country? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=208.26s)]
*  Go live over there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=212.89999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, the Adelson's make most of their money in China, in Macau, China, where [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=214.22s)]
*  they have giant casinos. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  So she could also live in China, she could serve China or Israel. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=220.48s)]
*  But since she gave President Trump $137 million in this last go around, to add to the $200 [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=223.86s)]
*  her husband gave him, he does whatever they order him to do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=230.34s)]
*  By the way, if you think I'm wrong, and if Trump is not affected by $337 million, and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=236.14000000000001s)]
*  that there's a different reason why he's doing whatever Netanyahu orders him to do, okay, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=242.10000000000002s)]
*  no problem, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=246.3s)]
*  But what is clear is the result. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=247.58s)]
*  So he said that ridiculous thing about how we're gonna go control Gaza, we showed you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=250.26s)]
*  some of the tape. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=254.9s)]
*  But he even said we're going to get rid of the unexploded bombs in Gaza that Israel dropped, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=256.8s)]
*  by the way, also paid for us. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=262.8s)]
*  We paid to drop the bombs or we'd pay to clean up the bombs, but most importantly, we'd pay [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=264.98s)]
*  with our lives. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=269.0s)]
*  Because the precious IDF shouldn't get hurt by those unexploded bombs, American soldiers [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=270.54s)]
*  should die instead. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=274.58s)]
*  So that was his first proposal. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=276.44s)]
*  There's a ton of pushback from MAGA, and he at least walked back the boots on the ground [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=278.16s)]
*  in Gaza, or so it seemed. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  But then his daddy visited him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=285.1s)]
*  Exactly, so Netanyahu came this time around, and apparently with a belt. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  And so after he beat Trump inside the Oval Office a little bit, or did whatever he did [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=291.36s)]
*  to him, hey, we'll give you more money, or we'll threaten to do X, Y, or Z, whatever [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  he's got, magically Trump comes back out and is like, the US is going to control Gaza. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  Now this is important. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  Because to owning the Gaza, you'd have to be the biggest sucker in the world if you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=307.88s)]
*  think that Netanyahu wants us to get rid of all the Palestinians, drive them out, and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  then just keep it instead of giving it back to Israel. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=318.04s)]
*  I can't believe anybody would be that stupid and gullible as to believe that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=321.92s)]
*  No, this is all done in favor of Israel, at the behest of Israel. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=326.56s)]
*  Israel will get that land 100% in that scenario. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=331.6s)]
*  If you don't believe that, you're an idiot. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, and have not followed politics at all in our lifetimes. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=337.04s)]
*  Okay, now, so why- [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=340.88s)]
*  By the way, I gotta jump in before you finish that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  This is, by the way, what Trump is saying after Israel killed another American citizen [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=344.8s)]
*  in the West Bank. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=351.04s)]
*  A story we'll get to in a little bit. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=352.04s)]
*  Any words for the American that was killed by Israelis, Donald Trump? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=354.04s)]
*  No, no, the American doesn't matter? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=357.72s)]
*  Okay, let's move on. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=359.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's the third American in just the last couple of months in the West Bank. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=360.88s)]
*  The IDF and the settlers are killing the Palestinians in the West Bank that have nothing to do with [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=366.72s)]
*  October 7th at a record pace. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  They're also displacing them at a record pace. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=373.04s)]
*  They're trying to right now annex Gaza and portions of the West Bank. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=376.24s)]
*  And we're supposed to pay for all this, and if it creates any more wars, we pay for that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  We blame all the Muslims, we blame the Palestinians, we blame the Christians, we blame everyone, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=384.68s)]
*  but not Israel. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=389.48s)]
*  We do everything that it's one. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=390.48s)]
*  But then now, the most important part is the word control, right? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=391.48s)]
*  So forget own, that is a 0% chance we're gonna own it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=394.56s)]
*  So why are they emphasizing control? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=397.48s)]
*  Cuz in order to occupy Gaza, they have to actually get the Palestinians out. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=400.04s)]
*  And so getting the Palestinians, there's over 2 million of them. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=406.12s)]
*  Getting them out is literal genocide, literal ethnic cleansing, and it is nearly impossible. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=408.56s)]
*  So Netanyahu doesn't want the IDF to do that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=413.96s)]
*  That's a mess. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=417.92s)]
*  They'll get blamed for it, and a lot of them will die, and they don't want that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=418.92s)]
*  So he wants America to do his dirty work for him. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=421.84s)]
*  So he's like, come in here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=425.02s)]
*  How many times do I have to order you, Donald, okay? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=426.35999999999996s)]
*  Don't make me take out the belt again, like I did to Biden. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=429.34s)]
*  Don't make me strap it around you and walk you around the goddamn park. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=433.11999999999995s)]
*  I told you, you will drive out the Palestinians and control Gaza, and then you'll hand it [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=436.12s)]
*  back to me. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=443.0s)]
*  And then I'll give you some real estate deal. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  We'll put a Trump Tower on there, and everybody's a winner. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=446.23999999999995s)]
*  All of American citizens except Palestine, the Palestinians, and the whole world. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  So I'd like one American leader to prove that Israel doesn't control us. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=461.54s)]
*  I wanna go to one more video. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=462.54s)]
*  Again, this is Donald Trump sitting right next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=464.0s)]
*  and talking about the future of Gaza and the United States' role in it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=468.16s)]
*  For years and years, all I hear about is killing and Hamas and problems. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=473.4s)]
*  And if you take the people, the Palestinians, and move them around to different countries, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  then you have plenty of countries that will do that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=482.76s)]
*  And you really have a freedom zone. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=486.52s)]
*  You call it the freedom zone, a free zone, a zone where people aren't gonna be killed [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=489.56s)]
*  every day. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=494.0s)]
*  That's a hell of a place. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=495.0s)]
*  You know what I call it? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=496.0s)]
*  A great location that nobody wants to live in, because they really don't. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  When they have good living, real living, where Hamas and all of the problems, the level of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=502.67999999999995s)]
*  death on the Gaza Strip is just incredible. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  And I've said it, I don't understand why Israel ever gave it up. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=513.8s)]
*  Israel owned it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=518.1999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't this man, so I can say it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=519.3199999999999s)]
*  He wouldn't have given it up. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=521.48s)]
*  I know him very well. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=522.48s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=523.48s)]
*  They took oceanfront property and they gave it to people for peace. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=525.28s)]
*  How did that work out? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=529.4s)]
*  Not good. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=530.4s)]
*  My God. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=531.88s)]
*  No, no, Israelis wanna live there. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=532.88s)]
*  You know Israelis wanna live there. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=535.56s)]
*  I love how he's like, nobody wants to live there. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=536.84s)]
*  No, no, Israelis wanna live there. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=539.04s)]
*  The Israeli government is getting you, you dumb ass, to do the dirty work for them. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=541.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know who else wants to live there? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=546.56s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=548.48s)]
*  The ones that we're slaughtering right now, they wanna live there. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=549.48s)]
*  Israel killed another 50 people today. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=552.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=554.24s)]
*  Because it's a slaughterhouse. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=555.24s)]
*  And this is the 18-month anniversary of October 7th. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=556.4s)]
*  A year and a half later, they're still pretending this is about October 7th. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=561.0799999999999s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=565.4799999999999s)]
*  They murdered 50 people today pretending it was about something that happened a year and [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=566.4799999999999s)]
*  a half ago that they knew 100% was gonna happen. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=569.88s)]
*  They allowed to happen. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=572.92s)]
*  Do we have an excuse to slaughter the Palestinians and take their land? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=575.0s)]
*  A year and a half later, are we gonna make America pay for all of it? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=579.9599999999999s)]
*  So here, give me another 20 billion. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=585.12s)]
*  Give me another 4 billion. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=586.64s)]
*  He calls it a freedom zone. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=588.64s)]
*  The Palestinians are free to die. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=590.64s)]
*  They're free to get moved out. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=592.7199999999999s)]
*  Then the land will be free of the Palestinians. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=594.8s)]
*  And by the way, we're free to get robbed by Israel day in, day out, year in, year out. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=597.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  And then we'll be free of our money. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  And then Israel will use our money to slaughter more Palestinians or make us slaughter more [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=603.52s)]
*  Palestinians and have the whole world hate us and then have other Muslims attack us because [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  of what we've done to the Palestinians. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=613.3199999999999s)]
*  And then go, you see how the Muslims are such radicals. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=615.16s)]
*  They hate the West. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=619.12s)]
*  You have to murder all the Muslims because they hate the West. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=621.12s)]
*  They don't hate the West. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  They hate Israel because Israel keeps slaughtering Muslims and Christians, by the way, and taking [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=625.52s)]
*  their land. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=629.64s)]
*  That's not complicated to figure out. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=630.68s)]
*  And he takes a steaming pile of crap. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=632.5s)]
*  He dumps it on America's lap and goes, let the American taxpayers deal with it and send [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=634.84s)]
*  in your guys to die instead of the beloved IDF. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=639.08s)]
*  Do my dirty work for me, dog. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=642.84s)]
*  And Donald Trump goes, and runs after his master. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=645.42s)]
*  During that press conference when Trump was asked about the voters who wanted him to end [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  the war in Gaza, not aid in a bet the war in Gaza or on Gaza, I should say. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=653.14s)]
*  Trump says the war will stop at some point, but that point won't be in the, that won't [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=658.4599999999999s)]
*  be in the too distant future. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=666.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that is what does that mean? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=670.9s)]
*  You're gonna do what Israel wants you to do like a good boy. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=671.9s)]
*  So I mean, that's what he's done so far. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=676.18s)]
*  Congratulations, you're a good boy for Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=678.5s)]
*  Absolutely embarrassing. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=682.78s)]
*  It's embarrassing for the American people that the leader of this country is aiding [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=683.78s)]
*  and abetting a genocide in Gaza and acting like a little bitch for Netanyahu. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=687.78s)]
*  I thought he would be, I don't know, a little more, I thought he would maybe care about [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=692.86s)]
*  appearing strong more than Biden did. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=700.5s)]
*  But no, I guess he's willing to be a bitch. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=703.86s)]
*  And that's exactly what he is right now in regard to this issue. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=706.7800000000001s)]
*  It's absolutely pathetic and embarrassing. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=709.4200000000001s)]
*  I think there's some chance that at some point Netanyahu will literally pat him on the head. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=711.26s)]
*  Why wouldn't he? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=716.38s)]
*  Because he's treating him just like he did with Biden. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=717.38s)]
*  Look at this little boy that I bought. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=719.7800000000001s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=721.86s)]
*  Okay, hey, walk around the park for me, okay, Donnie Doggie? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=722.86s)]
*  And by the way, Trump's still talking about oceanfront property. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=727.38s)]
*  And he's so stupid. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=729.6600000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu, I guarantee you Netanyahu was like, it'll be Trump Towers. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=731.98s)]
*  It's a beautiful oceanfront property. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=736.3000000000001s)]
*  Remember Jared Kushner, his son-in-law was talking about it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=737.7s)]
*  He's like, the beautiful oceanfront property, why shouldn't we build there? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=740.14s)]
*  Remember, after you murder all the Palestinians on our behalf and start several different [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=743.46s)]
*  wars against America, and you pay trillions of dollars in that direction, let alone lives [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=747.0600000000001s)]
*  lost, don't worry, we'll give you a Trump Tower or two on the oceanfront. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=751.62s)]
*  And that's what this dog is chasing after. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=755.38s)]
*  So lastly, there's a perfect example of a place where you have to separate out the leaders [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=758.22s)]
*  from the voters, okay? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=764.1s)]
*  So a lot of Trump voters will agree with Trump. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=766.42s)]
*  And you'll see them all over social media going, yeah, don't your Palestinians don't [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=769.98s)]
*  belong there anyway. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=773.98s)]
*  And we're gonna have the Riviera and it's gonna be awesome. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=774.98s)]
*  And Trump's a genius and he has all this figured out. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=779.9s)]
*  He's gonna magically move out all the Palestinians to nicer places that they wanna go in these [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=782.54s)]
*  countries. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=787.3399999999999s)]
*  None of that is true, okay? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=788.3399999999999s)]
*  But there's also a huge section of Trump voters who are like, we said America first. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=789.6999999999999s)]
*  We didn't say Israel first. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=795.98s)]
*  And I'm really tired of this crap. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=797.98s)]
*  I'm tired of paying for it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=799.66s)]
*  Some of them have moral qualms about what's happening to the Palestinians. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=801.7199999999999s)]
*  But mainly it gets under their skin that this is obviously not America first, okay? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=805.22s)]
*  And they have eyes and ears. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  So when you told them Biden was young, they didn't believe you. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=814.78s)]
*  When you told them Biden was standing up to Israel, they didn't believe you. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=817.02s)]
*  And now when Trump says, I'm standing up for America first and I'm standing up to Israel, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=820.32s)]
*  but like their dog, I will do anything they command me. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=825.5400000000001s)]
*  They have eyes and ears. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=828.22s)]
*  So that portion of independence and MAGA are not interested in this at all. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=829.62s)]
*  Instead of yelling at those guys, let's make them our allies. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=834.48s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=837.2s)]
*  And unite in favor of America and not Israel. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=838.2s)]
*  Damn right. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=842.48s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=843.48s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VE3h7Rv5w&t=846.4s)]
