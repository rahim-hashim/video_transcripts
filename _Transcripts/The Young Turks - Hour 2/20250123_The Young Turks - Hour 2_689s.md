"Six college students in Massachusetts were accused of luring an active-duty service member whom they falsely described as a sexual predator to their campus, where a group of more than two dozen people chased and assaulted him, authorities said.

One of the students who was charged told police that the plot was modeled on ‚ÄúTo Catch a Predator,‚Äù NBC‚Äôs discontinued program that, during its three seasons, aimed to catch adults seeking to prey on minors using undercover cameras and decoys impersonating underage dates, according to a statement of facts in the case."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# College Students BUSTED for SICK ‚ÄòCatch a Predator‚Äô Stunt
**The Young Turks - Hour 2:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk)
*  In Worcester, Massachusetts, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=0.0s)]
*  authorities arrested six college [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=1.54s)]
*  students who they say lured a man [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=3.24s)]
*  to campus using a dating app, or [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=4.88s)]
*  he was then chased down by a group [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=6.44s)]
*  of 25 people assaulted and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=8.08s)]
*  falsely accused of being [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=9.44s)]
*  a sexual offender. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=10.74s)]
*  The ploy, please say, inspired by [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=12.32s)]
*  a social media fad that they say may [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=14.26s)]
*  be based on the former NBC TV [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=16.16s)]
*  series to catch a predator. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=17.64s)]
*  It is 100% based on the show to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=21.32s)]
*  catch a predator. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=23.72s)]
*  The unfortunate thing though is you [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  have content creators who in this [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=28.96s)]
*  specific case lured an innocent man [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=31.64s)]
*  to make him out to be a sexual [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=34.52s)]
*  predator and they then proceeded to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=36.76s)]
*  assault him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=39.76s)]
*  So let's get into the details of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=41.28s)]
*  the story. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=43.2s)]
*  First, NBC News reported on how [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=44.28s)]
*  this entire situation unfolded, so [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=46.16s)]
*  let's take a quick look at that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  It happened at Assumption [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=51.56s)]
*  University, where in court [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=52.64s)]
*  documents police say a man was [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=53.92s)]
*  invited to campus by an 18 year old [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=55.44s)]
*  student who used her real profile [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=57.28s)]
*  on the dating app Tinder. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=59.08s)]
*  Authorities say when he arrived, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=60.44s)]
*  the man whose family says is 22, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  said he and his alleged date were [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=63.84s)]
*  watching a baseball game in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=65.44s)]
*  the student lounge when the mob [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=66.84s)]
*  appeared and began calling him a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=68.48s)]
*  pedophile and accusing him of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=70.16s)]
*  liking sex with 17 year old girls. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=71.68s)]
*  The man told police the group [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=73.6s)]
*  chased him to his car where they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=74.92s)]
*  punched him in the head and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=76.36s)]
*  slammed his car door on him. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=77.48s)]
*  He got away and called police, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=79.08s)]
*  who say surveillance video shows [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=80.6s)]
*  the group of students, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=82.2s)]
*  many of whom were filming [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  the incident on their phones, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=84.6s)]
*  laughing and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=86.28s)]
*  high fiving with each other. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=86.92s)]
*  Yeah, laughing, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=89.88s)]
*  high fiving with each other. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=90.8s)]
*  It is not cute, it's not funny. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=92.28s)]
*  Doing this to an innocent [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=95.08s)]
*  individual is sick and I'm glad [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=96.6s)]
*  that there are now criminal [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=98.64s)]
*  consequences to it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=100.32s)]
*  So look, that report missed a lot [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  of details, so let's go a little [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=104.08s)]
*  deeper into how this horrible [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  incident played out. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=107.84s)]
*  So according to the statement of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  facts, the incident on October 1st [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=111.16s)]
*  was initially reported to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=113.64s)]
*  university officials the next day [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=115.4s)]
*  when student Kelsey Brainard, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=117.8s)]
*  18, said a creepy Tinder app [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=120.12s)]
*  contact had come to campus looking [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=122.2s)]
*  to meet a 17 year old girl. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=124.64s)]
*  So she texted a friend by the name [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=126.6s)]
*  of Easton Randall. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=129.04s)]
*  In his interview with campus [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=130.52s)]
*  police, Randall said he and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=132.56s)]
*  several others made suggestions [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=134.62s)]
*  about what Brainard should say in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=137.16s)]
*  her messages to the service member. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=139.64s)]
*  And that's the other thing, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=142.32s)]
*  this victim here is a service [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=144.2s)]
*  member within the military. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=146.24s)]
*  But let me give you some more [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=148.76s)]
*  details on that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=150.24s)]
*  So after they lured him to campus, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=151.32s)]
*  the group then rallied others at [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=154.2s)]
*  the college using an alumni group [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=156.88s)]
*  chat, a move that provoked [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=159.56s)]
*  the rabid response from the dozens [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=161.68s)]
*  who participated in the event, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=164.28s)]
*  according to the statement. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=166.56s)]
*  Now in a follow up interview with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=168.8s)]
*  campus police, the woman, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=170.88s)]
*  Brainard reiterated that she had [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=173.28s)]
*  been the victim of unsolicited [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  contact, but the service member [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=177.36s)]
*  told a very different story. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=179.52s)]
*  He told campus police that he had [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  been home to attend his [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=183.56s)]
*  grandmother's funeral and began [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  messaging with someone on Tinder [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  because he just wanted to be around [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=189.08s)]
*  people that were happy, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=191.12s)]
*  according to the statement. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=192.52s)]
*  He and Brainard planned to connect, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=194.12s)]
*  he told police, and she invited him [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  to meet at a campus alumni hall, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=199.28s)]
*  according to the statement. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  He had been inside the building for [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=203.6s)]
*  a few minutes, the statement says, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=205.72s)]
*  when a group of people came out of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=208.0s)]
*  nowhere and started calling him [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=209.92s)]
*  a pedophile and alleging that he [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=211.76s)]
*  liked 17 year old girls. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=213.92s)]
*  He was chased to his car and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  physically assaulted. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=218.48s)]
*  Once he was able to flee campus, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=220.44s)]
*  he called the police, but [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  was he actually a predator? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=223.76s)]
*  Well, police say there was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  absolutely zero evidence, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=227.48s)]
*  no evidence that the man had been [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=229.44s)]
*  engaged in sex with a minor. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=232.12s)]
*  A review of Tinder messages showed [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=234.36s)]
*  the service member believed that he [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=236.12s)]
*  was actually meeting with [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=237.88s)]
*  an 18 year old, the statement says. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=239.04s)]
*  The woman's profile indicated she [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=240.76s)]
*  was 18. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=243.04s)]
*  When officers followed up with [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=244.24s)]
*  Brainard about where the information [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=246.0s)]
*  about an underage girl came from, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=248.16s)]
*  the statement adds she could not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=250.16s)]
*  answer. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=252.16s)]
*  So Randall, one of the students [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=253.56s)]
*  who was charged in this case, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=255.36s)]
*  told police that the plot was [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=257.0s)]
*  modeled on to catch a predator. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=258.56s)]
*  And it's a discontinued show for [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=260.96s)]
*  anyone who's unfamiliar with it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=263.12s)]
*  That was all about catching [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=265.84s)]
*  pedophiles who thought that they [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=267.56s)]
*  were going to meet up with [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=269.56s)]
*  an underage person. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=270.96s)]
*  He reported that it was like [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=272.52s)]
*  the Chris Hansen videos where you [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=274.16s)]
*  catch a predator and either call [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=276.08s)]
*  the police or kick their ass, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=277.92s)]
*  the statement says, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=279.6s)]
*  referring to the host of to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=280.84s)]
*  catch a predator. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=282.4s)]
*  He said the show is a big thing on [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=283.76s)]
*  TikTok currently. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=285.52s)]
*  So six of the students who are [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=287.84s)]
*  have been charged with kidnapping [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=289.76s)]
*  and conspiracy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  Two other students were accused of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  additional crimes. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=294.44s)]
*  Kelsey Brainard, who's at the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=295.96s)]
*  center of this, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  was charged with intimidation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=298.44s)]
*  And Kevin Carroll, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  another 18 year old, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=301.44s)]
*  was charged with assault and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=302.96s)]
*  battery with a dangerous weapon. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=304.84s)]
*  It's so sick and it shocks me that, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=307.32s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about adults [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=309.56s)]
*  here, yeah, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=311.76s)]
*  they're college students, but still. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=312.64s)]
*  It amazes me that they thought that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  they could do this to an innocent [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=316.28s)]
*  person and just get away with it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=317.52s)]
*  Yeah, so this story has everything [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=319.08s)]
*  I hate, vigilante violence, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=321.44s)]
*  injustice, these stupid pranks that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  come out of social media, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=326.52s)]
*  it drives me crazy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  So look, my main thing is justice, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=329.96s)]
*  that's why my book is called [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=332.4s)]
*  Justice is Coming, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=334.44s)]
*  that's why we named Justice [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=336.0s)]
*  Democrats, Justice Democrats. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  And so when people take stuff in [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=340.84s)]
*  their own hands like this and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=342.96s)]
*  mangle it and it isn't even true, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=345.12s)]
*  I loathe it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=348.6s)]
*  So, two disparate points here, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=350.44000000000005s)]
*  one is you really got to talk to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=353.12s)]
*  your kids about social media. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I emphasize to my kids all [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=358.56s)]
*  the time, not real, not real, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=360.6s)]
*  you should never assume it's real, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=364.8s)]
*  You want to verify, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=365.32000000000005s)]
*  go verify it, etc. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  But I feel like that should be part [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=367.56s)]
*  of our education system now. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  And so just be careful with what [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=372.48s)]
*  you're seeing in social media. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=374.76000000000005s)]
*  What I mean not real, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=377.64s)]
*  I don't mean news, etc. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=378.68s)]
*  Of course, always be careful with [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=380.08s)]
*  news or things, different things [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=381.68s)]
*  that you hear or see in social [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=383.36s)]
*  media. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=384.76s)]
*  But I mean these kind of pranks and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=385.28s)]
*  these kind of conspiracies and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=387.28s)]
*  these wild, not so ideas that's [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=389.08s)]
*  spread online. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=391.0s)]
*  And if you think grown ups believe [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=392.08s)]
*  it too much, wait till you get a [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=394.08s)]
*  load of kids that are under 18 or [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=395.84s)]
*  in this case college. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=397.76s)]
*  And then I've always had mixed [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=399.28s)]
*  feelings about to catch [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=400.76s)]
*  a predator, and this confirms my [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  mixed feelings. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=403.44s)]
*  On the one hand, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=404.24s)]
*  they're catching bad guys, so [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=404.84s)]
*  that's a good thing, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=405.88s)]
*  They're doing it for entertainment, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=407.24s)]
*  let's keep it real, so [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=408.96s)]
*  there's something a little weird [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=409.88s)]
*  and sick about that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=411.4s)]
*  But as you were doing the story, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=412.52s)]
*  Ana, it made me think, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=414.8s)]
*  I wonder if this is at least a part [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  of the reason why QAnon believed [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=419.12s)]
*  that everybody in the country was [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=421.64s)]
*  pedophiles. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=424.12s)]
*  because if you watch to catch [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=425.2s)]
*  a predator, and you didn't have [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=426.88s)]
*  any context, you would think, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=428.88s)]
*  my God, half the guys in the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=430.88s)]
*  country are pedophiles. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=432.36s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if to catch [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=435.64s)]
*  a predator had anything to do with [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=437.56s)]
*  QAnon thinking that Democrats [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=439.68s)]
*  specifically are all pedophiles, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=441.76s)]
*  but- [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=444.64s)]
*  the Democrat part is just of course [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=445.36s)]
*  partisanship and nuts and so. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=447.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=449.0s)]
*  Well, the whole thing is nuts, but [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=449.52s)]
*  it was driven by the right wing, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  that's why they said Democrats. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  But as to why they thought it was [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=454.2s)]
*  so incredibly pervasive [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=456.12s)]
*  throughout the country. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, look, I don't know how [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=459.96s)]
*  pervasive it is, but [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=461.96s)]
*  I mean, sexual assault is very [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  common. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  It's way more common than I [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=466.0s)]
*  realized it was growing up. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=467.44s)]
*  And I feel tremendously lucky that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  I was never in any way abused as [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=471.68s)]
*  a kid because so many people have [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=473.76s)]
*  been abused when they were [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  children. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=477.6s)]
*  And it's really heartbreaking. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=478.36s)]
*  But I wanted to just quickly go [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=479.76s)]
*  back to your point about how you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=481.6s)]
*  felt in regard to that popular show [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=483.64s)]
*  to catch a predator. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=486.16s)]
*  On that issue, on that point, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=487.92s)]
*  I think it's really important to [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=490.08s)]
*  understand that on that specific [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=492.64000000000004s)]
*  issue on that specific show, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=494.88s)]
*  I disagree with you. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=496.92s)]
*  I never once felt bad. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=498.44s)]
*  All of these people were disgusting [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=499.64000000000004s)]
*  and I'm glad that they had what was [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=501.6s)]
*  coming to them. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=503.64000000000004s)]
*  However, these trends on social [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=504.68s)]
*  media where they're trying to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=507.24s)]
*  mirror that show, even in instances [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=509.72s)]
*  where a guy did think he was going [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=512.72s)]
*  to meet up with a young person, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=515.32s)]
*  there have been many examples where [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=517.9200000000001s)]
*  they did think they were going to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=521.0s)]
*  meet up with a young person. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=523.52s)]
*  And then they proceed to beat [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=525.68s)]
*  the guy down on camera, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  which shouldn't you? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  Even if the person is a pedophile, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=530.24s)]
*  I don't think that gives you the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=532.1999999999999s)]
*  right to go around beating people [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=534.04s)]
*  up, right? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=536.04s)]
*  Vigilante violence is not a good [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=536.64s)]
*  thing, we shouldn't be celebrating [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  it. But again, some of these guys [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=541.04s)]
*  clearly had mental health issues [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=543.36s)]
*  and maybe didn't know exactly what [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=545.76s)]
*  they were doing. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=548.28s)]
*  So I think that being bloodied [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=549.68s)]
*  bothered me a lot. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=552.04s)]
*  So I have absolutely no sympathy for [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=553.56s)]
*  pedophiles. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=556.4s)]
*  But it's one thing to do this [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=558.12s)]
*  through a professionally produced [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=559.88s)]
*  show that involves law enforcement. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=562.16s)]
*  It's something entirely different [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=564.6s)]
*  for rando content creators on [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=566.76s)]
*  TikTok and YouTube to do this. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=568.46s)]
*  Yeah, so of course, absolutely no [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=570.48s)]
*  one has sympathy for pedophiles. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=572.72s)]
*  And you're absolutely right, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=575.2s)]
*  sexual assault and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=577.24s)]
*  pedophiles are unfortunately far, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=578.64s)]
*  far, far too pervasive to begin [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  with in reality. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=583.5999999999999s)]
*  So there's good reason for people [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  to be deeply concerned about it, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=587.68s)]
*  taking in a weird political [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  direction obviously made no sense. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=590.8s)]
*  But the part that I'm concerned [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=592.9599999999999s)]
*  about Anna or made me feel kind of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  queasy was not that they caught [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=597.16s)]
*  the pedophiles, not that they had [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=599.4s)]
*  got just I love that part. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=601.8s)]
*  It's that they did it on TV. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=603.76s)]
*  It felt a little like [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=605.88s)]
*  the Roman Coliseum. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=607.04s)]
*  Let's go see somebody get fed to [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=609.04s)]
*  the lions. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=610.36s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=611.12s)]
*  I do, but I still disagree. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=614.16s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=617.0s)]
*  that's a debate as old as time. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=618.2s)]
*  Since that show has been on, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=621.0s)]
*  right? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=622.52s)]
*  It has a good side of catching [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=623.28s)]
*  the pedophiles, it has the bad side [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=624.64s)]
*  of doing it for entertainment [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=626.2s)]
*  purposes. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=627.6s)]
*  And it's just using pedophilia in [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=629.24s)]
*  any way for entertainment. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=632.08s)]
*  I don't know, just viscerally. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=634.28s)]
*  Look- [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=636.16s)]
*  I feel uncomfortable with it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=636.68s)]
*  I totally get your argument and [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=638.92s)]
*  you're right, there is something [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  sick about doing this as a form of [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=642.6s)]
*  entertainment. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=644.4s)]
*  Nonetheless, look, humans, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=646.0s)]
*  they want revenge when there's bad [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=648.24s)]
*  people out there doing bad things. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=650.88s)]
*  I certainly do. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  So when we're talking about a man [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  that has a healthy mind and decides [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=658.12s)]
*  to victimize children in this way, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=660.92s)]
*  I get why people want to see that [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=664.1600000000001s)]
*  person get confronted. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=667.0s)]
*  Let's put it that way. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18GGU8v5zk&t=670.2s)]
